Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by A. Abu-Akel (Language and Speech, 1997[Oct-Dec], 40[4], 331-351). It is the stated editorial policy of this journal that only original work not previously published elsewhere will be accepted for publication in "Language and Speech". Accordingly, "Language and Speech" retracts the above paper in full, as it has recently been discovered that portions of it were previously published elsewhere by Jonathan Fine. The editors, reviewers, and publisher wish to state that at the time this paper was submitted for publication, it was understood from Mr. Abu-Akel that this was his original work. We very much regret and apologize for any damage caused by the publication of his paper in this journal.

Abstract = {Retracts an article by George A. Ricaurte et al (Science, 2002[Sep], Vol 297[5590], 2260-2263). The authors discovered that the drug used to treat all but one animal in that report came from a bottle that contained (+)-methamphetamine instead of the intended drug, (±)MDMA. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2002-18729-002[/rid]). Notes that the prevailing view is that the popular recreational drug (+-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or "ecstasy") is a selective serotonin neurotoxin in animals and possibly in humans. Nonhuman primates (squirrel monkeys and baboons) were used to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of a dose regimen modeled closely after one used by MDMA users at all-night dance parties. Subjects (Ss) were given MDMA at a dosage of 2 mg/kg, 3 times, at 3 hr intervals, for a total dose of 6 mg/kg. The authors also explored the possibility that monkeys with MDMA-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity were at an increased risk for },

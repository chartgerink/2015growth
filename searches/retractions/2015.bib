Multiple studies have demonstrated that resolution in working memory (WM) declines as the number of stored items increases. Discrete-resource models predict that this decline should reach a stable plateau at relatively small set sizes because item limits prevent additional information from being encoded into WM at larger set sizes. By contrast, flexible-resource models predict that the monotonic declines in precision will continue indefinitely as set size increases and resources are distributed without any fixed item limit.

Abstract = {This article discusses retraction of the article, In Sickness and in Health? Physical Illness as a Risk Factor for Marital Dissolution in Later Life by Amelia Karraker and Kenzie Latham. There is an important error in the coding of the dependent variable that yields a divorce risk estimate (6%) that differs substantially from that (32%) reported in the previously published paper. This miscoding affected the coding of some continuously married marriages, reducing the percentage of continuously married marriages. This miscoding alters all results and invalidates the previously published results. In the corrected analysis, it is found that wife’s illness onset is a statistically significant predictor of divorce but husband’s is not, as is being reported in the previously published paper. However, in the corrected analysis, the authors fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the coefficients for wife’s pooled illness onset and husband’s pooled illness onset.

This article has been retracted because it was evaluated by reviewers in the context of some findings that we no longer believe to be robust.

Past work has suggested that neuronal oscillations coordinate the cellular assemblies that represent items in working memory (WM).

Abstract = {Objective: To explore whether the trigeminocervical reflexes (TCRs) show a reflex receptive field organization in the brainstem. Methods: The facial skin of 16 healthy subjects was electrically stimulated at nine sites reflecting the distribution of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. The reflex-evoked EMG responses were measured bilaterally from the neck muscles and the head and neck kinematic reactions were detected. Results: TCRs are site dependent. There was a vertical gradient in the magnitude of the reflex responses. EMG and kinematic reflexes were larger when evoked from ophthalmic and maxillary sites than from mandibular ones. The reflex responses exhibited a crossed right–left behavior. Stimulation of the lateral sites evoked larger reflex responses in the contralateral trapezium muscle as well as head rotation and neck bending away from the stimulated side.

In the present study, we used electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), an animal model of ECT, to identify proteins possibly involved in the preventive effect of ECS on stress-induced neuronal atrophy in the hippocampus. Rats were stressed daily using the 21-day 6h daily restraint stress paradigm and subjected to sham seizures, a single ECS on the last day of the restraint period or daily repeated seizures for 10 consecutive days during the end of the restraint period. Consistent with previous findings, dendritic atrophy was observed in the CA3c hippocampal region of chronically stressed rats. In addition, we confirmed our recent findings of increased spine density in the CA1 region following chronic restraint stress.

Abstract = {The mechanisms controlling cortical dendrite initiation and targeting are poorly understood. Multiphoton imaging of developing mouse cortex reveals that apical dendrites emerge by direct transformation of the neuron’s leading process during the terminal phase of neuronal migration. During this ∼110 min period, the dendritic arbor increases ∼2.5-fold in size and migration arrest occurs below the first stable branch point in the developing arbor. This dendritic outgrowth is triggered at the time of leading process contact with the marginal zone (MZ) and occurs primarily by neurite extension into the extracellular matrix of the MZ. In reeler cortices that lack the secreted glycoprotein Reelin, a subset of neurons completed migration but then retracted and reorganized their arbor in a tangential direction away from the MZ soon after migration arrest. For these reeler neurons, the tangential oriented primary neurites were longer lived than the radially oriented primary neurites, whereas th},

Abstract = {To further the science and practice of any discipline, avoidance of errors in collecting, analyzing, and reporting study data is paramount in supporting the evidence-base of our profession and poses a serious challenge to researchers and journal editors alike. And although retraction rates have risen in the research literature, there has been limited treatment of the process and procedures detailing how to prevent and ethically handle research errors. In response to their experience in the retraction of the “Inpatient Pediatric Psychology Consultation–Liaison Practice Survey” manuscript (Kullgren et al., 2015b), the authors make specific recommendations for the prevention, discovery, disclosure, and correction of errors in research and publication that are particularly applicable to busy clinician researchers. The authors focus on increasing awareness of risks for mistakes, ways to improve the research process, being mindful of research competencies, and creating a culture of integrit},

At the request of the authors, the following article from the June 2013 issue is being retracted. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-27552-001[/rid].) Perceptual grouping can lead observers to perceive a multielement scene as a smaller number of hierarchical units. Past work has shown that grouping enables more elements to be stored in visual working memory (WM). Although this may appear to contradict so-called discrete resource models that argue for fixed item limits in WM storage, it is also possible that grouping reduces the effective number of “items” in the display. To test this hypothesis, we examined how mnemonic resolution declined as the number of items to },

Abstract = {A hallmark of the nervous system is the presence of precise patterns of connections between different types of neurons. Many mechanisms can be used to establish specificity, including homophilic adhesion and synaptic refinement, but the range of strategies used across the nervous system remains unclear. To broaden the understanding of how neurons find their targets, we studied the developing murine cochlea, where two classes of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), type I and type II, navigate together to the sensory epithelium and then diverge to contact inner hair cells (IHCs) or outer hair cells (OHCs), respectively. Neurons with type I and type II morphologies are apparent before birth, suggesting that target selection might be accomplished by excluding type I processes from the OHC region. However, because type I processes appear to overshoot into type II territory postnatally, specificity may also depend on elimination of inappropriate synapses. To resolve these differences, we analyz},

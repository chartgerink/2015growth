Abstract = {Investigated influences on the development and retraction of unusual structures during early bilingual language development, by examining non-target syntactic structures produced by young German–English bilingual children. Four children were studied (audio and video recordings) from roughly 2–4 yrs of age. The results are described as supporting the contentions of the Competition Model that language acquisition proceeds through orientation to surface structures, and that cue competition across languages changes the weighting of cues within the language. The retreat from non-target structures was made possible through the children's attention to contrasts between the languages and the need to resolve structural incompatibilities within the language.

Abstract = {Maximal responses are often used as a measure of intrinsic activity or efficacy, but cannot be directly equated to efficacy. Using irreversible antagonists, estimates of efficacy can be obtained that may be less dependent on specific conditions. This study characterizes the intrinsic activity of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT])1A agonists by examining the effects of an irreversible antagonist on their ability to produce 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses. The effects of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) on the ability of 5-HT1A agonists to produce lower-lip retraction (LLR) in male rats were studied. Results show that in the absence of EEDQ, each 5-HT1A agonist produced full effects, the rank order of potency being: S 14506 > 8-OH-DPAT > buspirone > ipsapirone. EEDQ decreased the number of 5-HT1A binding sites and shifted the dose-response curves of each agonist either to the right or, at higher EEDQ doses, to the right and downward. The manner in which these},

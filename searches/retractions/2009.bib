Abstract = {The effect of the potent soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1H outgrowth and triggered -[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) on neurite outgrowth and retraction was investigated in PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. ODQ inhibited neuriteneurite retraction in the cells stimulated with nerve growth factor (NGF), staurosporine, or Y-27632. The nitric oxide (NO) scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) had little effect on neurite outgrowth induced by Y-27632 or staurosporine. In the presence of ODQ, treatment of the cells with the cell-permeable cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP failed to retrigger Y-27632- and staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, the depletion of sGC by RNA interference failed to prevent Y-27632- and staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that the NO/sGC/cGMP signaling cascade is not critically involved in ODQ-induced neurite remodeling. The MEK inhibitor PD98059},

Abstract = {Cell motility drives many biological processes, including immune responses and embryonic development. In the brain, microglia are immune cells that survey and scavenge brain tissue using elaborate and motile cell processes. The motility of these processes is guided by the local release of chemoattractants. However, most microglial processes retract during prolonged brain injury or disease. This hallmark of brain inflammation remains unexplained. We identified a molecular pathway in mouse and human microglia that converted ATP-driven process extension into process retraction during inflammation. This chemotactic reversal was driven by upregulation of the A2A adenosine receptor coincident with P2Y₁₂ downregulation. Thus, A2A receptor stimulation by adenosine, a breakdown product of extracellular ATP, caused activated microglia to assume their characteristic amoeboid morphology during brain inflammation. Our results indicate that purine nucleotides provide an opportunity for contextdepen},

Abstract = {Introduction. The flaccid penis undergoes retraction upon contraction of the dartos muscle. These contractions are most pronounced in the situations of cold, stress, and upon exercising, and can be the source of embarrassment to those who have a hyperactive retraction reflex, especially when exposed to their partners or to others in showers and dressing rooms, despite a normal and satisfactory length in the erect state. Aim. In this work, we propose an alternative to surgery and penile extenders for alleviating penile retraction, by injection of botulinum toxin into the dartos to induce muscle relaxation. This is the first report of the technique. Methods. Ten male patients complaining of a short penis exclusively in the flaccid state, despite normal and satisfactory erect and outstretched lengths, were selected for the study. One hundred units of BOTOX were injected into the dartos muscle. Main Outcome Measures. Frequency and amplitude of penile retraction, flaccid unstretched length},

Abstract = {Presents the retracted article, Hybrid voltage sensor imaging from genetically targeted neurons in hippocampal and spinal cord slices by D. Wang et al. (2009). Shortly after this manuscript was accepted for publication, new experiments indicated that brain slices expressing membrane-targeted fluorescent proteins can give rise to electrically evoked fluorescence changes in the absence of dipicrylamine. Since the same fluorescent proteins expressed in cultured cells give voltage-dependent fluorescence changes only in the presence of dipicrylamine, it was unable to explain the signals reported in hippocampal and spinal slices. Thus although these signals do arise from genetically targeted cells and are blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of electrical activity, it can no longer be said to what extent they reflect resonant energy transfer. This matter requires further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Structural remodeling of neurons occurs during development, regeneration, and in relation to learning and memory acquisition processes. These processes are associated with reconfiguration of the cytoskeleton, and are accompanied by adjustments of the plasma membrane surface area. Using cultured Aplysia neurons, we examined the role of membrane budgeting and the submembrane actin skeleton in determining the dimensions and shape of neurons. We found that the dimensions and cytoarchitecture of cultured neurons reach a steady state by maintaining a balance between constitutive plasma membrane retrieval and insertion. Constitutive membrane retrieval and the addition of Golgi-derived membranes are not coupled. Therefore, inhibition of Golgi-derived membrane supply by brefeldin A (BFA) leads to total retraction of the neurites. The process of BFA-induced neurite retraction is reversible upon washout. BFA-induced neurite retraction is associated with orderly retrograde shortening of the micro},

Abstract = {Axonal regression is utilized to refine neuronal circuits during development, but the dynamic properties of such regression remain largely unknown. We used confocal time-lapse imaging to examine the regression of single enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-labeled axons in corticospinal slice cocultures. By acquiring images at long (1 day) and short (30-60 min) intervals on days 5-13 in vitro, we detected three types of regressive events: 1) retractions, 2) amputations (referred to as autoaxotomy), and 3) degeneration. Retractions proceeded at some constant rate for up to 3 hours and then paused or switched to another constant rate, apparently shifting stepwise among three retraction rates (6, 12, 17 μm/hours). Autoaxotomy was a previously unreported strategy for regression. It occurred spontaneously, either at a proximal branch neck or at a distal end. Axons also underwent a form of degeneration that had several novel characteristics. Degenerating axons showed bright bead-like spots a},

Following publication in the International Journal of Neuroscience, the Publisher retracts this paper on the basis that the information and data it contained was plagiarized from a copyrighted source. Specifically, the information and data the article contained was copied from “Fisica della Mente” by Marco Bonafede, which published in April 2000.

Abstract = {Reports a retraction of "The effect of overwing hatch placement on evacuation from smaller transport aircraft" by Rebecca L. Wilson and Helen C. Muir (Ergonomics, 2009[Aug], Vol 52[8], 931-938). The articles were published prematurely, as a result of an oversight, for which Taylor & Francis apologises to the Authors and Editors. The articles will be published as intended in a forthcoming Special Issue of Ergonomics on Human Factors in Aviation. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-11509-004[/rid].) Overwing exits are installed on a number of smaller transport aircraft. With a traditional overwing exit, once released, the hatch is not attached to the fuselage and will fall into the cabin. To operate, the hatch has to be brought inwards, manoeuvred and placed in a location where it does not obstruct egress. Accidents and experimental studies have shown that the hatch is not always disposed of into an appropriate location. Evacuation trials from a },

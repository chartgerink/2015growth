Abstract = {Chronic stress may have different effects on hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neuronal morphology and function depending upon hormonal status, but rarely are manipulations of stress and gonadal steroids combined. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of chronic restraint and 17β-estradiol replacement on CA3 and CA1 dendritic morphology and spatial learning in ovariectomized (OVX) female Sprague-Dawley rats. OVX rats were implanted with 25% 17β-estradiol, 100% cholesterol, or blank silastic capsules and then chronically restrained (6h/d/21d) or kept in home cages. 17β-Estradiol or cholesterol prevented stress-induced CA3 dendritic retraction, increased CA1 apical spine density, and altered CA1 spine shape. The combination of chronic stress and 17β-estradiol facilitated water maze acquisition compared to chronic stress + blank implants and nonstressed controls + 17β-estradiol. To further investigate the interaction between 17β-estradiol and stress on hippocampal morphology, experiment 2 was cond},

This original article has been retracted from publication in the Asia Pacific Journal of Counselling and Psychotherapy. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-16280-005[/rid]). This paper explores the current development of school counseling in Japan. The author reviews a brief history of school counseling and provides a global perspective on the current development of school counseling in the context of the school and the educational system in Japan. The current development of the school counselor and school counseling is examined from the point of view of its educational and cultural framework. The focus of school counseling in Japan is to provide therapeutic interventions to the students’ psychological problems by individual counseling and through support and car},

Abstract = {Throughout the nervous system, neurons restrict their connections to specific depths or "layers" of their targets to constrain the type and number of synapses they make. Despite the importance of lamina-specific synaptic connectivity, the mechanisms that give rise to this feature in mammals remain poorly understood. Here we examined the cellular events underlying the formation of lamina-specific retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axonal projections to the superior colliculus (SC) of the mouse. By combining a genetically encoded marker of a defined RGC subtype (OFF-αRGCs) with serial immunoelectron microscopy, we resolved the ultrastructure of axon terminals fated for laminar stabilization versus those fated for removal. We found that OFF-αRGCs form synapses across the full depth of the retinorecipient SC before undergoing lamina-specific arbor retraction and synapse elimination to arrive at their mature, restricted pattern of connectivity. Interestingly, we did not observe evidence of axon d},

Abstract = {The circuit for binocular vision and stereopsis is established at the optic chiasm, where retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons diverge into the ipsilateral and contralateral optic tracts. In the mouse retina, ventrotem-poral (VT) RGCs express the guidance receptor EphBl, which interacts with the repulsive guidance cue ephrin-B2 on radial glia at the optic chiasm to direct VT RGC axons ipsilaterally. RGCs in the ventral retina also express EphB2, which interacts with ephrin-B2, whereas dorsal RGCs express low levels of EphB receptors. To investigate how growth cones of RGCs from different retinal regions respond upon initial contact with ephrin-B2, we utilized time-lapse imaging to characterize the effects of ephrin-B2 on growth cone collapse and axon retraction in real time. We demonstrate that bath application of ephrin-B2 induces rapid and sustained growth cone collapse and axon retraction in VT RGC axons, whereas contralaterally-projecting dorsotemporal RGCs display moderate growth co},

Abstract = {Is orienting of spatial attention dependent on normal functioning of the ocular motor system? We investigated the role of motor pathways in covert orienting (attentional orienting without performing eye movements) by studying three patients suffering from Duane Retraction Syndrome—a congenital impairment in executing horizontal eye movements restricted to specific gaze directions. Patients showed a typical exogenous (reflexive) attention effect when the target was presented in visual fields to which they could perform an eye movement. This effect was not present when the target was presented in the visual field to which they could not perform eye movements. These findings stress the link between eye movements and attention. Specifically, they bring out the importance of the ability to execute appropriate eye movements for attentional orienting. We suggest that the relevant information about eye movement ability is provided by feedback from lower motor structures to higher attentional },

This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief of Academy of Management Journal. Formal investigations by the Academy of Management Journal and an affiliated university of Professor Ulrich Lichtenthaler have revealed ethical violations in research practices. Those violations center on the larger data collection effort that forms the foundation for this article as well as the empirics and reporting in the article itself. Independent re-analysis has been unable to replicate the findings as reported in this article and other journals have retracted other published pieces from the larger data collection effort.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling is critical for neuronal development and transmission. Recruitment of TrkB receptors to lipid rafts has been shown to be necessary for the activation of specific signaling pathways and modulation of neurotransmitter release by BDNF. Since TrkB receptors are known to be modulated by adenosine A2A receptor activation, we hypothesized that activation of A2A receptors could influence },

Abstract = {Stress-sensitive psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder are characterized by deficits in fear extinction and dysfunction of corticolimbic circuits mediating extinction. Chronic stress facilitates fear conditioning, impairs extinction, and produces dendritic proliferation in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a critical site of plasticity for extinction. Acute stress impairs extinction, alters plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex-to-BLA circuit, and causes dendritic retraction in the medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we examined extinction learning and basolateral amygdala pyramidal neuron morphology in adult male rats following a single elevated platform stress. Acute stress impaired extinction acquisition and memory, and produced dendritic retraction and increased mushroom spine density in basolateral amygdala neurons in the right hemisphere. Unexpectedly, irrespective of stress, rats that underwent fear and extinction testing showed basolateral amygdala dendritic },

Abstract = {Spontaneous activity supports developmental processes in many brain regions during embryogenesis, and the spatial extent and frequency of the spontaneous activity are tightly regulated by stage. In the developing mouse hindbrain, spontaneous activity propagates widely and the waves can cover the entire hindbrain at E11.5. The activity then retracts to waves that are spatially restricted to the rostral midline at E13.5, before disappearing altogether by E15.5. However, the mechanism of retraction is unknown. We studied passive membrane properties of cells that are spatiotemporally relevant to the pattern of retraction inmouse embryonic hindbrain using whole-cell patch clamp and Cai2+ imaging techniques. We find that membrane excitability progressively decreases due to hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential and increased resting conductance density between E11.5 and E15.5, in a spatiotemporal pattern correlated with the retraction sequence. Retraction can be acutely reversed by},

Stapel (Self and Identity, 2011[Apr], Vol 10[2], 166-184). The original article has been retracted by agreement of the journal Editor, the Publisher and the Co-authors. The retraction has been agreed after the Noort Committee determined fraud in the publication. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-05052-003[/rid]). This study demonstrates that the structure of social comparison effects depends on the type of activated self-cognitions and the type of measure that is used. When neutral or negative self-cognitions are activated, social comparison information is processed defensively (both upward and downward comparison standards lead to positive explicit self-ratings). On an implicit level, however, upward comparison standards increase negativity. When positive self-cognitions are activated, explici},

Abstract = {Neurons are differentiated postmitotic cells residing in G₀ phase of the cell cycle and are unable to proceed through G₁ phase, in which cyclinD1 needs to be up-regulated for initiation. Yet, a growing body of evidence has shown that cell cycle re-activation via cyclinD1 up-regulation drives neurons into apoptosis. By contrast, there is also evidence demonstrating cell cycle proteins playing roles in neuronal differentiation. cyclinD1 has been shown to be differently regulated by protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) in various mitotic cells. Based on these different effects, we investigated the role of PKC-α on cyclinD1 regulation in hippocampal neurons. Neurons were treated with PKC activator, PMA, and analysed for subcellular distributions of PKC-α and cyclinD1. Remarkably, PMA treatment increased nuclear PKC-α and cyclinD1, but not PKC-ε in hippocampal neurons. Increases in nuclear PKC-α and cyclinD1 were accompanied by microtubule re-organisation via increases in tau and retinoblastoma },

For 127 of these 174, we found both the article and a retraction or correction statement. Since eight of the 127 published statements consisted of simply the word 'retracted,' our analysis focused on the remaining 119 for which a more detailed retraction or correction was published. Of these 119 statements, only 41.2% mentioned ethics at all (and only 32.8% named a specific ethical problem such as fabrication, falsification or plagiarism), whereas the other 58.8% described the reason for retraction or correction as error, loss of data or replication failure when misconduct was actually at issu},

Abstract = {L-type voltage gated calcium channels have an important role in neuronal development by promoting dendritic growth and arborization. A point mutation in the gene encoding CaV1.2 causes Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We report that channels with the Timothy syndrome alteration cause activity-dependent dendrite retraction in rat and mouse neurons and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Dendrite retraction was independent of calcium permeation through the mutant channel, was associated with ectopic activation of RhoA and was inhibited by overexpression of the channel-associated GTPase Gem. These results suggest that CaV1.2 can activate RhoA signaling independently of Ca2+ and provide insights into the cellular basis of Timothy syndrome and other ASDs.

Several theoretical perspectives predict that social comparisons lead to simple, default-driven effects when triggered outside of conscious awareness. These theoretical perspectives differ, however, in the default effects they predict. Some theories argue for self-evaluative contrast, whereas others argue for self-evaluative assimilation.

The Levelt Committee established fraud in this article, committed by author Stapel. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2007-12302-005[/rid]). In two studies, we compared the impact of cold emotion concept primes with induced hot emotional states on subsequent social judgments.

Other blots depicting actin bands, used to compare blots depicting Erk1/2 and Erk5, were inserted into the figure upside down.

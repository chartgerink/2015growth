Abstract = {Investigated the production of lower lip retraction (LLR) in male rats by the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and the effect of the putative 5-HT1A antagonists pindolol and (1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)-butyl])-piperazine (NAN190). 8-OH-DPAT (0.125–2.0 mg/kg) caused a dose-related increase in LLR. Pindolol (10–40 mg/kg) and NAN190 (2.5–20 mg/kg) produced a dose-related block of 8-OH-DPAT-induced LLR. When administered alone, pindolol also caused LLR, thus suggesting that pindolol behaves as a partial agonist in this model. This was not the case with NAN190, which failed to produce LLR; however, NAN190 produced a dose-related block of the pindolol-induced LLR. Thus, the LLR model can be used to detect 5-HT1A agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes a case of Koro, or the genital retraction syndrome, in a 21-yr-old man in which the symptom of Koro was secondary to a major depressive disorder. This is the 1st such case to be reported from Ireland. This case was typical to the description of Western patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the onset and characteristics of morphine-induced antinociception in 2 parallel experiments with rats (aged 2–21 days). One measure of reactivity to pain, limb retraction from a hotplate, was utilized for 3 different limbs (forepaw, hindpaw, and tail) to chart the development of opioid sensitivity. Morphine-induced antinociception, even in 2-day-old Ss, was obtained for all limbs, in a dose-related fashion, and reached peak sensitivity at 6–7 days of age. Data demonstrate early antinociception to low doses of an opiate and establish that the pain system, like positive reinforcement systems, is opiate sensitive.

Abstract = {Injured axons of the adult CNS undergo lengthy retraction from the initial site of axotomy after spinal cord injury. Macrophage infiltration correlates spatiotemporally with this deleterious phenomenon, but the direct involvement of these inflammatory cells has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we examined the role of macrophages in axonal retraction within the dorsal columns after spinal cord injury in vivo and found that retraction occurred between days 2 and 28 after lesion and that the ends of injured axons were associated with ED-1+ cells. Clodronate liposome-mediated depletion of infiltrating macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in axonal retraction; however, we saw no evidence of regeneration. We used time-lapse imaging of adult dorsal root ganglion neurons in an in vitro model of the glial scar to examine macrophage-axon interactions and observed that adhesive contacts and considerable physical interplay between macrophages and dystrophic axons led to ext},

Abstract = {Disconjugate oculomotor adaptation is driven by the need to maintain binocular vision. Since binocular vision in Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) patients is normal in half of their horizontal field of gaze (i.e., sound-side of gaze), we wondered whether oculomotor adaptive capabilities are efficient despite such a severe impairment of eye motility towards the other half of the horizontal field of gaze (i.e., affected-side gaze). We compared properties of horizontal saccades of patients with congenital unilateral Duane Retraction Syndrome type I in binocular viewing and monocular viewing conditions by simultaneously recording both eyes with the search coil technique. Our results show a mismatch between the pulse and the step signal of the innervation for saccades. When tested in the affected eye viewing condition (sound eye covered), the eyes showed not only similarly-directed increases of the saccadic gain (pulse signal) in the two eyes but also disjunctive post-saccadic drifts (step },

Abstract = {Clinical studies on cancer patients have revealed that chemotherapy is associated with long-term cognitive impairment. In the present study, we used a rat model to evaluate the effects of the anticancer drug cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) on spatial learning, memory, and the dendritic morphology of neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus. The drug was observed to induce deficits in the long-term spatial memory function but not in the spatial learning and recent memory, as was assessed by performing the Morris water maze test. In the Ara-C treated rats, retraction of the apical dendrites was noted in the neurons in the ACC but not in the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal region CA1. Our in vivo adult rat model of neurotoxicity provides data on the long-term cognitive and cellular morphometric alterations in the frontal lobes induced by Ara-C treatment.

Abstract = {This study provides current data on key questions about retraction of scientific articles. Findings confirm that the rate of retractions remains low but is increasing. The most commonly cited reason for retraction was research error or inability to reproduce results; the rate from research misconduct is an underestimate, since some retractions necessitated by research misconduct were reported as being due to inability to reproduce. Retraction by parties other than authors is increasing, especially for research misconduct. Although retractions are on average occurring sooner after publication than in the past, citation analysis shows that they are not being recognised by subsequent users of the work. Findings suggest that editors and institutional officials are taking more responsibility for correcting the scientific record but that reasons published in the retraction notice are not always reliable. More aggressive means of notification to the scientific community appear to be necessar},

Abstract = {The present manuscript treats the problem of adapting a neural signal processing system whose parameters belong to a curved manifold, which is assumed to possess the structure of a Lie group. Neural system parameter adapting is effected by optimizing a system performance criterion. Riemannian-gradient-based optimization is suggested, which cannot be performed by standard additive stepping because of the curved nature of the parameter space. Retraction-based stepping is discussed, instead, along with a companion stepsize-schedule selection procedure. A case-study of learning by optimization of a non-quadratic criterion is discussed in detail. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Axon guidance molecules trigger a cascade of local signal in growth cones and evoke various morphologic responses, including axon attraction, repulsion, elongation, and retraction. However, little is known about whether subcellular compartments, other than axonal growth cones, control axon outgrowth. We found that in isolated dentate granule cells, local application of glutamate to the somatodendritic areas, but not the axon itself, induced rapid axon retraction, during which a calcium wave propagated from the somata to the axon terminals. The calcium wave and axon retraction were both inhibited by blockade of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and intracellular calcium dynamics. A combination of perisomatic application of calcium ionophore and depolarizing current injection induced axonal calcium sweep and axon retraction. Thus, perisomatic environments can modulate axon behavior through long-range intracellular communication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserv},

Abstract = {Using the tube foot as a muscle and the radial nerve cord as nerve, a nerve-muscle preparation can be stimulated electrically. Thresholds are reported. It is found that supra-threshold stimulation frequency has no response correlate, but that response is roughly proportional to strength of stimulation. If sensitized by a strong shock, the effect can be maintained by weaker following shocks. "The manner of conduction of excitation from the site of electrical stimulation to the tube feet and the relationship of the intensity of stimulation and the response, indicate that the asteroid nervous system behaves more like a series of nerve tracts than a simple nerve net." 28-item bibliography.

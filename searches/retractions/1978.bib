Abstract = {Analysis of panel data from 459 families for 2 consumer packaged goods indicated that media-distributed coupons and cents-off deals induced brand switching and resulted in less loyalty when retracted than if no deal was offered. In contrast, package coupons stimulated brand loyalty which was maintained when they were retracted. The extent to which economic utility theory and self-perception theory order these findings is evaluated, and the implications of the results for managing demand are discussed.

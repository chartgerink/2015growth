Abstract = {Retracts an article by K. Ruggiero and B. Major (Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 1998, [Aug] Vol 24[8], 821-8370. The retraction is requested because questions exist concerning the validity of the data. (The following abstract of the retracted abstract originally appeared in record [rid]1998-10087-004[/rid].) Research has shown that low-status group members tend to minimize discrimination as a reason for negative feedback relative to other causes. Three experiments examined whether this tendency is limited to low-status group members or extends to high-status group members. Ss made attributions for negative feedback on a test after receiving information about the probability that they had been discriminated against by an out-group member. Exp 1 compared 60 White women and 60 White men, Exp 2 compared 45 Blacks and 45 Whites, and Exp 3 compared 120 community college student members of experimentally created low- and high-status groups (all Ss aged 18–35 yrs). All experiment},

Abstract = {Retracts an article written by K. Ruggiero, et al, (Psychological Science, 2000, [Nov] Vol. 11[6], 511-514. The first author takes responsibility for the improper exclusion of some participants who should have been included in the analyses. Had the analyses included all legitimate participants, results would have differed importantly from those reported in this article. (The following abstract of the retracted article originally appeared in record [rid]2001-14123-012[/rid].)When making explicit self-report ratings, members of status- and racial-minority groups report less personal experience with discrimination than that encountered by their group—a phenomenon called the personal/group discrimination discrepancy (PGDD). This study provides evidence, for the first time, that the PGDD may be, in part, a product of the procedure used to measure it. 15 White undergraduate women and 15 White undergraduate men completed explicit and implicit measures of personal and group discrimination bas},

Abstract = {The high-security hospitals of England and Wales are entering a phase of major retraction, with local security services embarking upon the reprovision of services for patients with longer-term needs who do not require high security. The large area mental hospitals underwent similar changes and the lessons that may be learned from this process are relevant to proposed changes in forensic services. These lessons include: (1) the risk of over-optimistic predictions concerning the time-scale and resources required for major bed reduction; (2) the problems associated with "creaming off," with the risk of increasing acuity in the residual inpatient population accompanied by deterioration in the quality of the retracting services; (3) the risk of "silting up" in the reprovided services in the absence of an appropriate community infrastructure; and (4) the importance of quality of life for longer-stay secure inpatients. This paper urges caution in view of the potentially serious clinical and },

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by D. Feifel et al (Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 2000[Dec], Vol 61[12], 909-911). The article did not explicitly mention the specific methodology used in collecting the safety and tolerability data. The authors requested that this article be retracted from the scientific literature. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2001-14316-002[/rid].) Investigated the safety and tolerability of a rapid oral-loading regimen for risperidone developed to achieve therapeutic doses of this antipsychotic within 24 hrs. Rapid-loaded risperidone was initiated with 1 mg. Subsequent doses were increased by 1 mg every 6-8 hrs up to 3 mg. Of a sample of 11 consecutive inpatients admitted to an acute psychiatric facility who were treated with this protocol, 7 tolerated the most rapid titration, achieving a standing dose of 3 mg b.i.d. in 16 hrs. Three required a slightly slower titration and achieved this target dose in 24 hrs},

Abstract = {In some cases of alleged sexual abuse, the child or adult retracts allegations made. This poses problems for both civil and criminal legal proceedings. It is argued that the collection and examination of retraction statements often does not receive the same careful attention as is the case with the investigation of the original allegations. Logically, depending on whether the original complaints were true or false or a mixture, so the meaning of a retraction may vary. Where retractions are examined and evaluated with care they may be shown to add to the confidence of the final conclusion rather than simply throwing doubt on that. A systematic approach is described, followed by 3 cases where such application assisted and paradoxically added to the probative value of earlier statements.

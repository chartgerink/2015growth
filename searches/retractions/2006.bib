Abstract = {Extinction of conditioned fear responses is an active learning process resulting from the repeated presentation of a conditioned stimulus in the absence of the unconditioned aversive stimulus. Recent research implicates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mediation of fear extinction in rodents and the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. However, there is currently little understanding of precisely how stress can impact fear extinction and the neural circuitry subserving this behavior. The present study examined the effects of brief exposure to an uncontrollable stressor on (1) fear conditioning and fear extinction, and (2) dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) regions of the mPFC in mice. Exposure to three episodes of stress ending 24 h before fear conditioning significantly attenuated the rate of cued fear extinction relative to nonstressed controls, but did not affect fear conditioning or cue or context recall.

Abstract = {Retracts one of the conclusions in the original article by Ilia et al. (American Journal of Psychiatry, 2002[Jul], Vol 159[7], 1174-1182). Since publishing this study, our laboratory at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, has had difficulty reproducing some of the findings. In particular, the primary observation that Oct-6 is ectopically expressed in schizophrenic brain tissue could not be reproduced in the Stanley series of postmortem samples. These negative findings were recently published. This failure to reproduce led us to re-examine the data underlying the original publication. The new data interpretation is outlined in this article. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2002-15165-015[/rid].) This study evaluated the expression of Oct-6 , a POU-III domain transcription factor expressed in embryonic stem cells and Schwann cells and in neuronal subpopulations during early mammalian development, in schizophrenia.

Interpersonal conflict arose in the interactions of three dyads of learners engaged in collaborative work in a foreign language classroom. Results show that although learners corrected each other's errors using recasts, in several cases the learners continued to produce the erroneous form in posttests. Stimulated recall revealed that negative feelings about their conversation partners seemed to have caused some learners to interpret recasts not as helpful corrective feedback, but as criticism and even mockery.

Abstract = {The calcium-stimulated adenylate cyclase 1 (AC1) has been shown to be required for the refinement of the retinotopic map, but the mechanisms involved are not known. To investigate this question, we devised a retinotectal coculture preparation that reproduces the gradual acquisition of topographic specificity along the rostrocaudal axis of the superior colliculus (SC). Temporal retinal axons invade the entire SC at 4 d in vitro (DIV) and eliminate exuberant branches caudally by 12 DIV. Temporal and nasal axons form branches preferentially in the rostral or caudal SC, respectively. Retinal explants from AC1-deficient mice, AC1brl/brl, maintain exuberant branches and lose the regional selectivity of branching when confronted with wild-type (WT) SC. Conversely, WT retinas correctly target AC1brl/brl collicular explants. The effects of AC1 loss of function in the retina are mimicked by the blockade of ephrin-A5 signaling in WT cocultures. Video microscopic analyses show that AC1brl/brl axo},

Abstract = {Chronic stress produces consistent and reversible changes within the dendritic arbors of CA3 hippocampal neurons, characterized by decreased dendritic length and reduced branch number. This chronic stress-induced dendritic retraction has traditionally corresponded to hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficits. However, anomalous findings have raised doubts as to whether a CA3 dendritic retraction is sufficient to compromise hippocampal function. The purpose of this review is to outline the mechanism underlying chronic stress-induced CA3 dendritic retraction and to explain why CA3 dendritic retraction has been thought to mediate spatial memory. The anomalous findings provide support for a modified hypothesis, in which chronic stress is proposed to induce CA3 dendritic retraction, which then disrupts hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, leading to dysregulated glucocorticoid release. The combination of hippocampal CA3 dendritic retraction and elevated glucocorticoid release },

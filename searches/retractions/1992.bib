Abstract = {Analyzed 2 patterns of bird distribution in subtropical South America: (1) the disjunct distribution of pairs of species and subspecies between the southern Yungas and the Paranense forests, which are separated by 700 km of xerophytic Chaco woodland, and (2) zones of secondary contact located in the Chaco lowland, where several woodland and grassland species and subspecies interact. Both bird-distribution patterns were produced by forest expansions along the Bermejo and Pilcomayo rivers that connected the southern Yungas to the Paranense region and interrupted the arid vegetation in the center of the Chaco.

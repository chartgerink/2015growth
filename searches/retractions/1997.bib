Abstract = {AP neurons in the embryonic leech CNS extend lateral projections to peripheral targets through the ganglionic nerve roots and longitudinal projections toward neighboring ganglia through the connective nerves. The lateral projections grow extensively in the periphery; in contrast, the longitudinal projections achieve relatively little growth and eventually retract, the majority having essentially disappeared by the end of embryogenesis. Cutting both nerve roots, which eliminates both lateral projections, however, induces the longitudinal projections of the AP neuron to begin to grow rapidly toward adjacent ganglia within 14 hr after the axotomy. By using a laser microbeam to cut just the lateral projections of the AP cells, we further show that it is indeed the loss of its lateral projections, and not a secondary response to the cutting of other components of the root nerves, that induces the longitudinal projections of the AP cell to grow extensively. In addition, we report that reduc},

Abstract = {Koro is a panic state associated with the thought that one's sex organ is disappearing into the body and the outcome of which is fatal. Koro is limited largely to young people of Han origin along the southern coast of China. Based on secondary data about a large-scale epidemic in southern China that lasted from August, 1984 to June, 1985, this paper examines how environmental and personal risk factors operate in a dynamic way to determine the way koro is manifested in Chinese people. Environmental risk factors include cultural attitudes and beliefs, news or rumors about koro, and an anxious neighborhood. Individual risk factors include education, age, and marital status. Koro in China is best conceived as a social malady supported by cultural myths that tend to affect young people who are deprived of proper sex information to explain their physical development.

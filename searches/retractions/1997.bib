Abstract = {Koro is a panic state associated with the thought that one's sex organ is disappearing into the body and the outcome of which is fatal. Koro is limited largely to young people of Han origin along the southern coast of China. Based on secondary data about a large-scale epidemic in southern China that lasted from August, 1984 to June, 1985, this paper examines how environmental and personal risk factors operate in a dynamic way to determine the way koro is manifested in Chinese people. Environmental risk factors include cultural attitudes and beliefs, news or rumors about koro, and an anxious neighborhood. Individual risk factors include education, age, and marital status. Koro in China is best conceived as a social malady supported by cultural myths that tend to affect young people who are deprived of proper sex information to explain their physical development.

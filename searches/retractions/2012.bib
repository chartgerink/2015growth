Abstract = {The effects and mechanism of action of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing CpG motif (CpG-ODNs) on neuron cells are largely unexamined. Here, we found that CpG-A ODNs but not other types of CpG-ODNs induced neurite retraction and cell apoptosis of rat embryonic neurons in a TLR9-independent manner. These effects of CpG-A ODNs were primarily due to the poly-guanosine at the 3′ terminus (3′G-ODNs). Pull-down analysis showed that 3′G-ODNs associated with transcription factor Y-BOX1 (YB-1) to facilitate the translocation of YB-1 into the nucleus via the nuclear localizing sequence of YB-1. YB-1 then interacted with the promoter of F-spondin directly at −45 and −1,375 sites as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Binding of YB-1 to F-spondin promoter resulted in downregulation of F-spondin expression. Overexpression of F-spondin rescued the cell death and neurite retraction induced by 3′G-ODNs in embryonic neuron cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that},

Abstract = {Eye movements depend on correct patterns of connectivity between cranial motor axons and the extraocular muscles. Despite the clinical importance of the ocular motor system, little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying its development. We have recently shown that mutations in the Chimaerin-1 gene encoding the signaling protein α2-chimaerin (α2-chn) perturb axon guidance in the ocular motor system and lead to the human eye movement disorder, Duane retraction syndrome (DRS). The axon guidance cues that lie upstream of α2-chn are unknown; here we identify candidates to be the Semaphorins (Sema) 3A and 3C, acting via the PlexinA receptors. Sema3A/C are expressed in and around the developing extraocular muscles and cause growth cone collapse of oculomotor neurons in vitro. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of α2-chn or PlexinAs in oculomotor neurons abrogates Sema3A/C-dependent growth cone collapse. In vivo knockdown of endogenous PlexinAs or α2-chn function results in stereotypical oc},

Abstract = {The objective of this editorial is discusses retraction which occurs in biomedical journals. Bioethics has never had to retract any of its peer reviewed content due to plagiarism or any other form of academic misconduct. Like many other journals, we might get caught out having published – unbeknownst to us – plagiarized content, for instance. There has been quite a bit of discussion of what the responsibilities of journal editors are in terms of ensuring that they don't publish plagiarized content. Truth be told, our options are limited, simply due to the resource constraints we work under in terms of running a larger humanities journal that publishes frequently. From 2012 onwards we will subject accepted manuscripts randomly to in-depth content investigations in order to deter plagiarists from submitting to us. Hopefully that will permit us to maintain our as yet unblemished record. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Retraction, i.e., when a speaker returns to an earlier point within an unfolding grammatical structure, is a common resource used by both German and Swedish speakers when completing such actions as substituting, deleting, inserting, or repeating parts of an utterance. However, this resource is not necessarily used in the same ways in German and Swedish. Typological differences in the languages, such as word order and morphosyntactic characteristics, can affect the pattern of retraction (cf. Fox et al., 2009a, 2010).

Objective: To explore hypotheses that more patients are put at risk if a retracted paper appears in a journal with a high impact factor (IF) so that the paper is widely read; is written by a ‘repeat offender’ author who has produced other retracted research; or is a clinical trial. Methods: English language papers (n = 788) retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Only those papers retracting research with humans or freshly derived human material were included; 180 retracted primary papers (22.8%) met inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated were tallied, both in the retracted primary studies and in 851 secondary studies that cited a retracted primary paper.

Abstract = {When neurons exit the cell cycle after their terminal mitosis, they detach from the apical surface of the neuroepithelium. Despite the fact that this detachment is crucial for further neurogenesis and neuronal migration, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Here, taking advantage of the genetics and imaging possibilities of the zebrafish retina as a model system, we show by knockdown experiments that the guidance molecule Slit1b and its receptor Robo3 are required for apical retraction of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In contrast, N-cadherin seems to be responsible for maintenance of apical attachment, as expression of dominant-negative N-cadherin causes RGCs to lose apical attachments prematurely and rescues retraction in slit1b morphants. These results suggest that Slit-Robo signaling downregulates N-cadherin activity to allow apical retraction in newly generated RGCs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: During development, excess synapses form between the central and peripheral nervous systems that are then eliminated to achieve correct connectivity. In the peripheral auditory system, the developing type I spiral ganglion afferent fibres undergo a dramatic re-organisation, initially forming connections with both sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). The OHC connections are then selectively eliminated, leaving sparse innervation by type II afferent fibres, whilst the type I afferent synapses with IHCs are consolidated. Results: We examined the molecular makeup of the synaptic contacts formed onto the IHCs and OHCs during this period of afferent fibre remodelling. We observed that presynaptic ribbons initially form at all the afferent neurite contacts, i.e. not only at the expected developing IHC-type I fibre synapses but also at OHCs where type I fibres temporarily contact. Moreover, the transient contacts forming onto OHCs possess a broad set of pre},

Abstract = {Reports the retraction of "The impact of accumulating and reactivating technological experience on R&D alliance performance" by Holger Ernst, Ulrich Lichtenthaler and Carsten Vogt (Journal of Management Studies, 2011[Sep], Vol 48[6], 1194-1216). The article is retracted due to errors in the reported empirical results, which form part of the basis for the conclusions drawn by the authors in the study. While the second author did not collect the data, he takes the responsibility for these technical errors. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-16140-003[/rid]). Drawing on organizational learning theory, we distinguish the entrepreneurial processes of experience accumulation (i.e. gaining technological experience), and experience reactivation (i.e. leveraging the accumulated experience), as two essential stages of knowledge retention. While controlling for alliance experience, we further use new data of 196 biopharmaceutical R&D alliances to examine},

Abstract = {The chick embryo (Gallus domesticus) is one of the most important model systems in vertebrate developmental biology. The development and function of its auditory brainstem circuitry is exceptionally well studied. These circuits represent an excellent system for genetic manipulation to investigate mechanisms controlling neural circuit formation, synaptogenesis, neuronal polarity, and dendritic arborization. The present study investigates the auditory nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM). The neurotrophin receptor TrkB regulates dendritic structure in CNS neurons. TrkB is expressed in NM neurons at E7–E8 when these neurons have dendritic arbors. Downregulation of TrkB occurs after E8 followed by retraction of dendrites and by E18 most NM cells are adendritic. Is cessation of TrkB expression in NM necessary for dendritic retraction? To answer this question we combined focal in ovo electroporation with transposon mediated gene transfer to obtain stable expression of Doxycycline (Dox) reg},

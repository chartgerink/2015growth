Abstract = {A simple model of correlation-based synaptic plasticity via axonal sprouting and retraction (T. Elliott, C. I. Howarth, & N. R. Shadbolt, 1996a) is shown to be equivalent to the class of correlation-based models (K. D. Miller, J. B. Keller, & M. P. Stryker, 1989), although these were formulated in terms of weight modification of anatomically fixed synapses. Both models maximize the same measure of synaptic correlation, subject to constraints on connectivity. Thus, the analyses of the correlation-based models suffice to characterize the behavior of the sprouting-and-retraction model. More detailed models are needed for theoretical distinctions to be drawn between plasticity via sprouting and retraction or weight modification. The model of Elliott et al involves stochastic search through allowed weight patterns for those that improve correlations. That of Miller et al follows dynamical equations that determine continuous changes of the weights that improve correlations. The identity of },

Abstract = {Koro is a culture-specific psychiatric disorder occurring primarily in Southeast Asian cultures. It is manifested by acute anxiety associated with the fear of genital retraction, accompanied by fear of death induced by the thought that complete disappearance of the genital organ will result in death. Koro has been described in non-Asian patients as well, leading to a debate concerning the culture-specific nature of the syndrome. Giving a psychopathological, nosological definition of this peculiar syndrome is also problematic. In this paper, the authors report a case of koro in a 29 yr old Korean female patient brought to their clinic because she had been running naked along a highway at night. She presented with anxiety, fear of impending death, and psychomotor restlessness. She was given droperidolum, and by the following morning, her behavior was composed, coordinated, and her anxiety had disappeared, and she was discharged. Etiological factors related to the development of the synd},

Abstract = {Koro is a culture-specific psychiatric disorder occurring primarily in southeast Asia. Its cardinal feature is an acute anxiety associated with the fear of genital retraction, accompanied by fear of death induced by a belief that complete disappearance of the genital organ will result in death. Koro has been described in non-Asian patients as well, leading to debate about the culture-specific nature of the syndrome. Giving a psychopathologic, a nosologic definition of koro is also problematic, reflected by the fact that the term "genital retraction syndrome" has become preferable. The authors briefly survey the literature on this syndrome, and report on two cases, one involving a 29-yr-old South Korean woman and one involving a 35-yr-old male patient with a history of paranoid schizophrenia.

Abstract = {Data for the analysis was provided from 235 retracted articles found via a MEDLINE search. Articles were classified according to the following characteristics: who retracted the publication; what content was retracted; why the article (or portion of the article) was retracted; and how long after publication the retraction occurred. To determine citing activity, Science Citation Index was searched to identify all citations to each of the retracted publications. This study focused on postretraction citations indexed in the Abridged Index Medicus. One or more of the authors retracted 190 articles; 45 were retracted by others, including institutional investigating committees or deans, journal editors, or legal counsels. Retraction of 91 articles occurred because of some kind of error. A total of 86 articles were retracted because of misconduct or presumed misconduct. An additional 38 articles were retracted because the author(s) could not replicate the results. (PsycINFO Database Record (},

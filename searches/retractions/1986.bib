Abstract = {Presents the case of a 44-yr-old male, diagnosed as having major depression with melancholia, who suffered painful postcoital testicular retraction following treatment with desipramine (25–250 mg/day), an effect possibly related to previous inguinal hernia.

Abstract = {Presents experiments demonstrating that standard methods for monitoring eye movement fail to register significant components of eye position that are slowly changing during the aftermath of the rapid motion. Results imply that the full duration of a saccade is longer than has been previously suspected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Discusses subtractive processes in early brain damage in human infants as described in the experimental literature and explores their potential role in alterations of brain organization. The following areas are addressed: factors (developing spinal cord and spinal ganglia) controlling early neuron loss, neuron loss in brainstem and forebrain during early development, and sequelae of perinatal brain injury (including language loss and recovery).

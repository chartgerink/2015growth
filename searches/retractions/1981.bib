Abstract = {With the support of expert opinions presented in 2 cases from his medical and legal practice, the present author examines the motives behind retracted confessions of individuals held for trial on criminal charges. It is suggested that some confessions are false due to psychiatric problems that, if detected in time, can prove the innocence of a person before trial. External pressures may lead to some retractions, but most interesting are those of innocents and their motives for confessing to a crime that did not take place. Numerous quotations from various authors elaborate on this aspect. Particular attention is focused on the necessity of conducting police interrogations prudently; in France they are limited to 48 hrs. In this context, sleep deprivation has a particularly injurious impact on efforts to acquire accurate information from suspects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

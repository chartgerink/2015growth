Abstract = {The development of dendritic spines is thought to be crucial for synaptic plasticity. Dendritic spines are retracted upon Eph receptor A4 (EphA4) activation, but the mechanisms that control this process are not well understood. Here we report an important function of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in EphA4-dependent spine retraction in mice. We found that blocking Cdk5 activity inhibits ephrin-A1-triggered spine retraction and reduction of mEPSC frequency at hippocampal synapses. The activation of EphA4 resulted in the recruitment of Cdk5 to EphA4, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Cdk5. EphA4 and Cdk5 then enhanced the activation of ephexin1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that regulates activation of the small Rho GTPase RhoA. The association between EphA4 and ephexin1 was significantly reduced in Cdk5-/- brains and Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of ephexin1 was required for the ephrin-A1-mediated regulation of spine density. These findings suggest th},

Abstract = {We previously found that chronic stress conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction and spatial memory deficits make the hippocampus vulnerable to the neurotoxin ibotenic acid (IBO). The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to chronic corticosterone (CORT) under conditions that produce CA3 dendritic retraction would enhance CA3 susceptibility to IBO. Male Sprague Dawley rats were chronically treated for 21 d with CORT in drinking water (400 μg/ml), and half were given daily injections of phenytoin (40 mg/kg), an antiepileptic drug that prevents CA3 dendritic retraction. Three days after treatments stopped, IBO was infused into the CA3 region. Conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction (CORT and vehicle) exacerbated IBO-induced CA3 damage compared with conditions in which CA3 dendritic retraction was not observed (vehicle and vehicle, vehicle and phenytoin, CORT and phenytoin). Additionally, spatial recognition memory was assessed using the Y-maze, revealing tha},

Abstract = {Axons in the CNS do not regrow after injury, whereas lesioned axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) regenerate. Lesioned CNS axons form characteristic swellings at their tips known as retraction bulbs, which are the nongrowing counterparts of growth cones. Although much progress has been made in identifying intracellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate growth cone locomotion and axonal elongation, a comprehensive understanding of how retraction bulbs form and why they are unable to grow is still elusive. Here we report the analysis of the morphological and intracellular responses of injured axons in the CNS compared with those in the PNS. We show that retraction bulbs of injured CNS axons increase in size over time, whereas growth cones of injured PNS axons remain constant. Retraction bulbs contain a disorganized microtubule network, whereas growth cones possess the typical bundling of microtubules. Using in vivo imaging, we find that pharmacological disruption of microt},

Abstract = {As a cultural-bound syndrome, koro is described in the DSM-IV as "an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in females, the vulva and the nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death." Sometimes the syndrome may occur as an epidemic involving several hundreds to thousands of subjects within a short period of time. While the syndrome individually involves an anxiety reaction and fear of mortal genital retraction, it collectively takes the form of epidemics and mass panic. Recently a consensus has been reached about the fact that genital retraction is intimately related not only with ethno-cultural beliefs but also with the dramatic expression of acute anxiety and fear of impending catastrophe or death. We present two cases of koro syndrome who experienced severe anxiety due to the feeling of genital retraction and thus we question the cultural specifity of fears of genital retraction.

Increases in conditioned responding to a target stimulus achieved through posttraining extinction of a former companion stimulus (deflation) have proven moderately easy to obtain. In contrast, reductions in responding to a target as a result of posttraining pairings of its companion with the outcome (inflation) have proven more elusive. It has been suggested that stimuli with high biological significance (i.e., high response potential) are partially protected against inflation-mediated reductions in responding.

The authors recently discovered that there were errors in the data that were reported in the original article. Specifically, 37 cases were accidentally duplicated across the two samples used in the cross-validation analyses conducted in this study. The duplication occurred as a result of merging two databases with overlapping data to form the samples used in the study in question. While reanalysis of corrected data did not change the pattern of results, the authors wish to withdraw the paper from the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. The authors have undertaken an independent audit of their entire database to ensure that the same or similar errors (or any other errors) do no},

Clay (Journal of Neurophysiology, 2013[Dec][1], Vol 110[11], 2574-2579). Equation 5 in this report contains an incorrect valence, z = 1, for Ca2+ instead of the correct valence, z = 2.

Abstract = {Background. Neurorehabilitation protocols based on the use of robotic devices have recently shown to provide promising clinical results. However, their efficacy is still limited because of the poor comprehension of the mechanisms at the basis of functional enhancements. Objective. To increase basic understanding of robot-mediated neurorehabilitation by performing experiments on a rodent model of stroke. Methods. Mice were trained to pull back a handle on a robotic platform and their performances in the task were evaluated before and after a focal cortical ischemic stroke. The platform was designed for the quantitative assessment of forelimb function via a series of parameters (time needed to complete the task, t-target; average force; number of sub-movements). Results. The animals rapidly learned the retraction task and reached asymptotic performance by the fifth session of training. Within 2 to 6 days after a small, endothelin-1-induced lesion in the caudal forelimb area, mice showed},

Infants with abduction deficit should be considered to have Duane retraction syndrome until disproven, because congenital abducens nerve palsy is extremely rare. The abducens nerve on the affected side is absent in type 1 Duane retraction syndrome and in some type 3 patients. The authors present a 7-month-old girl who showed limitation of abduction simulating Duane retraction syndrome. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophic lateral rectus and present abducens nerve. This report is important because this case showed that congenital abducens nerve palsy exists, although it is extremely rare, and high-resolution MRI could be pivotal for the differentiation of Duane retraction syndrome and congenital abducens nerve palsy in infancy.

Abstract = {Parkinson’s disease has long been described to be a product of dopamine and (or) melanin loss in the substanstia nigra (SN). Although most studies have focused on dopaminergic neurons, it is important to consider the role of pigment cells in the etiology of the disease and to create an in vitro live cell model for studies involving pigmented adrenergic cells of the SN in Parkinsonism. The Melanocytes share specific features with the pigmented adrenergic neurons as both cells are pigmented, contain adrenergic receptors and have cellular processes. Although the melanocyte cellular processes are relatively short and observable only when stimulated appropriately by epinephrine and other factors or molecules.

This article has been retracted due to unattributed overlap with material from other sources and due to duplicate publication.

Therefore, regulation of intestinal microflora composition by probiotics offers the possibility to influence the development of autoimmune/atopic diseases. And probiotics have been reported as capable preventive and therapeutic strategy in all},

The current research proposed that the self-sufficient motivation induced by money reminders causes consumers to perceive social influences as threats to their autonomy.

Reinforcement from engaging in health behaviors is often delayed by several months or years, a circumstance partly responsible for some people’s increased preference for engaging in unhealthy behaviors associated with immediate reinforcement.

From the ancient times, there are three basic approaches for the interpretation of the different psychic phenomena: the organic, the psychological, and the sacred approach. The sacred approach forms the primordial foundation for any psychopathological development, innate to the prelogical human mind. Until the second millennium B.C., the Great Mother ruled the Universe and shamans cured the different mental disorders.

Abstract = {Genetic evidence suggests cell-type–specific functions for certain nucleoporins, and gene expression profiling has revealed that nucleoporin p62 (NUP62) transcripts are decreased in the prefrontal cortex of major depressives. Chronic stress, which can precipitate depression, induces changes in the architecture and plasticity of apical dendrites that are particularly evident in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Genetically targeted translating ribosome affinity purification revealed a selective reduction in translated Nup62 transcripts in CA3 of chronically stressed mice, and the Nup62 protein content of nuclei extracted from whole hippocampus was found to be decreased in chronically stressed rats. In cultured cells, phosphorylation of a FAK/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) consensus site in the alpha-helical domain of NUP62 (human Y422) is shown to be associated with shedding of NUP62 from the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and/or retention of NUP62 in the cytoplasm. Increased level},

This study examines how advertisements containing thin or heavy models influence the self-esteem of overweight, normal, and underweight consumers.

Abstract = {Background: Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital ocular motility disorder characterized by limited abduction and/or limited adduction, globe retraction, and narrowing of the palpebral fissure on adduction. Because of adduction limits, these patients may also exhibit convergence insufficiency (CI). Symptomatic individuals can often benefit from optometric vision therapy (OVT). Although OVT does not treat the DRS itself, these procedural interventions can alleviate symptoms by improving vergence and accommodative ability. Case: A 10-year-old girl was referred for complaints of asthenopia at near and intermittent horizontal diplopia on side gaze. She exhibited signs of intermittent alternating exotropia at near and poor pursuit eye movements. A visual skills evaluation revealed DRS and CI; with the latter being managed successfully with OVT. Symptoms were relieved entirely with a relatively short course of therapy for the CI, despite the presence of adduction limitations due t},

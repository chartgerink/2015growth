Abstract = {Investigated how in-store price promotions affect market share after the promotions have been retracted. Ss were 129 university students (Exp 1), 54 undergraduates (Exp 2), and 43 female undergraduates (Exp 3). The effects of promotion were contingent on both the choice patterns of Ss (whether or not Ss switched among brands) and the ubiquity of promotions in a product category. If only one brand was being promoted and Ss were generally loyal to the last brand purchased, brand choice probability declined from prepromotion levels once the promotion was withdrawn. However, if Ss tended to switch among brands in the absence of promotions, or if several brands were being promoted, this decline was mitigated and/or did not occur.

Abstract = {Reports a case of complete Koro complex in a 73-yr-old male suffering from psychotic depression following a nondominant temporoparietal stroke. Koro is comprised of beliefs that (1) the genitals are shrinking, (2) they will disappear into the abdomen, and (3) that this process will result in death. Koro lacks diagnostic and cultural specificity and should be renamed the genital retraction syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Findings concerning the effectiveness of stimuli from various conditioning procedures in blocking conditioned excitation and occasion-setting functions of an added stimulus in a serial feature-positive discrimination training procedure (V. M. LoLordo and R. T. Ross; see record [rid]1987-24106-001[/rid]; Ross and LoLordo; see record [rid]1987-14728-001[/rid]) are retracted. Videotapes on which the published data were based were rescored by 2â€“5 people, most of whom were uninformed about group memberships of the Subjects. In no case did the rescoring confirm any of the original findings of blocking. Possible factors contributing to the discrepancies are discussed. The experiments should be repeated with feature stimuli that are less similar to each other and with several scorers, at least one of whom is unaware of the group assignment of the Subjects.

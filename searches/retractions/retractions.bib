Abstract = {The effect of the potent soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1H outgrowth and triggered -[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) on neurite outgrowth and retraction was investigated in PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. ODQ inhibited neuriteneurite retraction in the cells stimulated with nerve growth factor (NGF), staurosporine, or Y-27632. The nitric oxide (NO) scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) had little effect on neurite outgrowth induced by Y-27632 or staurosporine. In the presence of ODQ, treatment of the cells with the cell-permeable cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP failed to retrigger Y-27632- and staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, the depletion of sGC by RNA interference failed to prevent Y-27632- and staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that the NO/sGC/cGMP signaling cascade is not critically involved in ODQ-induced neurite remodeling. The MEK inhibitor PD98059},

Abstract = {The effects and mechanism of action of oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing CpG motif (CpG-ODNs) on neuron cells are largely unexamined. Here, we found that CpG-A ODNs but not other types of CpG-ODNs induced neurite retraction and cell apoptosis of rat embryonic neurons in a TLR9-independent manner. These effects of CpG-A ODNs were primarily due to the poly-guanosine at the 3′ terminus (3′G-ODNs). Pull-down analysis showed that 3′G-ODNs associated with transcription factor Y-BOX1 (YB-1) to facilitate the translocation of YB-1 into the nucleus via the nuclear localizing sequence of YB-1. YB-1 then interacted with the promoter of F-spondin directly at −45 and −1,375 sites as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Binding of YB-1 to F-spondin promoter resulted in downregulation of F-spondin expression. Overexpression of F-spondin rescued the cell death and neurite retraction induced by 3′G-ODNs in embryonic neuron cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that},

Abstract = {Investigated the production of lower lip retraction (LLR) in male rats by the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and the effect of the putative 5-HT1A antagonists pindolol and (1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)-butyl])-piperazine (NAN190). 8-OH-DPAT (0.125–2.0 mg/kg) caused a dose-related increase in LLR. Pindolol (10–40 mg/kg) and NAN190 (2.5–20 mg/kg) produced a dose-related block of 8-OH-DPAT-induced LLR. When administered alone, pindolol also caused LLR, thus suggesting that pindolol behaves as a partial agonist in this model. This was not the case with NAN190, which failed to produce LLR; however, NAN190 produced a dose-related block of the pindolol-induced LLR. Thus, the LLR model can be used to detect 5-HT1A agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

To increase basic understanding of robot-mediated neurorehabilitation by performing experiments on a rodent model of stroke. Methods. Mice were trained to pull back a handle on a robotic platform and their performances in the task were evaluated before and after a focal cortical ischemic stroke. The platform was designed for the quantitative assessment of forelimb function via a series of parameters (time needed to complete the task, t-target; average force; number of sub-movements). Results. The animals rapidly learned the retraction task and reached asymptotic performance by the fifth session of training.

Abstract = {Cell motility drives many biological processes, including immune responses and embryonic development. In the brain, microglia are immune cells that survey and scavenge brain tissue using elaborate and motile cell processes. The motility of these processes is guided by the local release of chemoattractants. However, most microglial processes retract during prolonged brain injury or disease. This hallmark of brain inflammation remains unexplained. We identified a molecular pathway in mouse and human microglia that converted ATP-driven process extension into process retraction during inflammation. This chemotactic reversal was driven by upregulation of the A2A adenosine receptor coincident with P2Y₁₂ downregulation. Thus, A2A receptor stimulation by adenosine, a breakdown product of extracellular ATP, caused activated microglia to assume their characteristic amoeboid morphology during brain inflammation. Our results indicate that purine nucleotides provide an opportunity for contextdepen},

Macrophage infiltration correlates spatiotemporally with this deleterious phenomenon, but the direct involvement of these inflammatory cells has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we examined the role of macrophages in axonal retraction within the dorsal columns after spinal cord injury in vivo and found that retraction occurred between days 2 and 28 after lesion and that the ends of injured axons were associated with ED-1+ cells. Clodronate liposome-mediated depletion of infiltrating macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in axonal retraction; however, we saw no evidence of regeneration. We used time-lapse imaging of adult dorsal root ganglion neurons in an in vitro model of the glial scar to examine macrophage-axon interactions and observed that adhesive contacts and considerable physical interplay between macrophages and dystrophic axons led to ext},

Abstract = {Eye movements depend on correct patterns of connectivity between cranial motor axons and the extraocular muscles. Despite the clinical importance of the ocular motor system, little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying its development. We have recently shown that mutations in the Chimaerin-1 gene encoding the signaling protein α2-chimaerin (α2-chn) perturb axon guidance in the ocular motor system and lead to the human eye movement disorder, Duane retraction syndrome (DRS). The axon guidance cues that lie upstream of α2-chn are unknown; here we identify candidates to be the Semaphorins (Sema) 3A and 3C, acting via the PlexinA receptors. Sema3A/C are expressed in and around the developing extraocular muscles and cause growth cone collapse of oculomotor neurons in vitro. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of α2-chn or PlexinAs in oculomotor neurons abrogates Sema3A/C-dependent growth cone collapse. In vivo knockdown of endogenous PlexinAs or α2-chn function results in stereotypical oc},

Abstract = {Disconjugate oculomotor adaptation is driven by the need to maintain binocular vision. Since binocular vision in Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) patients is normal in half of their horizontal field of gaze (i.e., sound-side of gaze), we wondered whether oculomotor adaptive capabilities are efficient despite such a severe impairment of eye motility towards the other half of the horizontal field of gaze (i.e., affected-side gaze). We compared properties of horizontal saccades of patients with congenital unilateral Duane Retraction Syndrome type I in binocular viewing and monocular viewing conditions by simultaneously recording both eyes with the search coil technique. Our results show a mismatch between the pulse and the step signal of the innervation for saccades. When tested in the affected eye viewing condition (sound eye covered), the eyes showed not only similarly-directed increases of the saccadic gain (pulse signal) in the two eyes but also disjunctive post-saccadic drifts (step },

These contractions are most pronounced in the situations of cold, stress, and upon exercising, and can be the source of embarrassment to those who have a hyperactive retraction reflex, especially when exposed to their partners or to others in showers and dressing rooms, despite a normal and satisfactory length in the erect state. Aim. In this work, we propose an alternative to surgery and penile extenders for alleviating penile retraction, by injection of botulinum toxin into the dartos to induce muscle relaxation. This is the first report of the technique. Methods. Ten male patients complaining of a short penis exclusively in the flaccid state, despite normal and satisfactory erect and outstretched lengths, were selected for the study. One hundred units of BOTOX were injected into the dartos muscle. Main Outcome Measures. Frequency and amplitude of penile retraction, flaccid unstretched length},

Recent research implicates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mediation of fear extinction in rodents and the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. However, there is currently little understanding of precisely how stress can impact fear extinction and the neural circuitry subserving this behavior.

Abstract = {The development of dendritic spines is thought to be crucial for synaptic plasticity. Dendritic spines are retracted upon Eph receptor A4 (EphA4) activation, but the mechanisms that control this process are not well understood. Here we report an important function of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in EphA4-dependent spine retraction in mice. We found that blocking Cdk5 activity inhibits ephrin-A1-triggered spine retraction and reduction of mEPSC frequency at hippocampal synapses. The activation of EphA4 resulted in the recruitment of Cdk5 to EphA4, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Cdk5. EphA4 and Cdk5 then enhanced the activation of ephexin1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that regulates activation of the small Rho GTPase RhoA. The association between EphA4 and ephexin1 was significantly reduced in Cdk5-/- brains and Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of ephexin1 was required for the ephrin-A1-mediated regulation of spine density. These findings suggest th},

Abstract = {Chronic stress may have different effects on hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neuronal morphology and function depending upon hormonal status, but rarely are manipulations of stress and gonadal steroids combined. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of chronic restraint and 17β-estradiol replacement on CA3 and CA1 dendritic morphology and spatial learning in ovariectomized (OVX) female Sprague-Dawley rats. OVX rats were implanted with 25% 17β-estradiol, 100% cholesterol, or blank silastic capsules and then chronically restrained (6h/d/21d) or kept in home cages. 17β-Estradiol or cholesterol prevented stress-induced CA3 dendritic retraction, increased CA1 apical spine density, and altered CA1 spine shape. The combination of chronic stress and 17β-estradiol facilitated water maze acquisition compared to chronic stress + blank implants and nonstressed controls + 17β-estradiol. To further investigate the interaction between 17β-estradiol and stress on hippocampal morphology, experiment 2 was cond},

Abstract = {We previously found that chronic stress conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction and spatial memory deficits make the hippocampus vulnerable to the neurotoxin ibotenic acid (IBO). The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to chronic corticosterone (CORT) under conditions that produce CA3 dendritic retraction would enhance CA3 susceptibility to IBO. Male Sprague Dawley rats were chronically treated for 21 d with CORT in drinking water (400 μg/ml), and half were given daily injections of phenytoin (40 mg/kg), an antiepileptic drug that prevents CA3 dendritic retraction. Three days after treatments stopped, IBO was infused into the CA3 region. Conditions producing CA3 dendritic retraction (CORT and vehicle) exacerbated IBO-induced CA3 damage compared with conditions in which CA3 dendritic retraction was not observed (vehicle and vehicle, vehicle and phenytoin, CORT and phenytoin). Additionally, spatial recognition memory was assessed using the Y-maze, revealing tha},

Abstract = {The pathological mechanism of convergence retraction nystagmus (CRN) is not known. To determine whether CRN is a disorder of vergence or of the saccadic system, the scleral search coil technique was used to record binocularly the three-dimensional components of CRN in a 62-yr-old male patient with a left mesencephalic infarction involving the nucleus of the posterior commissurc and the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle. CRN had disconjugate horizontal and torsional components. The horizontal amplitude/velocity relationship of CRN aligned with the main sequence of vergence responses of normal control subjects but not with that of saccades. Vergence responses of the right eye and left eye were not asynchronous. The slow phases of CRN showed an exponential decay with a time constant of 70 milliseconds. Thus, CRN is probably a disorder of vergence rather than of opposing adducting saccades. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Information that is presumed to be true at encoding but later on turns out to be false (i.e., misinformation) often continues to influence memory and reasoning. In the present study, we investigated how the strength of encoding and the strength of a later retraction of the misinformation affect this continued influence effect. Participants read an event report containing misinformation and a subsequent correction. Encoding strength of the misinformation and correction were orthogonally manipulated either via repetition (Experiment 1) or by imposing a cognitive load during reading (Experiment 2). Results suggest that stronger retractions are effective in reducing the continued influence effects associated with strong misinformation encoding, but that even strong retractions fail to eliminate continued influence effects associated with relatively weak encoding. We present a simple computational model based on random sampling that captures this effect pattern, and conclude that the conti},

Abstract = {Monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period reduces the visual cortical response to the deprived eye and causes the geniculocortical axons serving the deprived eye to retract. When MD is combined with a pharmacological inhibition of the visual cortex, the cortical neurons weaken their response to an open eye and the input axons serving the open eye retract. To determine whether the 2 types of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity reflect an experiencedriven modification of neural circuits sharing the same developmental time course, we analyzed the OD plasticity in an inhibited visual cortex using cats at different ages. MD did not affect the OD distribution in the inhibited cortex of adults, confirming that the OD plasticity in the inhibited cortex represents a developmental plasticity. In developing animals, the OD plasticity in the inhibited cortex was observed at the late phase of the critical period (P40–46) but not at the early phase (P22–26). We found a retraction of input },

Generally, the responses in flexor and extensor muscles acting at the shoulder or elbow were bilaterally coordinated according to a negative feedback scheme. Perturbations in the direction of the movements that would have taken place if the animal had not been paralyzed tended to shorten the duration of the burst of activity of the muscles active during that phase and vice versa in the opposite phase. Changes in response patterns took place around critical points corresponding to the critical points B-D described in the companion paper using tonic perturbations of the limb.

Abstract = {The present article reviews the syndrome of genital retraction (SGR) from the perspective of transcultural psychiatry. It is best known as a culture-bound syndrome in Asia, e.g. koro in Indonesia or suo yang in Southern China, where it can be also observed in so-called epidemics. The syndrome is characterised by the sensation that the genitals are shrinking and being pulled back into the abdomen; this perception is associated with fear of death, because the subjects expect to die as soon as the genital has disappeared completely. Particularly in the case of suo yang, the involvement of local traditional concepts of illness can be established. In the Western world, however, SGR is observed only in single cases. The symptoms are less dramatic and do not show a particular cultural context. This form of SGR is called "koro-like" (koro-like symptoms, KLS). In contrast to the Asian form, KLS are not observed in healthy subjects, but as an unspecific syndrome related to other neuropsychiatri},

Abstract = {Axons in the CNS do not regrow after injury, whereas lesioned axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) regenerate. Lesioned CNS axons form characteristic swellings at their tips known as retraction bulbs, which are the nongrowing counterparts of growth cones. Although much progress has been made in identifying intracellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate growth cone locomotion and axonal elongation, a comprehensive understanding of how retraction bulbs form and why they are unable to grow is still elusive. Here we report the analysis of the morphological and intracellular responses of injured axons in the CNS compared with those in the PNS. We show that retraction bulbs of injured CNS axons increase in size over time, whereas growth cones of injured PNS axons remain constant. Retraction bulbs contain a disorganized microtubule network, whereas growth cones possess the typical bundling of microtubules. Using in vivo imaging, we find that pharmacological disruption of microt},

Abstract = {Duane retraction syndrome consists of abduction deficit and palpebral fissure narrowing, upshoots, or downshoots on adduction. Infants with abduction deficit should be considered to have Duane retraction syndrome until disproven, because congenital abducens nerve palsy is extremely rare. The abducens nerve on the affected side is absent in type 1 Duane retraction syndrome and in some type 3 patients. The authors present a 7-month-old girl who showed limitation of abduction simulating Duane retraction syndrome. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophic lateral rectus and present abducens nerve. This report is important because this case showed that congenital abducens nerve palsy exists, although it is extremely rare, and high-resolution MRI could be pivotal for the differentiation of Duane retraction syndrome and congenital abducens nerve palsy in infancy.

Rats eating high fat chow gained more body weight than rats eating standard chow and, after 6 weeks of eating high fat chow, they were more sensitive to 8-OH-DPAT (0.01–0.1 mg/kg)-induced lower lip retraction and quinpirole (0.0032–0.32 mg/kg)-induced yawning.

Bioethics has never had to retract any of its peer reviewed content due to plagiarism or any other form of academic misconduct. Like many other journals, we might get caught out having published – unbeknownst to us – plagiarized content, for instance. There has been quite a bit of discussion of what the responsibilities of journal editors are in terms of ensuring that they don't publish plagiarized content. Truth be told, our options are limited, simply due to the resource constraints we work under in terms of running a larger humanities journal that publishes frequently. From 2012 onwards we will subject accepted manuscripts randomly to in-depth content investigations in order to deter plagiarists from submitting to us. Hopefully that will permit us to maintain our as yet unblemished record. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

If only one brand was being promoted and Ss were generally loyal to the last brand purchased, brand choice probability declined from prepromotion levels once the promotion was withdrawn. However, if Ss tended to switch among brands in the absence of promotions, or if several brands were being promoted, this decline was mitigated and/or did not occur.

Abstract = {Throughout the nervous system, neurons restrict their connections to specific depths or "layers" of their targets to constrain the type and number of synapses they make. Despite the importance of lamina-specific synaptic connectivity, the mechanisms that give rise to this feature in mammals remain poorly understood. Here we examined the cellular events underlying the formation of lamina-specific retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axonal projections to the superior colliculus (SC) of the mouse. By combining a genetically encoded marker of a defined RGC subtype (OFF-αRGCs) with serial immunoelectron microscopy, we resolved the ultrastructure of axon terminals fated for laminar stabilization versus those fated for removal. We found that OFF-αRGCs form synapses across the full depth of the retinorecipient SC before undergoing lamina-specific arbor retraction and synapse elimination to arrive at their mature, restricted pattern of connectivity. Interestingly, we did not observe evidence of axon d},

The most commonly cited reason for retraction was research error or inability to reproduce results; the rate from research misconduct is an underestimate, since some retractions necessitated by research misconduct were reported as being due to inability to reproduce. Retraction by parties other than authors is increasing, especially for research misconduct. Although retractions are on average occurring sooner after publication than in the past, citation analysis shows that they are not being recognised by subsequent users of the work. Findings suggest that editors and institutional officials are taking more responsibility for correcting the scientific record but that reasons published in the retraction notice are not always reliable.

Abstract = {The circuit for binocular vision and stereopsis is established at the optic chiasm, where retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons diverge into the ipsilateral and contralateral optic tracts. In the mouse retina, ventrotem-poral (VT) RGCs express the guidance receptor EphBl, which interacts with the repulsive guidance cue ephrin-B2 on radial glia at the optic chiasm to direct VT RGC axons ipsilaterally. RGCs in the ventral retina also express EphB2, which interacts with ephrin-B2, whereas dorsal RGCs express low levels of EphB receptors. To investigate how growth cones of RGCs from different retinal regions respond upon initial contact with ephrin-B2, we utilized time-lapse imaging to characterize the effects of ephrin-B2 on growth cone collapse and axon retraction in real time. We demonstrate that bath application of ephrin-B2 induces rapid and sustained growth cone collapse and axon retraction in VT RGC axons, whereas contralaterally-projecting dorsotemporal RGCs display moderate growth co},

Abstract = {Koro is a panic state associated with the thought that one's sex organ is disappearing into the body and the outcome of which is fatal. Koro is limited largely to young people of Han origin along the southern coast of China. Based on secondary data about a large-scale epidemic in southern China that lasted from August, 1984 to June, 1985, this paper examines how environmental and personal risk factors operate in a dynamic way to determine the way koro is manifested in Chinese people. Environmental risk factors include cultural attitudes and beliefs, news or rumors about koro, and an anxious neighborhood. Individual risk factors include education, age, and marital status. Koro in China is best conceived as a social malady supported by cultural myths that tend to affect young people who are deprived of proper sex information to explain their physical development.

Abstract = {A simple model of correlation-based synaptic plasticity via axonal sprouting and retraction (T. Elliott, C. I. Howarth, & N. R. Shadbolt, 1996a) is shown to be equivalent to the class of correlation-based models (K. D. Miller, J. B. Keller, & M. P. Stryker, 1989), although these were formulated in terms of weight modification of anatomically fixed synapses. Both models maximize the same measure of synaptic correlation, subject to constraints on connectivity. Thus, the analyses of the correlation-based models suffice to characterize the behavior of the sprouting-and-retraction model. More detailed models are needed for theoretical distinctions to be drawn between plasticity via sprouting and retraction or weight modification. The model of Elliott et al involves stochastic search through allowed weight patterns for those that improve correlations. That of Miller et al follows dynamical equations that determine continuous changes of the weights that improve correlations. The identity of },

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effects of the Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil, on the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells. In cultured N1E-115 cells, LPA produced a marked increase in the population of rounded cells. Fasudil or hydroxyfasudil, an active metabolite of fasudil, blocked cell rounding in a concentration-dependent manner at levels between 1 and 10μM, with IC₅₀ values of 1.7 or 1.6μM, respectively. Fasudil or hydroxyfasudil concentration-dependently inhibited phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase in N1E-115 cells. These results indicate that Rho-kinase is essential for LPA-induced neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells and that inactivation of Rho-kinase by a Rho-kinase inhibitor, such as fasudil, eliminates cell rounding and promotes neurite outgrowth, thus improving neurological function in the brain damage.

Chronic stress facilitates fear conditioning, impairs extinction, and produces dendritic proliferation in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a critical site of plasticity for extinction. Acute stress impairs extinction, alters plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex-to-BLA circuit, and causes dendritic retraction in the medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we examined extinction learning and basolateral amygdala pyramidal neuron morphology in adult male rats following a single elevated platform stress. Acute stress impaired extinction acquisition and memory, and produced dendritic retraction and increased mushroom spine density in basolateral amygdala neurons in the right hemisphere. Unexpectedly, irrespective of stress, rats that underwent fear and extinction testing showed basolateral amygdala dendritic },

Abstract = {Investigated influences on the development and retraction of unusual structures during early bilingual language development, by examining non-target syntactic structures produced by young German–English bilingual children. Four children were studied (audio and video recordings) from roughly 2–4 yrs of age. The results are described as supporting the contentions of the Competition Model that language acquisition proceeds through orientation to surface structures, and that cue competition across languages changes the weighting of cues within the language. The retreat from non-target structures was made possible through the children's attention to contrasts between the languages and the need to resolve structural incompatibilities within the language.

Abstract = {Koro is a culture-specific psychiatric disorder occurring primarily in Southeast Asian cultures. It is manifested by acute anxiety associated with the fear of genital retraction, accompanied by fear of death induced by the thought that complete disappearance of the genital organ will result in death. Koro has been described in non-Asian patients as well, leading to a debate concerning the culture-specific nature of the syndrome. Giving a psychopathological, nosological definition of this peculiar syndrome is also problematic. In this paper, the authors report a case of koro in a 29 yr old Korean female patient brought to their clinic because she had been running naked along a highway at night. She presented with anxiety, fear of impending death, and psychomotor restlessness. She was given droperidolum, and by the following morning, her behavior was composed, coordinated, and her anxiety had disappeared, and she was discharged.

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a German–Swedish comparative study on retractions in self-repair within prepositional phrases. Retraction, i.e., when a speaker returns to an earlier point within an unfolding grammatical structure, is a common resource used by both German and Swedish speakers when completing such actions as substituting, deleting, inserting, or repeating parts of an utterance. However, this resource is not necessarily used in the same ways in German and Swedish. Typological differences in the languages, such as word order and morphosyntactic characteristics, can affect the pattern of retraction (cf. Fox et al., 2009a, 2010). This paper examines whether grammatical differences in German and Swedish influence the retraction patterns in these languages. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Shortly after this manuscript was accepted for publication, new experiments indicated that brain slices expressing membrane-targeted fluorescent proteins can give rise to electrically evoked fluorescence changes in the absence of dipicrylamine. Since the same fluorescent proteins expressed in cultured cells give voltage-dependent fluorescence changes only in the presence of dipicrylamine, it was unable to explain the signals reported in hippocampal and spinal slices. Thus although these signals do arise from genetically targeted cells and are blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of electrical activity, it can no longer be said to what extent they reflect resonant energy transfer. This matter requires further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Spontaneous activity supports developmental processes in many brain regions during embryogenesis, and the spatial extent and frequency of the spontaneous activity are tightly regulated by stage. In the developing mouse hindbrain, spontaneous activity propagates widely and the waves can cover the entire hindbrain at E11.5. The activity then retracts to waves that are spatially restricted to the rostral midline at E13.5, before disappearing altogether by E15.5. However, the mechanism of retraction is unknown. We studied passive membrane properties of cells that are spatiotemporally relevant to the pattern of retraction inmouse embryonic hindbrain using whole-cell patch clamp and Cai2+ imaging techniques. We find that membrane excitability progressively decreases due to hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential and increased resting conductance density between E11.5 and E15.5, in a spatiotemporal pattern correlated with the retraction sequence.

Abstract = {As a cultural-bound syndrome, koro is described in the DSM-IV as "an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in females, the vulva and the nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death." Sometimes the syndrome may occur as an epidemic involving several hundreds to thousands of subjects within a short period of time. While the syndrome individually involves an anxiety reaction and fear of mortal genital retraction, it collectively takes the form of epidemics and mass panic. Recently a consensus has been reached about the fact that genital retraction is intimately related not only with ethno-cultural beliefs but also with the dramatic expression of acute anxiety and fear of impending catastrophe or death. We present two cases of koro syndrome who experienced severe anxiety due to the feeling of genital retraction and thus we question the cultural specifity of fears of genital retraction.

Immigration is among the most controversial social issues and hotly contested political topics in the United States today. This paper presents a review of the nation's attitudes toward immigration and the many facets of this issue—governmental policy, economic impact, current immigration levels, and illegal immigration. A review of the recent literature is presented, along with the results of opinion polls conducted by the Gallup Organization on the topic of immigration},

Abstract = {Maximal responses are often used as a measure of intrinsic activity or efficacy, but cannot be directly equated to efficacy. Using irreversible antagonists, estimates of efficacy can be obtained that may be less dependent on specific conditions. This study characterizes the intrinsic activity of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT])1A agonists by examining the effects of an irreversible antagonist on their ability to produce 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses. The effects of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) on the ability of 5-HT1A agonists to produce lower-lip retraction (LLR) in male rats were studied. Results show that in the absence of EEDQ, each 5-HT1A agonist produced full effects, the rank order of potency being: S 14506 > 8-OH-DPAT > buspirone > ipsapirone. EEDQ decreased the number of 5-HT1A binding sites and shifted the dose-response curves of each agonist either to the right or, at higher EEDQ doses, to the right and downward. The manner in which these},

Koro is similar to, but distinct from, the Chinese syndrome that carries its name and serves as the transcultural prototype; the category of genital retraction syndromes is proposed as a substitute for the use of "koro" as the transcultural rubric. In a review of the Koro literature, the many possible cultural and biomedical factors are considered. It is concluded that the issues and perspectives gained from studying the emic constructs of Koro are relevant to the wider study of culture-specific manifestations of genital retraction.

Abstract = {Human T‐cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV‐I)‐associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of axons and myelin in the corticospinal tracts. This central axonopathy may originate from the impairment of anterograde axoplasmic transport. Previous work showed tau hyperphosphorylation at T¹⁸¹ in cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients. Similar hyperphosphorylation occurs in SH‐SY5Y cells incubated with supernatant from MT‐2 cells (HTLV‐I‐infected lymphocytes secreting viral proteins, including Tax) that produce neurite shortening. Tau phosphorylation at T181 is attributable to glycogen synthase kinase 3‐β (GSK3‐β) and cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation. Here we investigate whether neurite retraction in the SH‐SY5Y model associates with concurrent changes in other tau hyperphosphorylable residues. Threonine 181 turned out to be the only tau hyperphosphorylated residue. We also evaluate the role of GSK3‐β a},

Its cardinal feature is an acute anxiety associated with the fear of genital retraction, accompanied by fear of death induced by a belief that complete disappearance of the genital organ will result in death. Koro has been described in non-Asian patients as well, leading to debate about the culture-specific nature of the syndrome. Giving a psychopathologic, a nosologic definition of koro is also problematic, reflected by the fact that the term "genital retraction syndrome" has become preferable.

Abstract = {With the support of expert opinions presented in 2 cases from his medical and legal practice, the present author examines the motives behind retracted confessions of individuals held for trial on criminal charges. It is suggested that some confessions are false due to psychiatric problems that, if detected in time, can prove the innocence of a person before trial. External pressures may lead to some retractions, but most interesting are those of innocents and their motives for confessing to a crime that did not take place. Numerous quotations from various authors elaborate on this aspect. Particular attention is focused on the necessity of conducting police interrogations prudently; in France they are limited to 48 hrs. In this context, sleep deprivation has a particularly injurious impact on efforts to acquire accurate information from suspects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present manuscript treats the problem of adapting a neural signal processing system whose parameters belong to a curved manifold, which is assumed to possess the structure of a Lie group. Neural system parameter adapting is effected by optimizing a system performance criterion. Riemannian-gradient-based optimization is suggested, which cannot be performed by standard additive stepping because of the curved nature of the parameter space. Retraction-based stepping is discussed, instead, along with a companion stepsize-schedule selection procedure. A case-study of learning by optimization of a non-quadratic criterion is discussed in detail. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Axon guidance molecules trigger a cascade of local signal in growth cones and evoke various morphologic responses, including axon attraction, repulsion, elongation, and retraction. However, little is known about whether subcellular compartments, other than axonal growth cones, control axon outgrowth. We found that in isolated dentate granule cells, local application of glutamate to the somatodendritic areas, but not the axon itself, induced rapid axon retraction, during which a calcium wave propagated from the somata to the axon terminals. The calcium wave and axon retraction were both inhibited by blockade of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and intracellular calcium dynamics. A combination of perisomatic application of calcium ionophore and depolarizing current injection induced axonal calcium sweep and axon retraction. Thus, perisomatic environments can modulate axon behavior through long-range intracellular communication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserv},

Abstract = {Changes in neuronal structure are thought to underlie long-term behavioral modifications associated with learning and memory. In particular, considerable evidence implicates the destabilization and retraction of dendritic spines along with the loss of spine synapses as an important cellular mechanism for refining brain circuits, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating spine elimination remain ill- defined. The postsynaptic density protein, PSD-95, is highly enriched in dendritic spines and has been associated with spine stability. Because spines with low levels of PSD-95 are more dynamic, and the recruitment of PSD-95 to nascent spines has been associated with spine stabilization, we hypothesized that loss of PSD-95 enrichment would be a prerequisite for spine retraction. To test this hypothesis, we used dual-color time-lapse two-photon microscopy to monitor rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons cotransfected with PSD-95-GFP and DsRed-Express, and we analyzed the relationship between PSD-},

Traumatic visual events and testicular retractions during the oedipal and latency years predisposed the ego functions concerned with visual perception to later involvement in conflict. The micropsia itself is seen as defending against castration anxiety by means of a series of unconscious fantasies of denial. These fantasies cause a regression to an earlier mode of visual perception (and to micropsia) characteristic of latency. The defensive modifications of the functions of the ego itself seen in micropsia are closely allied to those seen in the déjà vu experience and in depersonalization.

Abstract = {Structural remodeling of neurons occurs during development, regeneration, and in relation to learning and memory acquisition processes. These processes are associated with reconfiguration of the cytoskeleton, and are accompanied by adjustments of the plasma membrane surface area. Using cultured Aplysia neurons, we examined the role of membrane budgeting and the submembrane actin skeleton in determining the dimensions and shape of neurons. We found that the dimensions and cytoarchitecture of cultured neurons reach a steady state by maintaining a balance between constitutive plasma membrane retrieval and insertion. Constitutive membrane retrieval and the addition of Golgi-derived membranes are not coupled. Therefore, inhibition of Golgi-derived membrane supply by brefeldin A (BFA) leads to total retraction of the neurites. The process of BFA-induced neurite retraction is reversible upon washout. BFA-induced neurite retraction is associated with orderly retrograde shortening of the micro},

Abstract = {Parkinson’s disease has long been described to be a product of dopamine and (or) melanin loss in the substanstia nigra (SN). Although most studies have focused on dopaminergic neurons, it is important to consider the role of pigment cells in the etiology of the disease and to create an in vitro live cell model for studies involving pigmented adrenergic cells of the SN in Parkinsonism. The Melanocytes share specific features with the pigmented adrenergic neurons as both cells are pigmented, contain adrenergic receptors and have cellular processes. Although the melanocyte cellular processes are relatively short and observable only when stimulated appropriately by epinephrine and other factors or molecules. This study employs the manipulation of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDA-R), a major receptor in neuronal development, in the process formation pattern of the melanocyte in order to create a suitable model to depict cellular process elongation and shortening in pigmented adrenergic },

We investigated the role of motor pathways in covert orienting (attentional orienting without performing eye movements) by studying three patients suffering from Duane Retraction Syndrome—a congenital impairment in executing horizontal eye movements restricted to specific gaze directions. Patients showed a typical exogenous (reflexive) attention effect when the target was presented in visual fields to which they could perform an eye movement. This effect was not present when the target was presented in the visual field to which they could not perform eye movements. These findings stress the link between eye movements and attention. Specifically, they bring out the importance of the ability to execute appropriate eye movements for attentional orienting.

Ss (aged 29-85 yrs) included left-hemisphere-damaged (LHD) and right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD) aphasic patients and nonneurological controls. Ss were instructed to read sentences containing double-stressed target words in the presence of a clause boundary or its absence. Whereas all 3 groups of Ss were capable of manipulating the acoustic parameters that signal a shift in stress, there were some differences between the performance of the patient groups and that of controls. Further, stress production deficits were more severe in LHD aphasic patients than in RHD patients. LHD speakers exhibited deficits in the control of both temporal and fundamental frequency (F₀) cues. Their F₀ disturbance appears to be secondary to a primary deficit in temporal control },

Abstract = {Neurons are differentiated postmitotic cells residing in G₀ phase of the cell cycle and are unable to proceed through G₁ phase, in which cyclinD1 needs to be up-regulated for initiation. Yet, a growing body of evidence has shown that cell cycle re-activation via cyclinD1 up-regulation drives neurons into apoptosis. By contrast, there is also evidence demonstrating cell cycle proteins playing roles in neuronal differentiation. cyclinD1 has been shown to be differently regulated by protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) in various mitotic cells. Based on these different effects, we investigated the role of PKC-α on cyclinD1 regulation in hippocampal neurons. Neurons were treated with PKC activator, PMA, and analysed for subcellular distributions of PKC-α and cyclinD1. Remarkably, PMA treatment increased nuclear PKC-α and cyclinD1, but not PKC-ε in hippocampal neurons. Increases in nuclear PKC-α and cyclinD1 were accompanied by microtubule re-organisation via increases in tau and retinoblastoma },

These lessons include: (1) the risk of over-optimistic predictions concerning the time-scale and resources required for major bed reduction; (2) the problems associated with "creaming off," with the risk of increasing acuity in the residual inpatient population accompanied by deterioration in the quality of the retracting services; (3) the risk of "silting up" in the reprovided services in the absence of an appropriate community infrastructure; and (4) the importance of quality of life for longer-stay secure inpatients.

Abstract = {Axonal regression is utilized to refine neuronal circuits during development, but the dynamic properties of such regression remain largely unknown. We used confocal time-lapse imaging to examine the regression of single enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-labeled axons in corticospinal slice cocultures. By acquiring images at long (1 day) and short (30-60 min) intervals on days 5-13 in vitro, we detected three types of regressive events: 1) retractions, 2) amputations (referred to as autoaxotomy), and 3) degeneration. Retractions proceeded at some constant rate for up to 3 hours and then paused or switched to another constant rate, apparently shifting stepwise among three retraction rates (6, 12, 17 μm/hours). Autoaxotomy was a previously unreported strategy for regression. It occurred spontaneously, either at a proximal branch neck or at a distal end. Axons also underwent a form of degeneration that had several novel characteristics. Degenerating axons showed bright bead-like spots a},

When consumers are reminded of money, do they conform, shrug off, or react against others’ attempts to influence them? Prior research on reminders of money suggests that either of the last two outcomes is probable. The current research proposed that the self-sufficient motivation induced by money reminders causes consumers to perceive social influences as threats to their autonomy. We predicted that consumers reminded of money would deviate from social influence, an effect},

This article has plagiarized parts of other papers that had already appeared in Neuron, 24(1), 1999, pp. 11–17 (doi:10.1016/S0896- 6273(00)80818-1); Neuron, 24(1), 1999, pp. 31–47 (doi:10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80820-X); and Psychol Res 71(1), 2007, pp. 1–3 (doi:10.1007/s00426-005-0030-6). One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that their work is original and has not appeared in a publication elsewhere. Re-use of any material should be appropriately cited. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.

Abstract = {The formation of spinules at the terminal dendrites of retinal horizontal cells with the onset of light and their subsequent retraction during darkness is a remarkable example of synaptic plasticity where sensory experience modifies reversibly, and on a time scale of minutes the ultrastructure of synaptic connectivity. The signals and the subsequent intracellular cascades underlying the prominent morphological alterations are only partially understood. We show here that lowering the external calcium concentration did prevent dark- and AMPA-induced retraction of spinules in an eyecup preparation. Furthermore, spinule retraction was prevented in vivo by the injection of calmidazolium, an inhibitor of calmodulin, into the eyeball, and also by the injection of KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMkll). We conclude that local Ca2+ influx through AMPA-gated channels followed by activation of CaMkll is an important step for spinule retraction during dark ada},

Miller and Huaiyu Hu (see record [rid]2009-05937-006[/rid]). An investigative committee at SUNY Upstate had determined that Dr. Michael Miller was guilty of multiple counts of research misconduct and the collected data may also be unreliable. Accordingly, on October 18, 2011, we requested that a letter of retraction be provided that was co-authored and co-signed by both authors. It was our view that for an action as severe as an article retraction, both authors needed to sign the retraction letter. Therefore, at the request of the President of SUNY Upstate, with this statement we formally retract the article by Drs. Miller and Hu, Developmental Neuroscience 2009;31:50–57.

Ss from a specialty tic disorders clinic were randomly assigned to receive 8 wks of treatment with lofexidine or placebo under double-blind conditions. 44 medication-free Ss with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder participated. After 8 wks of treatment, lofexidine was associated with a mean improvement of 41% in the total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale },

Abstract = {Genetic evidence suggests cell-type–specific functions for certain nucleoporins, and gene expression profiling has revealed that nucleoporin p62 (NUP62) transcripts are decreased in the prefrontal cortex of major depressives. Chronic stress, which can precipitate depression, induces changes in the architecture and plasticity of apical dendrites that are particularly evident in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Genetically targeted translating ribosome affinity purification revealed a selective reduction in translated Nup62 transcripts in CA3 of chronically stressed mice, and the Nup62 protein content of nuclei extracted from whole hippocampus was found to be decreased in chronically stressed rats. In cultured cells, phosphorylation of a FAK/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) consensus site in the alpha-helical domain of NUP62 (human Y422) is shown to be associated with shedding of NUP62 from the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and/or retention of NUP62 in the cytoplasm. Increased level},

Abstract = {We examined all 208 closed cases involving official findings of research misconduct published by the US Office of Research Integrity from 1992 to 2011 to determine how often scientists mention in a retraction or correction notice that there was an ethical problem with an associated article. 75 of these cases cited at least one published article affected by misconduct for a total of 174 articles. For 127 of these 174, we found both the article and a retraction or correction statement. Since eight of the 127 published statements consisted of simply the word 'retracted,' our analysis focused on the remaining 119 for which a more detailed retraction or correction was published. Of these 119 statements, only 41.2% mentioned ethics at all (and only 32.8% named a specific ethical problem such as fabrication, falsification or plagiarism), whereas the other 58.8% described the reason for retraction or correction as error, loss of data or replication failure when misconduct was actually at issu},

Abstract = {When neurons exit the cell cycle after their terminal mitosis, they detach from the apical surface of the neuroepithelium. Despite the fact that this detachment is crucial for further neurogenesis and neuronal migration, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Here, taking advantage of the genetics and imaging possibilities of the zebrafish retina as a model system, we show by knockdown experiments that the guidance molecule Slit1b and its receptor Robo3 are required for apical retraction of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In contrast, N-cadherin seems to be responsible for maintenance of apical attachment, as expression of dominant-negative N-cadherin causes RGCs to lose apical attachments prematurely and rescues retraction in slit1b morphants. These results suggest that Slit-Robo signaling downregulates N-cadherin activity to allow apical retraction in newly generated RGCs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: During development, excess synapses form between the central and peripheral nervous systems that are then eliminated to achieve correct connectivity. In the peripheral auditory system, the developing type I spiral ganglion afferent fibres undergo a dramatic re-organisation, initially forming connections with both sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). The OHC connections are then selectively eliminated, leaving sparse innervation by type II afferent fibres, whilst the type I afferent synapses with IHCs are consolidated. Results: We examined the molecular makeup of the synaptic contacts formed onto the IHCs and OHCs during this period of afferent fibre remodelling. We observed that presynaptic ribbons initially form at all the afferent neurite contacts, i.e. not only at the expected developing IHC-type I fibre synapses but also at OHCs where type I fibres temporarily contact. Moreover, the transient contacts forming onto OHCs possess a broad set of pre},

Abstract = {This article examines the subsequent impact of a temporary price discount on brand preference after the promotion is retracted. Theorizing that price salience has an impact on price sensitivity, we propose that the effects of retracting a discount depend on the promoted brand's regular price-quality positioning. In a first experiment in which we track consumer choices across a sequence of choice occasions, we show that retracting a discount posted by a higher quality, higher price brand is detrimental to that brand. In contrast, a discount posted by a lower quality, lower price brand is capable of enduringly diverting consumers away from high-end brands. A second experiment relies on process measures to provide evidence for the underlying price salience mechanism. A third experiment tests our hypotheses with real incentives and offers additional support for our price salience theory by testing its most peculiar behavioral implication.

One measure of reactivity to pain, limb retraction from a hotplate, was utilized for 3 different limbs (forepaw, hindpaw, and tail) to chart the development of opioid sensitivity. Morphine-induced antinociception, even in 2-day-old Ss, was obtained for all limbs, in a dose-related fashion, and reached peak sensitivity at 6–7 days of age. Data demonstrate early antinociception to low doses of an opiate and establish that the pain system, like positive reinforcement systems, is opiate sensitive.

It is argued that the collection and examination of retraction statements often does not receive the same careful attention as is the case with the investigation of the original allegations. Logically, depending on whether the original complaints were true or false or a mixture, so the meaning of a retraction may vary. Where retractions are examined and evaluated with care they may be shown to add to the confidence of the final conclusion rather than simply throwing doubt on that.

Gutierrez, Gil Diesendruck, Mahzarin R. Banaji and Laurie R. Santos (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2011[Mar], Vol 100[3], 387-405). The retraction is at the request of the authors. This article reported two independent sets of effects concerning monkeys’ intergroup behavior: (a) that there are differences in monkeys’ vigilance toward ingroup and outgroup members (Experiments 1–5) and (b) that monkeys show implicit associations toward ingroup and outgroup members (Experiments 6 and 7). After lab members were unable to replicate the first set of published effects for new research purposes, the authors determined that the looking time coding performed by one of the coauthors, N. Mahajan, was inaccurate and did not reflect the looking times found by other trained coders. Ms. Mahajan takes sole responsibility for the i},

Abstract = {L-type voltage gated calcium channels have an important role in neuronal development by promoting dendritic growth and arborization. A point mutation in the gene encoding CaV1.2 causes Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We report that channels with the Timothy syndrome alteration cause activity-dependent dendrite retraction in rat and mouse neurons and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Dendrite retraction was independent of calcium permeation through the mutant channel, was associated with ectopic activation of RhoA and was inhibited by overexpression of the channel-associated GTPase Gem. These results suggest that CaV1.2 can activate RhoA signaling independently of Ca2+ and provide insights into the cellular basis of Timothy syndrome and other ASDs.

Abstract = {The chick embryo (Gallus domesticus) is one of the most important model systems in vertebrate developmental biology. The development and function of its auditory brainstem circuitry is exceptionally well studied. These circuits represent an excellent system for genetic manipulation to investigate mechanisms controlling neural circuit formation, synaptogenesis, neuronal polarity, and dendritic arborization. The present study investigates the auditory nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM). The neurotrophin receptor TrkB regulates dendritic structure in CNS neurons. TrkB is expressed in NM neurons at E7–E8 when these neurons have dendritic arbors. Downregulation of TrkB occurs after E8 followed by retraction of dendrites and by E18 most NM cells are adendritic. Is cessation of TrkB expression in NM necessary for dendritic retraction? To answer this question we combined focal in ovo electroporation with transposon mediated gene transfer to obtain stable expression of Doxycycline (Dox) reg},

Pignotti (see record [rid]2005-02305-010[/rid]) makes critical assertions about S-HRV with no evidence or authoritative support for these curious assertions. Short-term measures have advantages over long-term measures. The power of Thought Field Therapy (TFT) is demonstrated through unprecedented HRV improvements as well as other physiologic indices such as skin color, microscopic measures, and increases in T-cell numbers after successful TFT. Bilchick and associates' hypothesis (2002), "Each increase of 10 ms in standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) conferred a 20% decrease in risk of mortality (p = .0001)" is a bold and speculative position that appears to have general, if not highly specific, merit when applied to all groups investigated with HRV.

Abstract = {Background: Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital ocular motility disorder characterized by limited abduction and/or limited adduction, globe retraction, and narrowing of the palpebral fissure on adduction. Because of adduction limits, these patients may also exhibit convergence insufficiency (CI). Symptomatic individuals can often benefit from optometric vision therapy (OVT). Although OVT does not treat the DRS itself, these procedural interventions can alleviate symptoms by improving vergence and accommodative ability. Case: A 10-year-old girl was referred for complaints of asthenopia at near and intermittent horizontal diplopia on side gaze. She exhibited signs of intermittent alternating exotropia at near and poor pursuit eye movements. A visual skills evaluation revealed DRS and CI; with the latter being managed successfully with OVT. Symptoms were relieved entirely with a relatively short course of therapy for the CI, despite the presence of adduction limitations due t},

Abstract = {Chronic stress produces consistent and reversible changes within the dendritic arbors of CA3 hippocampal neurons, characterized by decreased dendritic length and reduced branch number. This chronic stress-induced dendritic retraction has traditionally corresponded to hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficits. However, anomalous findings have raised doubts as to whether a CA3 dendritic retraction is sufficient to compromise hippocampal function. The purpose of this review is to outline the mechanism underlying chronic stress-induced CA3 dendritic retraction and to explain why CA3 dendritic retraction has been thought to mediate spatial memory. The anomalous findings provide support for a modified hypothesis, in which chronic stress is proposed to induce CA3 dendritic retraction, which then disrupts hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, leading to dysregulated glucocorticoid release. The combination of hippocampal CA3 dendritic retraction and elevated glucocorticoid release },

Abstract = {Background: Journal editors are responsible for what they publish and therefore have a duty to correct the record if published work is found to be unreliable. One method for such correction is retraction of an article. Anecdotal evidence suggested a lack of consistency in journal policies and practices regarding retraction. In order to develop guidelines, we reviewed retractions in Medline to discover how and why articles were retracted. Methods: We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008 and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators. Results: Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and currently represent 0 02% of included articles.

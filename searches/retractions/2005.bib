Abstract = {The present article reviews the syndrome of genital retraction (SGR) from the perspective of transcultural psychiatry. It is best known as a culture-bound syndrome in Asia, e.g. koro in Indonesia or suo yang in Southern China, where it can be also observed in so-called epidemics. The syndrome is characterised by the sensation that the genitals are shrinking and being pulled back into the abdomen; this perception is associated with fear of death, because the subjects expect to die as soon as the genital has disappeared completely. Particularly in the case of suo yang, the involvement of local traditional concepts of illness can be established. In the Western world, however, SGR is observed only in single cases. The symptoms are less dramatic and do not show a particular cultural context. This form of SGR is called "koro-like" (koro-like symptoms, KLS). In contrast to the Asian form, KLS are not observed in healthy subjects, but as an unspecific syndrome related to other neuropsychiatri},

Abstract = {The high-security hospitals are undergoing a retraction process. In conjunction with this, regional services are being developed for those patients who require longer term treatment at medium-security units. This paper aims to provide an overview of the issues involved, along with the background against which these changes are taking place and the uncertainties involved in the process. This current paper will use the information available from the Fender reports and other evidence to examine potential implications of the major changes that are underway in the high-security hospitals. Major changes are taking place in prison healthcare that will impact upon the demand for beds in both mediumand high-security units. The impact upon the prison sector of inadequate numbers of high-security beds is likely to be serious. The high-security hospitals provide treatment for the most challenging and complex minority of prisoners transferred into the healthcare system. There is a risk that the ma},

Abstract = {This article is a retraction of the conclusions drawn in a previous article(see record [rid]2001-18792-001[/rid]), published as part of a special October 2001 issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychology on Thought Field Therapy (TFT). I decided to write this retraction after reconsidering a number of issues raised in the critiques of the articles. Additionally, subsequent misinterpretations of the literature on heart rate variability (HRV) by Roger Callahan, which led to further questioning of his premises and claims regarding TFT and HRV as represented in the articles, are discussed. I conclude that the burden of proof is on TFT proponents to demonstrate its efficacy and that well-designed controlled studies using standardized assessment measures and long-term follow-up must be performed to allow the scientific community to take claims made for TFT seriously.

Abstract = {Short-term heart rate variability (S-HRV) is a valid and reliable measure of health and therapy effectiveness. Pignotti (see record [rid]2005-02305-010[/rid]) makes critical assertions about S-HRV with no evidence or authoritative support for these curious assertions. Short-term measures have advantages over long-term measures. The power of Thought Field Therapy (TFT) is demonstrated through unprecedented HRV improvements as well as other physiologic indices such as skin color, microscopic measures, and increases in T-cell numbers after successful TFT. Bilchick and associates' hypothesis (2002), "Each increase of 10 ms in standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) conferred a 20% decrease in risk of mortality (p = .0001)" is a bold and speculative position that appears to have general, if not highly specific, merit when applied to all groups investigated with HRV.

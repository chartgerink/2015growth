Abstract = {Retracts W. J. Jacobs et al (see record [rid]1989-14538-001[/rid]) because of a failure to find latent spatial learning in the Morris Water Task using the same method. In addition, reexamination of the earlier study revealed that if discarded data from 2 rats with abnormally high scores had been included in the analysis, the results would have been nonsignificant. Methodological confounds may also have contributed to the earlier results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Posits that Freud's retraction of the seduction theory and his conclusions (1911) about the autobiographical account of a man with psychosis, whose father reportedly abused him as a child, reflect his denial of his own and his siblings' sexual abuse by his father. It is argued that the retraction was brought about by Freud's self-analysis after his father's death. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Discusses "Koro," the belief or delusion of retraction of the penis into the abdomen, which may be associated with anxiety, with primary psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia, or with sexual conflicts. Originally thought to be a Chinese and Indonesian culture-bound syndrome, it has recently been noted to occur in Western patients. Two Western Black males (19 and 43 yrs of age) with this syndrome are described, and their psychotherapeutic treatment and outcome are outlined. A stepwise approach to the treatment of the Koro symptom is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

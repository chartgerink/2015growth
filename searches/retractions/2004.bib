Abstract = {Insect metamorphosis is a compelling example for dendritic and synaptic remodeling as larval and adult behaviors place distinct demands on the CNS. During the metamorphosis of the moth, Manducasexta, many larval motoneurons are remodeled to serve a new function in the adult. During late larval life, steroid hormones trigger axonal and dendritic regression as well as larval synapse elimination. These regressive events are accompanied by stereotypical changes in motor behavior during the so-called wandering stages. Both normally occurring changes in dendritic shape and in motor output have previously been analyzed quantitatively for the individually identified motoneuron MN5. This study tested whether activity affected steroid-induced dendritic regression and synapse disassembly in MN5 by means of chronically implanted extracellular electrodes. Stimulating MN5 in vivo in intact, normally developing animals during a developmental period when it usually shows no activity significantly slo},

Abstract = {This study investigates the responses to phasic shoulder retractions or protractions given at different times in the fictive locomotor cycle of the forelimbs of decerebrate cats. Generally, the responses in flexor and extensor muscles acting at the shoulder or elbow were bilaterally coordinated according to a negative feedback scheme. Perturbations in the direction of the movements that would have taken place if the animal had not been paralyzed tended to shorten the duration of the burst of activity of the muscles active during that phase and vice versa in the opposite phase. Changes in response patterns took place around critical points corresponding to the critical points B-D described in the companion paper using tonic perturbations of the limb. Past point C, at 58% of the ipsilateral extensor burst, protractions no longer prolonged the burst and no longer delayed onset of the contralateral extensor. At point B, occurring at 41% of the contralateral extensor burst, ipsilateral pro},

Abstract = {19 subjects (10 men, 9 women) ages 19 to 30 years (M=23.2, SD=3.3) volunteered to participate in a study to investigate the just-noticeable-difference in movement extent for neck retraction and neck rotation. Testing was carried out with stopped movements, conducted according to the method of constant stimuli, and repeated both with and without vision in a comfortable seated position. Sensitivity was greatest for neck-retraction movements, which had lower just-noticeable-difference than either left or right rotation movements. Having full vision available gave no significant advantage in any direction when discriminating between different extents of midrange head movements.

Abstract = {This article examines the subsequent impact of a temporary price discount on brand preference after the promotion is retracted. Theorizing that price salience has an impact on price sensitivity, we propose that the effects of retracting a discount depend on the promoted brand's regular price-quality positioning. In a first experiment in which we track consumer choices across a sequence of choice occasions, we show that retracting a discount posted by a higher quality, higher price brand is detrimental to that brand. In contrast, a discount posted by a lower quality, lower price brand is capable of enduringly diverting consumers away from high-end brands. A second experiment relies on process measures to provide evidence for the underlying price salience mechanism. A third experiment tests our hypotheses with real incentives and offers additional support for our price salience theory by testing its most peculiar behavioral implication.

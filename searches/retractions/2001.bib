Abstract = {The pathological mechanism of convergence retraction nystagmus (CRN) is not known. To determine whether CRN is a disorder of vergence or of the saccadic system, the scleral search coil technique was used to record binocularly the three-dimensional components of CRN in a 62-yr-old male patient with a left mesencephalic infarction involving the nucleus of the posterior commissurc and the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle. CRN had disconjugate horizontal and torsional components. The horizontal amplitude/velocity relationship of CRN aligned with the main sequence of vergence responses of normal control subjects but not with that of saccades. Vergence responses of the right eye and left eye were not asynchronous. The slow phases of CRN showed an exponential decay with a time constant of 70 milliseconds. Thus, CRN is probably a disorder of vergence rather than of opposing adducting saccades. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {An acoustic-perceptual investigation of a phonological phenomenon in which stress is retracted in double-stressed words (e.g., thirTEEN vs THIRteen MEN) was undertaken to identify the locus of functional impairments in speech prosody. Ss (aged 29-85 yrs) included left-hemisphere-damaged (LHD) and right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD) aphasic patients and nonneurological controls. Ss were instructed to read sentences containing double-stressed target words in the presence of a clause boundary or its absence. Whereas all 3 groups of Ss were capable of manipulating the acoustic parameters that signal a shift in stress, there were some differences between the performance of the patient groups and that of controls. Further, stress production deficits were more severe in LHD aphasic patients than in RHD patients. LHD speakers exhibited deficits in the control of both temporal and fundamental frequency (F₀) cues. Their F₀ disturbance appears to be secondary to a primary deficit in temporal control },

It is argued that the published studies based on the incidence approach to the costs of smoking, even on their own terms and accepting the stated assumptions, are erroneous, yielding cost estimates that are too high.

This question was addressed in two experiments (n = 180 women) by examining the effects of social comparisons on women's attributions for a failing test grade. The results suggest that women are most likely to make an attribution to discrimination when they compare themselves to another woman who received a failing grade and a man who received a better grade from the same male judge. However, these effects only emerge when women are made aware of the possibility that the male judge might be biased against them. The implications of these findings are discussed and fut},

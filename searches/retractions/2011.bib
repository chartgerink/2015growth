Abstract = {Information that is presumed to be true at encoding but later on turns out to be false (i.e., misinformation) often continues to influence memory and reasoning. In the present study, we investigated how the strength of encoding and the strength of a later retraction of the misinformation affect this continued influence effect. Participants read an event report containing misinformation and a subsequent correction. Encoding strength of the misinformation and correction were orthogonally manipulated either via repetition (Experiment 1) or by imposing a cognitive load during reading (Experiment 2). Results suggest that stronger retractions are effective in reducing the continued influence effects associated with strong misinformation encoding, but that even strong retractions fail to eliminate continued influence effects associated with relatively weak encoding. We present a simple computational model based on random sampling that captures this effect pattern, and conclude that the conti},

Abstract = {Eating high fat food can alter sensitivity to drugs acting on dopamine systems; this study examined whether eating high fat food alters sensitivity to a drug acting on serotonin (5-HT) systems. Sensitivity to (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; 5-HT1A receptor agonist)-induced lower lip retraction was examined in separate groups (n=8–9) of rats with free access to standard (5.7% fat) or high fat (34.3% fat) chow; sensitivity to quinpirole (dopamine D₃/D₂ receptor agonist)-induced yawning was also examined. Rats eating high fat chow gained more body weight than rats eating standard chow and, after 6 weeks of eating high fat chow, they were more sensitive to 8-OH-DPAT (0.01–0.1 mg/kg)-induced lower lip retraction and quinpirole (0.0032–0.32 mg/kg)-induced yawning. These changes were not reversed when rats that previously ate high fat chow were switched to eating standard chow and sensitivity to 8-OH-DPAT and quinpirole increased when rats that previously at},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effects of the Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil, on the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells. In cultured N1E-115 cells, LPA produced a marked increase in the population of rounded cells. Fasudil or hydroxyfasudil, an active metabolite of fasudil, blocked cell rounding in a concentration-dependent manner at levels between 1 and 10μM, with IC₅₀ values of 1.7 or 1.6μM, respectively. Fasudil or hydroxyfasudil concentration-dependently inhibited phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase in N1E-115 cells. These results indicate that Rho-kinase is essential for LPA-induced neurite retraction in N1E-115 cells and that inactivation of Rho-kinase by a Rho-kinase inhibitor, such as fasudil, eliminates cell rounding and promotes neurite outgrowth, thus improving neurological function in the brain damage.

Abstract = {Human T‐cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV‐I)‐associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of axons and myelin in the corticospinal tracts. This central axonopathy may originate from the impairment of anterograde axoplasmic transport. Previous work showed tau hyperphosphorylation at T¹⁸¹ in cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients. Similar hyperphosphorylation occurs in SH‐SY5Y cells incubated with supernatant from MT‐2 cells (HTLV‐I‐infected lymphocytes secreting viral proteins, including Tax) that produce neurite shortening. Tau phosphorylation at T181 is attributable to glycogen synthase kinase 3‐β (GSK3‐β) and cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation. Here we investigate whether neurite retraction in the SH‐SY5Y model associates with concurrent changes in other tau hyperphosphorylable residues. Threonine 181 turned out to be the only tau hyperphosphorylated residue. We also evaluate the role of GSK3‐β a},

Abstract = {Changes in neuronal structure are thought to underlie long-term behavioral modifications associated with learning and memory. In particular, considerable evidence implicates the destabilization and retraction of dendritic spines along with the loss of spine synapses as an important cellular mechanism for refining brain circuits, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating spine elimination remain ill- defined. The postsynaptic density protein, PSD-95, is highly enriched in dendritic spines and has been associated with spine stability. Because spines with low levels of PSD-95 are more dynamic, and the recruitment of PSD-95 to nascent spines has been associated with spine stabilization, we hypothesized that loss of PSD-95 enrichment would be a prerequisite for spine retraction. To test this hypothesis, we used dual-color time-lapse two-photon microscopy to monitor rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons cotransfected with PSD-95-GFP and DsRed-Express, and we analyzed the relationship between PSD-},

Abstract = {This article presents a retraction of 'But you might be damaging your baby’: Constructing choice and risk in labour and childbirth from the journal Feminism & Psychology. The article is retracted on the basis of two errors. The first error is a transcription error, which occurs on extract 6 of the article where the final sentence has been ascribed incorrectly to the class leader. The second error was the use of the plural 'course leaders'. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Clinical papers so flawed that they are eventually retracted may put patients at risk. Patient risk could arise in a retracted primary study or in any secondary study that draws ideas or inspiration from a primary study. Methods: To determine how many patients were put at risk, we evaluated 788 retracted English-language papers published from 2000 to 2010, describing new research with humans or freshly derived human material. These primary papers—together with all secondary studies citing them—were evaluated using ISI Web of Knowledge. Excluded from study were 468 basic science papers not studying fresh human material; 88 reviews presenting older data; 22 case reports; 7 papers retracted for journal error and 23 papers unavailable on Web of Knowledge. Overall, 180 retracted primary papers (22.8%) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated in 180 primary studies and 851 secondary studies were combined. Results: Retracted papers were cited over 5000 t},

Abstract = {Background: Papers retracted for fraud (data fabrication or data falsification) may represent a deliberate effort to deceive, a motivation fundamentally different from papers retracted for error. It is hypothesised that fraudulent authors target journals with a high impact factor (IF), have other fraudulent publications, diffuse responsibility across many co-authors, delay retracting fraudulent papers and publish from countries with a weak research infrastructure. Methods: All 788 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Data pertinent to each retracted paper were abstracted from the paper and the reasons for retraction were derived from the retraction notice and dichotomised as fraud or error. Data for each retracted article were entered in an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. Results: Journal IF was higher for fraudulent papers (p < 0.001). Roughly 53% of fraudulent papers were written by a first author who had written o},

Abstract = {Background: Scientific papers are retracted for many reasons including fraud (data fabrication or falsification) or error (plagiarism, scientific mistake, ethical problems). Growing attention to fraud in the lay press suggests that the incidence of fraud is increasing. Methods: The reasons for retracting 742 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Reasons for retraction were initially dichotomised as fraud or error and then analysed to determine specific reasons for retraction. Results: Error was more common than fraud (73.5% of papers were retracted for error (or an undisclosed reason) vs 26.6% retracted for fraud). Eight reasons for retraction were identified; the most common reason was scientific mistake in 234 papers (31.5%), but 134 papers (18.1%) were retracted for ambiguous reasons. Fabrication (including data plagiarism) was more common than text plagiarism. Total papers retracted per year have increased sharply},

This article was voluntarily retracted by the authors because further work has established that their positive result was likely artifactual.

Abstract = {Background: Journal editors are responsible for what they publish and therefore have a duty to correct the record if published work is found to be unreliable. One method for such correction is retraction of an article. Anecdotal evidence suggested a lack of consistency in journal policies and practices regarding retraction. In order to develop guidelines, we reviewed retractions in Medline to discover how and why articles were retracted. Methods: We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008 and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators. Results: Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and currently represent 0 02% of included articles. Retractions were issued by authors (63%), editors (21%), journals (6%), publishers (2%) and institutions (1%). Reasons for retraction included honest erro},

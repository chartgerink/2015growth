Abstract = {Atypological study of 825 patients revealed certain correlates between constitution and mental illness. The subjects were classified according to anthropometric measurements and Kretchmerian classifications. The goal was to explore relationships between epilepsy and physique. The present study amplifies characteristics of the "dilaté" as follows: (1) physiologically, the respiration index of the "dilaté" exceeds his inspiration index, (2) humorally, the "dilaté" suffers from digestive disturbances, (3) psychophysiologically, the "dilaté" gives Rorschach responses which are self-centered and impoverished, and (4) his EEG reveals qualitative differences.

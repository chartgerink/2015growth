Abstract = {Describes Koro, a disorder characterized by complaints of genital hyperinvolution and fear of impending death, which is found to be indigenous to certain populations of insular Southeast Asia. Koro is similar to, but distinct from, the Chinese syndrome that carries its name and serves as the transcultural prototype; the category of genital retraction syndromes is proposed as a substitute for the use of "koro" as the transcultural rubric. In a review of the Koro literature, the many possible cultural and biomedical factors are considered. It is concluded that the issues and perspectives gained from studying the emic constructs of Koro are relevant to the wider study of culture-specific manifestations of genital retraction.

Abstract = {Experiments employing horseradish-peroxidase-labeling in neonatal hooded Lister rats demonstrated that there was temporal contiguity between ganglion cell death and terminal field retraction in the developing ipsilateral visual pathway. The removal of one eye at birth did not stabilize the number of cells that gave rise to this projection. The proportion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus occupied by ipsilateral projecting ganglion cells was similar in neonates of a given age and adults that had been enucleated at that age.

Abstract = {Examined the morphology of an identified molluscan (Helisoma) neuron subsequent to exposure of animals to a variety of forms of stress: (1) bleeding due to incision in the body wall, (2) desiccation so as to cause an estivation response, or (3) exposure to extreme temperatures. The neuron exhibited the sprouting and retraction of a single neurite in response to bleeding and desiccation only. It is suggested that this new form of neuronal plasticity may provide an insight into the factors regulating adult neuronal morphology.

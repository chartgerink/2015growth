Abstract = {Demonstrates that retroflexion and retraction are distinct and contrastive and that consonants produced with retroflexion show a number of phonological characteristics that differentiate them from sounds that are produced without it. It is argued that a system of phonetics that does not characterize the retroflexed consonants by their specific articulation would fail to take care of some of their phonological properties.

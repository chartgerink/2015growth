Abstract = {Used morphological and electrophysiological techniques to assess the location and surface structure of the peripheral processes of putative wing mechanoreceptors involved in wing retraction in Clione limacina. Results concerning the wing retraction reflex, identification of sensory cells, surface ultrastructure of wings, and ultrastructure of ciliary cones are discussed. Results suggest that cone structures of the lateral wing surfaces are likely terminal processes of central mechanoreceptive neurons involved in the wing withdrawal reflex in Clione.

Abstract = {The formation of spinules at the terminal dendrites of retinal horizontal cells with the onset of light and their subsequent retraction during darkness is a remarkable example of synaptic plasticity where sensory experience modifies reversibly, and on a time scale of minutes the ultrastructure of synaptic connectivity. The signals and the subsequent intracellular cascades underlying the prominent morphological alterations are only partially understood. We show here that lowering the external calcium concentration did prevent dark- and AMPA-induced retraction of spinules in an eyecup preparation. Furthermore, spinule retraction was prevented in vivo by the injection of calmidazolium, an inhibitor of calmodulin, into the eyeball, and also by the injection of KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMkll). We conclude that local Ca2+ influx through AMPA-gated channels followed by activation of CaMkll is an important step for spinule retraction during dark ada},

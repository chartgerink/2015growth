Abstract = {Scholars have noted that survey analysis of small subsamples—for example, same-sex parent families—is sensitive to researchers’ analytical decisions, and even small differences in coding can profoundly shape empirical patterns. As an illustration, we reassess the findings of a recent article by Regnerus regarding the implications of being raised by gay and lesbian parents. Taking a close look at the New Family Structures Study (NFSS), we demonstrate the potential for misclassifying a non-negligible number of respondents as having been raised by parents who had a same-sex romantic relationship. We assess the implications of these possible misclassifications, along with other methodological considerations, by reanalyzing the NFSS in seven steps. The reanalysis offers evidence that the empirical patterns showcased in the original Regnerus article are fragile—so fragile that they appear largely a function of these possible misclassifications and other methodological choices. Our replication and reanalysis of Regnerus’s study offer a cautionary illustration of the importance of double checking and critically assessing the implications of measurement and other methodological decisions in our and others’ research.

Abstract = {Dutch modal verb hoeven ‘need’ is a Negative Polarity Item (NPI) because of its restricted distribution to certain negative contexts only. By investigating the distribution of this NPI in child Dutch, the paper explores a solution to a learnability problem raised by the existence of NPIs: how can a child acquire the limited distribution of an NPI in the absence of both direct and indirect negative evidence? Corpus data collected through CHILDES confirm children’s employment of a conservative widening learning strategy to solve the learnability problem. This strategy entails that children start out with the strictest assumption of hoeven, exhibiting a lexical dependency with the negative marker niet ‘not’, and weaken the assumption down to a less rigid reanalysis of this NPI, associated with an abstract negation in its underlying syntactic representation. The initial learning process turns out to be distribution-based only, i.e., without presuming any innate knowledge of NPIs and their restricted occurrences. However, distributional properties alone are not sufficient for children to reanalyze the NPI. Children’s linguistic knowledge of negative indefinites as exhibiting a decomposable negation plays a crucial role in the subsequent reanalyzing process. The reanalysis emerging shortly after age four signifies exactly how adult speakers analyze the NPI, also explaining hoeven’s strength as a polarity item.

Abstract = {School-to-school collaboration as a school improvement method has grown in importance in England in recent years, and there is some evidence that such collaboration can have a positive impact on both capacity to change and student attainment. Most previous work in the area has focused on the urban context, however, despite the fact that increasing numbers of underperforming rural schools might benefit from collaboration. In this paper we examine the impact of collaboration using a quantitative reanalysis of rural school data from a previous study. We also discuss the conditions under which collaboration in rural areas is likely to be successful, using both reanalysis of rural data from a broader qualitative data set and primary data from telephone interviews. Findings show a positive relationship between collaboration on student attainment and highlight key conditions that need to be met, as well as particular difficulties of rural networks related to size and distance.

Abstract = {Anxiety disorders are common and impairing in childhood and adolescence. Cognitive bias modification of interpretations (CBM-I) training aims to alter information biases associated with anxiety disorders by training the person to endorse benign, rather than negative, interpretations of ambiguous situations. With an expanding evidence base, CBM-I training in childhood and adolescence may provide a key opportunity to prevent the development of anxiety disorders, particularly by capitalizing on the inherent flexibility of the adolescent brain to make durable changes. This article augments existing data with a reanalysis of a large sample of data (N = 387). The reanalysis highlights that CBM-I is (a) effective in altering interpretation styles; (b) that changes in mood state, although weak, are evident; and (c) tentatively, that effectiveness may vary across age in males and females. We conclude by offering further suggestions on which factors associated with protocol (e.g., multiple sessions) and training package (e.g., use of imagery) may maximize training effectiveness.

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to identify general and syndrome-specific deficits in the lexical processing of individuals with non-fluent and fluent aphasia compared to individuals without cognitive, neurological or language impairments. The time course of lexical access, as well as lexical selection and integration was studied using a visual-world paradigm in three groups of Russian speakers: 36 individuals in the control group, 15 individuals with non-fluent aphasia and eight individuals with fluent aphasia. Participants listened to temporarily ambiguous sentences wherein the context biased the interpretation of an ambiguous word toward one of its two meanings. In half of the experimental sentences, a reanalysis was needed upon encountering the disambiguating phrase. The effect of the length of the intervening material between the ambiguous word and the disambiguation point was additionally monitored. All groups of participants showed intact lexical access under slowed speech rate, but non-fluent participants experienced difficulties with timely activation of multiple referents. At later stages of lexical processing, they additionally demonstrated a specific impairment of reanalysis. The deficit in participants with fluent aphasia was not focalized at any specific stage of lexical processing. Rather, the breakdown of lexical processes in fluent aphasia was likely related to difficulties with the inhibition of irrelevant lexical activation, which is further supported by the finding that increased phonological distance between the ambiguous word and ambiguity resolution was influential to the offline performance in this group.

Abstract = {It has long been recognized that many instances of change that have been discussed within the framework of grammaticalization studies notoriously defy categorization, for instance because they share properties of grammaticalization and lexicalization (Brinton & Traugott 2005), or because they share some properties of grammaticalization, but not all of them, as in the case of discourse markers (e.g. Ocampo 2006). In order to avoid these classification issues, we will argue that it is more useful to reduce grammaticalization and related changes to their “main mechanisms” (formal reanalysis and semantic reinterpretation), “primitive changes” (micro-changes on the levels of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and/or discourse), and “side effects” (e.g. obligatorification or layering). In grammaticalization and related changes, formal reanalysis and semantic reinterpretation tend to coincide with different sets of primitive changes. Primitive changes will be defined as ternary parameters with the values reduction, expansion, or zero, and it will be seen that they tend to cluster in different ways. Some of these clusters may coincide with changes traditionally labeled “grammaticalization”, “degrammaticalization”, or “lexicalization”, but changes may also cluster in alternative ways. This novel approach to composite changes we term the “clustering approach”, and we aim to show that this model of analysis allows for a more fine-grained account of composite changes than definition-based taxonomies.

Abstract = {Importance: Reanalyses of randomized clinical trial (RCT) data may help the scientific community assess the validity of reported trial results. Objectives: To identify published reanalyses of RCT data, to characterize methodological and other differences between the original trial and reanalysis, to evaluate the independence of authors performing the reanalyses, and to assess whether the reanalysis changed interpretations from the original article about the types or numbers of patients who should be treated. Design: We completed an electronic search of MEDLINE from inception to March 9, 2014, to identify all published studies that completed a reanalysis of individual patient data from previously published RCTs addressing the same hypothesis as the original RCT. Four data extractors independently screened articles and extracted data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in direction and magnitude of treatment effect, statistical significance, and interpretation about the types or numbers of patients who should be treated. Results: We identified 37 eligible reanalyses in 36 published articles, 5 of which were performed by entirely independent authors (2 based on publicly available data and 2 on data that were provided on request; data availability was unclear for 1). Reanalyses differed most commonly in statistical or analytical approaches (n = 18) and in definitions or measurements of the outcome of interest (n = 12). Four reanalyses changed the direction and 2 changed the magnitude of treatment effect, whereas 4 led to changes in statistical significance of findings. Thirteen reanalyses (35%) led to interpretations different from that of the original article, 3 (8%) showing that different patients should be treated; 1 (3%), that fewer patients should be treated; and 9 (24%), that more patients should be treated. Conclusions and Relevance: A small number of reanalyses of RCTs have been published to date. Only a few were conducted by entirely independent authors. Thirty-five percent of published reanalyses led to changes in findings that implied conclusions different from those of the original article about the types and number of patients who should be treated.

Abstract = {Sighted animals must survive in an environment that is diverse yet highly structured. Neural-coding models predict that the visual system should allocate its computational resources to exploit regularities in the environment, and that this allocation should facilitate perceptual judgments. Here we use three approaches (natural scenes statistical analysis, a reanalysis of single-unit data from alert behaving macaque, and a behavioral experiment in humans) to address the question of how the visual system maximizes behavioral success by taking advantage of low-level regularities in the environment. An analysis of natural scene statistics reveals that the probability distributions for light increments and decrements are biased in a way that could be exploited by the visual system to estimate depth from relative luminance. A reanalysis of neurophysiology data from Samonds et al. (2012) shows that the previously reported joint tuning of V1 cells for relative luminance and binocular disparity is well matched to a predicted distribution of binocular disparities produced by natural scenes. Finally, we show that a percept of added depth can be elicited in images by exaggerating the correlation between luminance and depth. Together, the results from these three approaches provide further evidence that the visual system allocates its processing resources in a way that is driven by the statistics of the natural environment.

Abstract = {Comments on the original article by Johnson (see record [rid]2000-15714-001[/rid]) regarding relative weights method for assessing variable importance. This article provides a reanalysis of J. W. Johnson's (2000) “relative weights” method for assessing variable importance in multiple regression. The primary conclusion of the reanalysis is that the derivation of the method is theoretically flawed and has no more validity than the discredited method of Green, Carroll, and DeSarbo (1978) on which it is based. By means of 2 examples, supplemented by other results from the literature, it is also shown that the method can result in materially distorted inferences when it is compared with another widely used importance metric, namely, general dominance (Azen & Budescu, 2003; Budescu, 1993). Our primary recommendation is that J. W. Johnson's (2000) relative weights method should no longer be used as a variable importance metric for multiple linear regression. In the final section of the article, 2 additional recommendations are made based on our analysis, examples, and discussion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigates, through gap-filler processing in Mandarin Chinese, whether reanalysis is undertaken to fulfill semantic requirements, even at the expense of structural economy. The construction of interest is Verb + Noun1 + de + Noun2, which contains a subject gap and can be ambiguous between a left-branching (relative clause (RC)) and a right-branching (main clause or subject clause) analysis. In the RC analysis, N2 is the filler for the gap. In the right-branching analysis, the gap may co-refer with a noun in the main clause that follows N2 or is interpreted contextually. Sentence completion results showed that the right-branching analysis was initially preferred but the RC analysis increased substantially at the end of the construction. Self-paced reading results indicated that disambiguation in favor of the right-branching analysis in the sentence segment following V + N1 + de + N2 produced a longer reading time. These findings suggest that the Chinese parser will trade a structurally simpler (right-branching analysis) for a more complex analysis (RC) to provide a filler for an identified gap and therefore the semantic content for an argument. The overall implication is a human sentence processor allows for reanalysis if it can produce a more meaningful output. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Previous research reported that in processing structurally ambiguous sentences comprehenders often preserve an initial incorrect analysis even after adopting a correct analysis following structural disambiguation. One criticism is that the sentences tested in previous studies involved referential ambiguity and allowed comprehenders to make inferences about the initial interpretation using pragmatic information, suggesting the possibility that the initial analysis persisted due to comprehenders' pragmatic inference but not to their failure to perform complete reanalysis of the initial misanalysis. Our study investigated this by testing locally ambiguous relative clause sentences in Japanese, in which the initial misinterpretation contradicts the correct interpretation. Our study using a self‐paced reading technique demonstrated evidence for the persistence of the initial analysis with this structure. The results from an eye‐tracking study further suggested that the phenomenon directly reflected the amount of support given to the initial incorrect analysis prior to disambiguating information: The more supported the incorrect main clause analysis was, the more likely comprehenders were to preserve the analysis even after the analysis was falsified. Our results thus demonstrated that the preservation of the initial analysis occurs not due to referential ambiguities but to comprehenders' difficulty to fully revise the highly supported initial interpretation.

Abstract = {Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited small artery disease caused by NOTCH3 gene mutation. Here we report clinical, pathological and genetic profiles of 29 newly-diagnosed CADASIL patients, evaluation of the CADASIL scale in Chinese CADASIL patients, and reanalysis of all reported mainland Chinese patients with identified NOTCH3 gene mutation. We found two novel mutations (p.C134G and p.C291Y) and 13 reported NOTCH3 mutations in the newly-diagnosed group. CADASIL scale score was less than the cutoff score in 19 of 53 Chinese patients with NOTCH3 mutation, generating only a sensitivity of 64.1%. At the time of study, the total number of genetically confirmed CADASIL cases reached 158 from 97 unrelated mainland Chinese families, with 9/97 (9.3%) sporadic patients. The NOTCH3 gene mutation profile showed 43 mutations, with hotspots in exon 4, followed by exon 3. The considerable variability in onset age and CADASIL scale score in patients carrying the same NOTCH3 missense mutation suggested no obvious phenotype–genotype correlation. In conclusion, we report two novel mutations which expand the NOTCH3 mutational spectrum. Exons 4 and 3 are hotspots in mainland Chinese patients with NOTCH3 mutation. The low sensitivity of CADASIL scale in our patients group indicated that the CADASIL scale should be refined according to the clinical characteristics of Chinese CADASIL patients when used in Chinese populations.

Abstract = {Growing evidence in the last decade suggest significant role of immune alterations in the pathogenesis of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Cytokines, mediators of inflammation, alter the neurotransmitter concentration and result in a hyposerotonergic and hyperglutamatergic state implicated in pathogenesis of OCD. However, only few studies have examined cytokine abnormalities in OCD with inconsistent results possibly due to confounding effects of medications and comorbid anxiety–depression. We examined 20 comorbidity free, drug free OCD patients and 20 age and sex matched healthy controls. Clinical severity was assessed using Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Hamilton anxiety rating scale, Hamilton depression rating scale and Clinical Global Impression. Levels of different cytokines, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and Interferon (IFN)-γ were assessed using Cytometric Bead Array. OCD patients had significantly greater plasma levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α levels than controls but not IFN-γ. Reanalysis of data with only drug naïve patients (excluding 4 drug free patients) did not alter the results. Presence of these abnormalities in drug-naïve patients suggests the possible role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of OCD. Study findings have potential clinical utility in development of novel therapeutic options targeting cytokine aberrations in OCD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Comments on an article by B. E. Kok et al. (see record [rid]2013-25504-006[/rid]). Kok et al. claimed to have demonstrated that practicing loving-kindness meditation (LKM) generates an “upward spiral” of mutual enhancement among positive emotions, social connectedness, and physical health, the latter being indexed by vagal nerve tone (VNT). Kok et al. hypothesized that participants in the LKM group would show greater increases in positive emotions than those in the control group, and that this effect would be moderated by initial high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV). They further hypothesized that increased positive emotions would lead to increased perceptions of social connections, which in turn would lead to increased end-point HF-HRV, a series of effects that they described as an “upward spiral.” These hypotheses were represented by what Kok et al. described as a “variant of a mediational, parallel-process, latent curve model” which can be considered a mediated moderation model with positive emotions and social connectedness as mediators. Kok et al. relied on HF-HRV as a proxy for VNT, which they in turn interpreted as a surrogate measure for physical health. However, many researchers have cautioned against using VNT as an index of physical health because of its complexity and ambiguous clinical significance. Without a significant positive main effect of LKM on change in HF-HRV, the principal claim that positive emotions enhance physical health and the bold assertion that perceived positive social connections account for an upward spiral between positive emotions and VNT are unsupported by our reanalysis: There appears to be no upward spiral to be explained.

Abstract = {The primary goal of this article is to demonstrate the close relationship between 2 classes of dynamic models in psychological research: latent change score models and continuous time models. The secondary goal is to point out some differences. We begin with a brief review of both approaches, before demonstrating how the 2 methods are mathematically and conceptually related. It will be shown that most commonly used latent change score models are related to continuous time models by the difference equation approximation to the differential equation. One way in which the 2 approaches differ is the treatment of time. Whereas there are theoretical and practical restrictions regarding observation time points and intervals in latent change score models, no such limitations exist in continuous time models. We illustrate our arguments with three simulated data sets using a univariate and bivariate model with equal and unequal time intervals. As a by-product of this comparison, we discuss the use of phantom and definition variables to account for varying time intervals in latent change score models. We end with a reanalysis of the Bradway–McArdle longitudinal study on intellectual abilities (used before by McArdle & Hamagami, 2004) by means of the proportional change score model and the dual change score model in discrete and continuous time.

Abstract = {Abstract Perceiving one's deviance from the majority usually instigates conformal adjustments of one's own behavior to that of the group. Using ERPs, we investigated the mechanisms by which agreeing and disagreeing with the majority are differentially represented in the human brain and affect subsequent cognitive processing. Replicating previous findings obtained in a slightly different paradigm, we found that learning about one's disagreement with the majority, as compared to learning about one's agreement with the majority, elicited a mediofrontal feedback negativity. Moreover, an enhanced posterior late positive complex was observed during the processing of agreement as compared to disagreement. Finally, when the to‐be‐judged faces were viewed for a second time, a stronger posterior P2 was observed for faces on whose judgment one had previously agreed with the majority than for those on which one had disagreed. We thus demonstrate that the brain places particular emphasis on the encoding of the rewarding experience of finding strong social proof for one's judgments. Likewise, having experienced agreement on the judgment of a certain item affects even the later reanalysis of this very item, as previous agreement increases early attention, as reflected in the P2. These findings corroborate and extend previous results and theories on the neurocognitive principles of social influence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty generalizing—i.e., relating new stimuli to past experiences. Few experimental studies have addressed this weakness, despite its impact on intervention effects. In a reanalysis of data (de Marchena et al. Cognition 119(1):96–113, 2011), we tested a novel form of generalization—the ability to transfer a strategy used in one context to a similar context—in verbally fluent youth with ASD and matched typically developing controls. Participants with ASD were subtly less likely to learn from experience; their generalizations were less consistent. Generalization in ASD correlated with receptive vocabulary but not age, suggesting a link to language development. A richer understanding of how to promote generalization in ASD will advance both theory and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of non-significant intention–behavior effects in educational technology adoption, based on a reanalysis of data from the Impact09 project, a UK-government funded evaluation of technology use in high schools in England that had been selected as representing outstanding Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) innovation. The reanalysis focuses on intentionality and teleology, and attempts to combine an ecological perspective with a critical analysis of the intention– behavior correlations among participants, particularly teachers and head teachers. The concept of self-regulation is also considered as a determinant of behavior. The study reports a qualitative analysis of extensive interview data from four schools, and makes use of Underwood’s concept of ‘linkage e-maturity’. Traditional models of technology acceptance often assumed a steady trajectory of innovation, but such studies failed to explain uneven patterns of adoption. In this reanalysis, an emphasis on learning practices and e-maturity, interpreted within local and system-wide ecological contexts, better explained uneven adoption patterns.

Abstract = {How much overall variance in fluid intelligence (Gf) can be predicted by four working memory (WM) functions: storage capacity, attention control, relational integration, and updating was investigated under time pressured Gf testing. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the broad WM factor, which was subsumed by these four WM functions, shared 83.4% of variance with Gf tested under pressure, whereas a reanalysis of previous data with the same model showed that only 58.2% variance was shared with virtually untimed Gf tests. Moreover, in timed Gf tests, only the easiest, early items contributed to the WM-Gf correlation, whereas in untimed tests also the hardest, late items were linked with Gf. These results suggest that the measurement of "fast" intelligence primarily taps the functions of WM, whereas “slow(er)” intelligence depends also on some other cognitive processes beyond WM.

Abstract = {Background: International Remission Criteria (IRC) for schizophrenia were developed recently by a group of internationally known experts. The IRC detect only 10%–30% of cases and do not cover the diversity of forms and social functioning. Our aim was to design a more applicable tool and validate its use—the Standardized Clinical and Functional Remission Criteria (SCFRC). Methods: We used a 6-month follow-up study of 203 outpatients from two Moscow centers and another further sample of stable patients from a 1-year controlled trial of atypical versus typical medication. Diagnosis was confirmed by International Classification of Diseases Version 10 (ICD10) criteria and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Patients were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, including intensity threshold, and further classified using the Russian domestic remission criteria and the level of social and personal functioning, according to the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The SCFRC were formulated and were validated by a data reanalysis on the first population sample and on a second independent sample (104 patients) and in an open-label prospective randomized 12-month comparative study of risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) versus olanzapine. Results: Only 64 of the 203 outpatients (31.5%) initially met the IRC, and 53 patients (26.1%) met the IRC after 6 months, without a change in treatment. Patients who were in remission had episodic and progressive deficit (39.6%), or remittent (15%) paranoid schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder (17%). In addition, 105 patients of 139 (51.7%), who did not meet symptomatic IRC, remained stable within the period. Reanalysis of data revealed that 65.5% of the patients met the SCFRC. In the controlled trial, 70% of patients in the RLAI group met the SCFRC and only 19% the IRC. In the routine treatment group, 55.9% met the SCFRC and only 5.7% the IRC. Results of the further independent sample demonstrated that 35% met the IRC, 65% the SCFRC, and 56% of patients met both the symptomatic and functional criteria. In the controlled trial of RLAI and olanzapine, 40% and 35% of patients, respectively, met the IRC, while 70% and 55%, respectively, met the SCFRC. Conclusion: In schizophrenia outpatients, a greater proportion of stable cases is detected in remission by SCFRC in comparison with IRC. The SCFRC were more sensitive to the full spectrum of schizophrenia. The SCFRC appear to be valid as a tool and clinically useful as they produce a comprehensive assessment of treatment effectiveness for a wide range of patients.

Our rejoinder argues that Respondents misunderstand our method, raise "ecological fallacy" objections that do not apply to our population-level study, and counter with a reanalysis that includes only limited ages and inadequate method to assess socioeconomic factors in crime and risk taking by age. Our examination of Respondents’ reanalysis and citations finds further support for our finding that the "age-crime" curve is an artifact of demographic and disadvantage disparities, not "adolescent risk taking."

Abstract = {To make a scientific contribution, a reanalysis must be firmly rooted in the identification of a clearly superior methodological innovation over the original research. By contrast, a reanalysis rooted in dissatisfaction with previous results will necessarily be biased and can only obscure scientific discoveries. The reanalysis published by Ferguson and Donnellan (2014) began with a highly selective literature review, failed to justify its methodological choices, and interpreted its results in an incautious way. Notwithstanding these problems, the Ferguson and Donnellan article leaves intact the core contributions of the original article: that there is no evidence of a positive effect of infant viewing on subsequent development and that it is well worth conducting more research on the effects—including potentially adverse effects—of infant TV, DVD, and video viewing.

Abstract = {A small number of facial expressions may be universal in that they are produced by the same basic affective states and recognized as such throughout the world. However, other aspects of emotionally expressive behavior vary widely across culture. Just why do they vary? We propose that some cultural differences in expressive behavior are determined by historical heterogeneity, or the extent to which a country’s present-day population descended from migration from numerous vs. few source countries over a period of 500 y. Our reanalysis of data on cultural rules for displaying emotion from 32 countries [n = 5,340; Matsumoto D, Yoo S, Fontaine J (2008) J Cross Cult Psychol 39(1):55–74] reveals that historical heterogeneity explains substantial, unique variance in the degree to which individuals believe that emotions should be openly expressed. We also report an original study of the underlying states that people believe are signified by a smile. Cluster analysis applied to data from nine countries (n = 726), including Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States, reveals that countries group into “cultures of smiling” determined by historical heterogeneity. Factor analysis shows that smiles sort into three social-functional subtypes: pleasure, affiliative, and dominance. The relative importance of these smile subtypes varies as a function of historical heterogeneity. These findings thus highlight the power of socialhistorical factors to explain cross-cultural variation in emotional expression and smile behavior.

Abstract = {Comments on and reanalyzes survey data sets of Lewandowsky, Oberauer, and Gignac (see record [rid]2013-16937-003[/rid]) and Lewandowsky, Gignac, and Oberauer (2013). The reanalysis of the survey data sets indicates that the conclusions of those articles—that conspiracist ideation predicts skepticism regarding the reality of anthropogenic climate change—are not supported by the data. Nonlinear relationships were overlooked in both analyses, and this resulted in model misspecification. The authors used structural equation modeling (SEM) assuming linear relationships between the variables, and it is essential to test this assumption (Bentler & Chou, 1987, p. 86; Ullman, 2007, p. 683). In this Commentary, we show, using nonparametric local regression, that this assumption does not hold for the relationship between conspiracist ideation and views on climate science, the relationship that produced one of the central claims of both articles and the majority of the press interest (e.g., Corner, 2012; Pearlman, 2012).

Abstract = {Pacton and Perruchet (2008) reported that participants who were asked to process adjacent elements located within a sequence of digits learned adjacent dependencies but did not learn nonadjacent dependencies and conversely, participants who were asked to process nonadjacent digits learned nonadjacent dependencies but did not learn adjacent dependencies. In the present study, we showed that when participants were simply asked to read aloud the same sequences of digits, a task demand that did not require the intentional processing of specific elements as in standard statistical learning tasks, only adjacent dependencies were learned. The very same pattern was observed when digits were replaced by syllables. These results show that the perfect symmetry found in Pacton and Perruchet was not due to the fact that the processing of digits is less sensitive to their distance than the processing of syllables, tones, or visual shapes used in most statistical learning tasks. Moreover, the present results, completed with a reanalysis of the data collected in Pacton and Perruchet (2008), demonstrate that participants are highly sensitive to violations involving the spacing between paired elements. Overall, these results are consistent with the Pacton and Perruchet's single-process account of adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies, in which the joint attentional processing of the two events is a necessary and sufficient condition for learning the relation between them, irrespective of their distance. However, this account should be completed to encompass the notion that the presence or absence of an intermediate event is an intrinsic component of the representation of an association.

Abstract = {Objective: A study was undertaken to test in a subgroup reanalysis of the URICO-ICTUS trial whether uric acid is superior to placebo in improving the functional outcome in patients with acute stroke and hyperglycemia. Methods: Patients were part of the URICO-ICTUS trial, a double-blind study that compared the administration of uric acid versus placebo in stroke patients treated with alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset. The effect of therapy on the rate of excellent outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) in each tertile of admission glucose was assessed with multivariate adjusted models in 409 of the 421 randomized patients who had available pretreatment glucose levels. The effect of therapy on infarct growth was assessed in 72 patients who had longitudinal multimodal brain imaging. Results: Uric acid was associated with an increased rate of excellent outcome in patients with glucose levels in the upper tertile range (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0–8.3). However, the effect was not apparent for patients in the middle tertile (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.8–3.6) or lower tertile of glucose (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.5–2.6). Uric acid therapy was more effective than placebo in limiting infarct growth in the upper tertile range (Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.04) but not in the middle tertile (p = 0.95) or lower tertile of glucose (p = 0.30). Uric acid also proved superior to placebo in reducing infarct growth in patients with early recanalization. Interpretation: Uric acid therapy was associated with reduced infarct growth and improved outcome in patients with hyperglycemia during acute stroke.

Abstract = {Similarities in the development of locomotion between young children and other mammals are explored by reanalysis of data accrued over ∼18 years. Supported stepping in children was tested on a treadmill. Although the time course of development is more protracted in humans compared to other mammals, the same trends are seen. For example, the duration of the stepping cycle shortens rapidly in the first 5 months of life. Hypermetric flexion of the hip and knee during stepping is seen in children < 3 mo old. Stability of the locomotor rhythm both with respect to cycle duration within a limb and coupling between limbs improves slowly. Finally, coordination between the left and right legs can be manipulated with training, indicating experience‐dependent learning at a young age. The possible reasons for these remarkably similar trends in development are explored as a function of maturational time tables for neural structures.

Abstract = {Whole brain irradiation remains important in the management of brain tumors. Although necessary for improving survival outcomes, cranial irradiation also results in cognitive decline in long‐term survivors. A chronic inflammatory state characterized by microglial activation has been implicated in radiation‐induced brain injury. We here provide the first comprehensive transcriptional profile of irradiated microglia. Fluorescence‐activated cell sorting was used to isolate CD11b+ microglia from the hippocampi of C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice 1 month after 10 Gy cranial irradiation. Affymetrix gene expression profiles were evaluated using linear modeling and rank product analyses. One month after irradiation, a conserved irradiation signature across strains was identified, comprising 448 and 85 differentially up‐ and downregulated genes, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated enrichment for inflammation, including M1 macrophage‐associated genes, but also an unexpected enrichment for extracellular matrix and blood coagulation‐related gene sets, in contrast previously described microglial states. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis confirmed these findings and further revealed alterations in mitochondrial function. The RNA‐seq transcriptome of microglia 24‐h postradiation proved similar to the 1‐month transcriptome, but additionally featured alterations in apoptotic and lysosomal gene expression. Reanalysis of published aging mouse microglia transcriptome data demonstrated striking similarity to the 1‐month irradiated microglia transcriptome, suggesting that shared mechanisms may underlie aging and chronic irradiation‐induced cognitive decline.

Abstract = {Henson (1996) provided a number of demonstrations of error patterns in serial recall that contradict chaining models. Chaining models predict that when participants erroneously recall an item too early, recall should proceed from the point of error. In contradiction to such a prediction, Henson found evidence for a fill-in effect: participants were much more likely to revisit an erroneously skipped item than to continue onward to later list items. However, recent reanalyses of serial recall data sets have found evidence for the opposite pattern in serial recall experiments that use open sets of items. We tested the hypothesis that open sets of items produce fill-in effects by comparing serial recall with an open set and a closed set, and when participants were allowed and prohibited from skipping over responses, and comparing serial recall with a reconstruction of order task. Fill-in effects were observed in all cases except when participants were not encouraged to skip over responses. Subsequent analyses indicated that when omission rates were equated, a fill-in effect was observed for all conditions when lists contained no omissions. These results suggest that high omission rates in open-set designs obscure a fill-in effect and further sound a cautionary note about interpreting cases in which recall continues in the forward direction after a skipped response.

Abstract = {Aim: Changes in the employment status of clients in inpatient and outpatient treatment from the years 2007-2011 are described and unemployment rates of selected main diagnosis (MD) are compared to each other. Furthermore, for the year 2009, we compared the sociodemographic and epidemiological data of clients receiving unemployment benefits in accordance with SGB 11 or SGB 111 (ALO), with those of clients not receiving ALO benefits. Methods: This contribution represents a reanalysis on data of clients taken from the annual German addiction treatment statistics (Deulsche Suchthilfestatistik, DSHS). The number of observed cases per annum ranges from 107.041 from 720 (2007) lo 155.276 from 779 (2009) outpatient centers and from 24,586 from 147 (2007) to 39.329 from 189 (2010) inpatient centers. An additional dataset from the year 2009 which includes only those clients who had received A LO in the 6 months previous to treatment, consists of 55.479 cases from 779 outpatient centers and 14.990 cases from 157 inpatient centers. Results: The unemployment rate among clients in outpatient settings decreased by 1 % between 2007 and 2011 (2011: 39.1 %) and increased by 1 % in inpatient setting (2011: 4S.5 % ). The highest proportion of unemployment was found among clients with MD opioids (outpatient: 59.9 % inpatient: 64.7 % ) . In all MD analyzed the percentage of clients receiving unemployment benefits in accordance with SGB II far exceeds that of clients receiving benefits in accordance with SGB 111 (for at least 80 % lo 20 %). The largest change was found among clients with MD stimulants from inpatient services (+13.7 %). A comparison between clients with and without ALO benefits, based on the DSHS data from 2009, revealed that clients with ALO benefits show higher rates considering the following variables as compared to clients without ALO benefits: living alone and in precarious living situations, having a problematic debt history, and having no vocational or higher education. Additionally, the rate of previously treated clients was higher among clients with ALO benefits, whereas the proportion of regular terminated treatments was lower. Conclusion: The unemployment rate increased considerably in particular among clients with MD stimulants from inpatient centers. The present data show that social problems seem to be more pronounced among unemployed clients than among clients without ALO benefits. Indicators for relapse rates (retreatment) also seem lo indicate a poorer prognosis for these clients. Therefore, on the one hand, programs for (re)integration into the labor market, such as trainings or addiction-prevention interventions should be maintained or adapted. On the other hand, special relapse-prevention interventions could be filling for clients without any career prospects. A more intensive cooperation between treatment centers, (vocational) schools, employment centers, job centers, debt counseling as well as youth and social welfare offices could prove lo be valuable.

Abstract = {Greenwald, Banaji, and Nosek (2015) present a reanalysis of the meta-analysis by Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, and Tetlock (2013) that examined the effect sizes of Implicit Association Tests (IATs) designed to predict racial and ethnic discrimination. We discuss points of agreement and disagreement with respect to methods used to synthesize the IAT studies, and we correct an error by Greenwald et al. that obscures a key contribution of our meta-analysis. In the end, all of the meta-analyses converge on the conclusion that, across diverse methods of coding and analyzing the data, IAT scores are not good predictors of ethnic or racial discrimination, and explain, at most, small fractions of the variance in discriminatory behavior in controlled laboratory settings. The thought experiments presented by Greenwald et al. go well beyond the lab to claim systematic IAT effects in noisy real-world settings, but these hypothetical exercises depend crucially on untested and, arguably, untenable assumptions.

Abstract = {Problem: In several countries, physical activity is now recommended in clinical practice guidelines as an option for the treatment of subthreshold, mild, and moderate adult depression. However, most physicians do not present this option to their patients, attributing their decision to the perception that the supporting research evidence is inadequate. To assist readers in developing a strategy for evaluating pertinent research evidence, the present analysis offers a critical appraisal of the Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effects of exercise on depression. Remarkably, successive updates of this review have reported a gradual “shrinkage” of the pooled standardized mean difference associated with exercise by 44%, from −1.10 in 2001 to −0.62 in 2013. Method: The analysis evaluated the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the uniformity of rules, the rationale behind protocol changes, the procedures followed in assessing methodological quality, and reporting errors. Results: Inspection of the details of the review demystifies the “shrinkage” phenomenon, revealing that it is attributable to specific, questionable methodological choices and the fluidity of the review protocol. Reanalysis of the same database following rational modifications shows that the effect of exercise is large. Restricting the analysis to high-quality trials yields an effect size significantly different from zero. Conclusions: Although the clinical value of the Cochrane review is questionable, its educational potential is undeniable. Clinicians, students, referees, editors, systematic reviewers, guideline developers, and policymakers can use the present analysis as a template for evaluating the influence of methodological choices on the conclusions of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Abstract = {We probed the developmental and behavioral consequences of a single episode of kainic acid-induced early-life seizures (KA-ELS) in the rat on postnatal day 7. Correlates of developmental trajectory were not altered, demonstrating that long-term consequences following KA-ELS are not initiated by secondary causes, such as malnourishment or alterations in maternal care. We report reduced marble burying in adult rats, suggestive of restricted interests, a trait common to experimental and clinical autism. We did not detect increased repetitive grooming during habituated cage behavior. However, we did detect reduced grooming in adult KA-ELS rats in the presence of an unfamiliar rat, supporting altered social anxiety following KA-ELS. Reanalysis of a social approach task further indicated abnormal social interactions. Taken together with previous physiological and behavioral data, these data support the hypothesis that KA-ELS lead to a latent autistic phenotype in adult rats not attributable to other early alterations in development.

Abstract = {Responds to an article by Sauter, Eisner, Ekman, and Scott (see record [rid]2015-11687-011[/rid]) on the original article by Gendron et al. (see record [rid]2014-13629-007[/rid]) . We recently published results of two experiments (Gendron, Roberson, van der Vyver, & Barrett, 2014a) showing that emotions were not universally perceived in vocalizations. We traveled to remote locations in Namibia and sampled participants from the Himba cultural group. Participants in Study 1 listened to vocalizations and freely labeled them. Participants in Study 2 followed a forcedchoice procedure similar to that reported by Sauter, Eisner, Ekman and Scott (2010); on each trial, they had to choose which of two vocalizations (a target and a foil) matched a brief emotional story (embedded with emotion words). Refining Sauter et al.’s finding that Himba perceivers performed above chance in choosing vocalizations to match story and word cues, we observed that Himba individuals correctly perceived vocalizations according to their positivity or negativity (i.e., valence), but not their presumed universal emotion categories (e.g., anger or fear). Our finding replicated the results of our free-labeling study (Study 1), as well as other data showing that Himba participants perceive valence, but not Western discrete emotion categories, in posed facial expressions (Gendron, Roberson, van der Vyver, & Barrett, 2014b). In their Commentary, Sauter, Eisner, Ekman, and Scott (2015) report that a reanalysis of their data rules out valence as an alternative to their interpretation that their findings support universal emotion perception. They also suggest two reasons why we did not replicate their findings. We appreciate the opportunity to respond and offer three suggestions of our own that question their conclusions and details of the experimental method that they have now elaborated on.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Gendron et al. (see record [rid]2014-13629-007[/rid]). The question of whether emotional expressions have universal meanings has been at the center of heated debates for many decades (e.g., Ekman, 1994; Russell, 1994). In a recent contribution, Gendron, Roberson, van der Vyver, and Barrett (2014) took issue with our study of emotional vocalizations, in which we claimed to show that some nonverbal sounds reliably communicate emotional states across cultures (Sauter, Eisner, Ekman, & Scott, 2010). In their Study 2, Gendron et al. replicated part of our study (Himba listeners hearing British vocalizations), but analyzed their data in terms of the valance and arousal of the distractors. They found that recognition was not better than chance for most types of distractors and concluded that emotional vocalizations signal valence, but not specific emotions. We welcome their attempted partial replication of our work. Their article has impelled us to reanalyze our original data in more depth. However, given the results of our reanalysis, together with alternative explanations for the results Gendron et al. obtained, we find that their conclusion does not hold. In conclusion, we have presented new analyses that show that nonverbal vocalizations communicate specific emotional states, regardless of the valence of the distractor with which they are presented. Furthermore, we have proposed alternative explanations for the failure of Gendron et al. to find this pattern in their data. We hope that this contribution will serve as a useful addition to the debate on what information can be inferred from emotional expressions cross-culturally.

Abstract = {The current study, which was a reanalysis of previous data, focused on the error-related negativity (ERN)—an event-related potential (ERP) associated with error monitoring—and the feedback negativity (FN)—an ERP associated with reward processing. Two objectives motivated this study: first, to illustrate the relationship between the ERN and anxious symptoms, and the relationship between the FN and depressive symptoms; second, to explore whether the ERN and the FN relate uniquely to anxiety and depression, respectively, in children. EEG was collected from twenty-five 11- to 13-year-old participants (12 female; 23 Caucasian, 1 Asian, 1 of Caucasian and Hispanic ethnicity) during tasks designed to elicit an ERN and an FN. Participants and a parent completed questionnaires assessing the participant's anxious and depressive symptomatology. Increasing anxiety was related to a larger ERN, and increasing depression was related to a smaller FN. Further analysis demonstrated that these relationships remained significant when controlling for the contribution of other variables; that is, the ERN continued to predict anxiety when controlling for the FN and depression, and the FN continued to predict depression when controlling for the ERN and anxiety. Thus, in late childhood and early adolescence, the ERN and the FN appear to relate uniquely to anxious and depressive symptoms, respectively. Although this research is still in early stages, the ERN and the FN have the potential to inform trajectories of risk for anxiety and depression, and could be utilized in clinical settings as cost- and labor-efficient neural biomarkers.

Abstract = {It has been commonplace in the deception literature to assert the pervasive nature of deception in communication practices. Previous studies of lie prevalence find that lying is unusual compared to honest communication. Recent research, and reanalysis of previous studies reporting the frequency of lies, shows that most people are honest most of the time and the majority of lies are told by a few prolific liars. The current article reports a statistical method for distinguishing prolific liars from everyday liars and provides a test of the few prolific liars finding by examining lying behavior in the United Kingdom. Participants (N = 2,980) were surveyed and asked to report on how often they told both little white lies and big important lies. Not surprisingly, white lies were more common than big lies. Results support and refine previous findings about the distinction between everyday and prolific liars, and implications for theory are discussed.

We present the results from a re-analysis of their results to illustrate the importance of measuring communicative language acts (formally called “speech acts”). Reanalysis confirmed that children in the MEHRIT group outperformed the community treatment group on measures of MLUm, number of utterances produced, and various speech act categories. The study underscores the importance of functional language measures in guiding and evaluating treatment for children with autism, and suggests that MEHRIT is effective in improving children’s use of language during parent–child interactions.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to illustrate the multilevel meta-analysis of results from single-subject experimental designs of different types, including AB phase designs, multiple-baseline designs, ABAB reversal designs, and alternating treatment designs. Current methodological work on the meta-analysis of single-subject experimental designs often focuses on combining simple AB phase designs or multiple-baseline designs. We discuss the estimation of the average intervention effect estimate across different types of single-subject experimental designs using several multilevel meta-analytic models. We illustrate the different models using a reanalysis of a meta-analysis of single-subject experimental designs (Heyvaert, Saenen, Maes, & Onghena, in press). The intervention effect estimates using univariate 3-level models differ from those obtained using a multivariate 3-level model that takes the dependence between effect sizes into account. Because different results are obtained and the multivariate model has multiple advantages, including more information and smaller standard errors, we recommend researchers to use the multivariate multilevel model to meta-analyze studies that utilize different single-subject designs.

The authors recently presented results from a series of analyses aimed at identifying the factor structure underlying the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) personality diagnoses assessed in the large NESARC study. Cox et al. (2012) concluded that the best fitting model was one that modeled three lower-order factors (the three clusters of PDs as outlined by DSM-IV-TR), which in turn loaded on a single PD higher-order factor. Our reanalyses of the NESARC Wave 1 and Wave 2 data for personality disorder diagnoses revealed that the best fitting model was that of a general PD factor that spans each of the ten DSM-IV PD diagnoses, and our reanalyses do not support the three-cluster hierarchical structure outlined by Cox et al. (2012) and DSM-IV-TR. Finally, we note the importance of modeling the Wave 2 assessment method factor in analyses of NESARC PD data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To reanalyse a web-based intervention for physically untrained office workers with sub-acute non-specific low back pain in low back pain-related exercise behaviour terms. Design: Reanalysis of a randomized controlled trial. Setting: Occupational Preventive Medicine of University. Methods: Participants were randomized to an intervention group (proposed intervention plus standard care) or a control group (usual care only). The intervention exercise and education materials were developed as an online resource, and included video demonstrations recorded in a laboratory. Resources were loaded onto a dedicated section of the University Preventive Medicine Service website. All sessions included stretching, and exercises to improve postural stability (abdominal, lumbar, hip and thigh muscles) strength, flexibility and mobility. Outcome measures were self-reported health status (visual analogue scale (VAS) of the Euroquol-5D questionnaire); functional health status (Oswestry disability questionnaire); and the stage of change questionnaire. At nine months, outcomes in the intervention group were analysed and compared with baseline and outcomes in controls. Results: In the intervention group, significant positive effects were observed at nine-month follow up for stage of change in the behavioural domain as related with low back pain for all phases except for the contemplation phase. The positive change in the stage of change questionnaire correlated with the improvement observed in Oswestry (r = .388) and VAS (r = −.612). Conclusions: The reanalysis of the trial suggests that exercise behaviour related to low back pain improve after the intervention period. This improvement correlates with changes in clinical low back pain-related outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Breen and Clifton (Stress matters: Effects of anticipated lexical stress on silent reading. Journal of Memory and Language, 2011, 64, 153–170) argued that readers’ eye movements during silent reading are influenced by the stress patterns of words. This claim was supported by the observation that syntactic reanalysis that required concurrent metrical reanalysis (e.g., a change from the noun form of abstract to the verb form) resulted in longer reading times than syntactic reanalysis that did not require metrical reanalysis (e.g., a change from the noun form of report to the verb form). However, the data contained a puzzle: The disruption appeared on the critical word (abstract, report) itself, although the material that forced the part of speech change did not appear until the next region. Breen and Clifton argued that parafoveal preview of the disambiguating material triggered the revision and that the eyes did not move on until a fully specified lexical representation of the critical word was achieved. The present experiment used a boundary change paradigm in which parafoveal preview of the disambiguating region was prevented. Once again, an interaction was observed: Syntactic reanalysis resulted in particularly long reading times when it also required metrical reanalysis. However, now the interaction did not appear on the critical word, but only following the disambiguating region. This pattern of results supports Breen and Clifton’s claim that readers form an implicit metrical representation of text during silent reading.

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that comprehension of complex sentences involving wh-movement (e.g., object-relative clauses) elicits activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left posterior temporal cortex. However, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of processing passive sentences, which differ from other complex sentences in terms of representation (i.e., noun phrase (NP)-movement) and processing (i.e., the time course of syntactic reanalysis). In the present study, 27 adults (14 younger and 13 older) listened to passive and active sentences and performed a sentence-picture verification task using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Passive sentences, relative to active sentences, elicited greater activation in bilateral IFG and left temporo-occipital regions. Participant age did not significantly affect patterns of activation. Consistent with previous research, activation in left temporo-occipital cortex likely reflects thematic reanalysis processes, whereas, activation in the left IFG supports processing of complex syntax (i.e., NP-movement). Right IFG activation may reflect syntactic reanalysis processing demands associated with the sentence-picture verification task. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Reanalysis accounting for electrode artifacts. The newly published Supplementary Figure 6 depicts normalized EPI scans from two DBS-implanted subjects illustrating that the nucleus accumbens ROI (red) and the region of signal dropout around the electrode are not overlapping. Nevertheless, we reanalyzed our data to further rule out the possibility that our results were affected by signal measured from the dropout region. We re-analyzed the data by removing the parts of the ROI that would extend into the electrode dropout region based on the normalized but unsmoothed functional images instead of T1-weighted scans. We then extracted the ROI time series from these unsmoothed images and correlated these with the smoothed remaining brain. Results from this reanalysis (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7) are similar to those of the first analysis—that is, DBS-induced decrease in functional connectivity between the NAc and mPFC/ lPFC—confirming that our results are unlikely to reflect false positives related to electrode artifacts.

Abstract = {A recent article in Neuroethics posited “bad news for conservatives,” on the basis of survey data collected on line. On the basis of bivariate correlations between self-reported conservatism/liberalism and a variety of moral propositions, the author inferred that those moral judgments were ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal.’ Then, based on a series of bivariate correlations between those same moral propositions and measures of “morally worrisome” personality characteristics, the author concluded that conservatives tended to have these morally worrisome characteristics. Unfortunately, the original article was replete with methodological and statistical errors. This paper presents a reanalysis of the data from the original article, using good statistical and methodological technique. The reanalysis suggests that there are some small but potentially theoretically meaningful relationships between some moral propositions and three morally worrisome (antisocial) personality characteristics. The data also suggest that these relationships can change substantially depending on other conditions, so should not yet be generalized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

In two eye tracking experiments, we distinguish between two types of incompleteness: the language comprehension system might not build a faithful syntactic structure, or it might not fully erase the structure built during an initial misparse. The first experiment used reflexive binding and the gender mismatch paradigm to show that a complete and faithful structure is built following processing of the garden-path. The second experiment used two-sentence texts to examine the extent to which the garden-path meaning from the first sentence interferes with reading of the second. Together, the results indicate that misinterpretation effects are attributable not to failure in building a proper structure, but rather to failure in cleaning up all remnants of earlier attempts to build that syntactic representation.

Abstract = {When asked to recall memories from their personal lives in response to word cues, adults older than 40 years report a significantly greater amount of memories from the time when they were 15–30 years old. This phenomenon is called the reminiscence bump. Cultural life story theory is a cultural explanation of the reminiscence bump. According to this account, the reminiscence bump is heavily influenced by the cultural life script—that is, shared expectations about the order and timing of life events in an ordinary life course. Life scripts locate a high proportion of major transitional life events in the second and third decades of life. The main purpose of this article was to review the empirical evidence and validity for the cultural life script theory. First, I describe the reminiscence bump and briefly mention the theories that attempt to explain why it occurs. Second, I describe the cultural life script theory and how the theory is related to autobiographical memories via life story events. Third, I describe the methodology that has been used to test the cultural life script theory. Finally, I provide a reanalysis of seven studies, based on the cultural life script theory conducted in four countries: Denmark, the USA, Turkey, and the Netherlands. As a part of this reanalysis, I examine the degree to which cultural life scripts guide recall of autobiographical memories by comparing the temporal distribution of life events obtained from the cultural life script (the cultural life script bump) and personal life story events (the reminiscence bump). Results of this reanalysis show that all life scripts across cultures have a lifespan distribution resembling the reminiscence bump. Furthermore, the distribution of the events of the life script generated by a group of old Danes in one of the studies resembles the distribution of their own life story events, suggesting that they used the information contained in the life script to retrieve personal memories.

Abstract = {Rationale: Noradrenaline interacts with stress hormones in the amygdala and hippocampus to enhance emotional memory consolidation, but the noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction at retrieval, where stress impairs memory, is less understood. Objectives: We used a genetic neuroimaging approach to investigate whether a genetic variation of the noradrenergic system impacts stress-induced neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus during recognition of emotional memory. Methods: This study is based on genotype-dependent reanalysis of data from our previous publication (Li et al. Brain Imaging Behav 2014). Twenty-two healthy male volunteers were genotyped for the ADRA2B gene encoding the α2B-adrenergic receptor. Ten deletion carriers and 12 noncarriers performed an emotional face recognition task, while their brain activity was measured with fMRI. During encoding, 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces were presented. One hour later, they underwent either an acute stress (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control procedure which was followed immediately by the retrieval session, where participants had to discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces. Results: A genotype-dependent modulation of neural activity at retrieval was found in the bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus. Deletion carriers showed decreased neural activity in the amygdala when recognizing emotional faces in control condition and increased amygdala activity under stress. Noncarriers showed no differences in emotional modulated amygdala activation under stress or control. Instead, stress-induced increases during recognition of emotional faces were present in the right hippocampus. Conclusion: The genotype-dependent effects of acute stress on neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus provide evidence for noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction in emotional memory retrieval.

The authors argue that Arkes has misinterpreted some results, misunderstood our research aim, and failed to acknowledge the importance of small effects. Kubota explain their results concerning White participants' earnings, response latency issues, the exclusion of rational responders and use of logistic model fitting, and magnitude of the effects. It is concluded that the purpose of the original study was to explore the role of the proposer’s race in the decision whether to reject an unfair monetary offer. Arkes’s personal interest in the White-only sample raises a legitimate question whether Whites are less biased than other groups, and this question is deserving of its own data gathering with substantive samples. As presented, his reanalysis supports our original conclusions. We thank Arkes for his interest in our work and remind readers that the claims in the original article hold as stated.

Abstract = {Coherent representation of action sequences implies that the logical temporal order of each action can be correctly represented. Violation of this logical order may induce a sort of expectancies disruption of the temporal structure. Thus the present study explored the event-related potential (ERP) effect related to the cortical response to this violation. Action sequence composed by four frames with final congruous or incongruous endings was submitted to 28 subjects. Two distinct ERP effects, feedback-related negativity (FRN), and P300, were found in response to incongruous endings, with also significant increased RTs. The functional significance of these two ERP deflections was related respectively to the perception of an erroneous action outcome as the ending of an illogical sequence (FRN) and to the necessity to updating the relationship action-context by changing the cognitive model which supports the cognitive expectancies (P300). The significant correlation between the RTs and the ERP measures, especially in case of FRN effect, supported this interpretation. Indeed increased cognitive costs are supposed in case of expectancies violations which require further processes of reanalysis of the coherence between the action and the background (the temporal background) where the action was produced. Two different cortical localizations were found for FRN and P300, respectively a more fronto-central (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and posterior (superior temporal gyrus) site. The significance of these results for the temporal order effect for action comprehension was discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Although neuroimaging research has made substantial progress in identifying the large-scale neural substrate of anxiety disorders, its value for clinical application lags behind expectations. Machine-learning approaches have predictive potential for individual-patient prognostic purposes and might thus aid translational efforts in psychiatric research. OBJECTIVE: To predict treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on an individual-patient level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 49 patients free of medication for at least 4 weeks and with a primary diagnosis of PD/AG in a longitudinal study performed at 8 clinical research institutes and outpatient centers across Germany. The functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted between July 2007 and March 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve CBT sessions conducted 2 times a week focusing on behavioral exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Treatment response was defined as exceeding a 50% reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Blood oxygenation level–dependent signal was measured during a differential fear-conditioning task. Regional and whole-brain gaussian process classifiers using a nested leave-one-out cross-validation were used to predict the treatment response from data acquired before CBT. RESULTS: Although no single brain region was predictive of treatment response, integrating regional classifiers based on data from the acquisition and the extinction phases of the fear-conditioning task for the whole brain yielded good predictive performance (accuracy, 82%; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 72%; P < .001). Data from the acquisition phase enabled 73%correct individual-patient classifications (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 67%; P < .001), whereas data from the extinction phase led to an accuracy of 74%(sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 83%; P < .001). Conservative reanalyses under consideration of potential confounders yielded nominally lower but comparable accuracy rates (acquisition phase, 70%; extinction phase, 71%; combined, 79%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Predicting treatment response to CBT based on functional neuroimaging data in PD/AG is possible with high accuracy on an individual-patient level. This novel machine-learning approach brings personalized medicine within reach, directly supporting clinical decisions for the selection of treatment options, thus helping to improve response rates.

Abstract = {Given major increases in the diagnosis of attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in rates of medication for this condition, we carefully examine evidence for effects of single versus multimodal (i.e., combined medication and psychosocial/behavioral) interventions for ADHD. Our primary data source is the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA), a 14‐month, randomized clinical trial in which intensive behavioral, medication, and multimodal treatment arms were contrasted with one another and with community intervention (treatment‐as‐usual), regarding outcome domains of ADHD symptoms, comorbidities, and core functional impairments. Although initial reports emphasized the superiority of well‐monitored medication for symptomatic improvement, reanalyses and reappraisals have highlighted (1) the superiority of combination treatment for composite outcomes and for domains of functional impairment (e.g., academic achievement, social skills, parenting practices); (2) the importance of considering moderator and mediator processes underlying differential patterns of outcome, including comorbid subgroups and improvements in family discipline style during the intervention period; (3) the emergence of side effects (e.g., mild growth suppression) in youth treated with long‐term medication; and (4) the diminution of medication's initial superiority once the randomly assigned treatment phase turned into naturalistic follow‐up. The key paradox is that while ADHD clearly responds to medication and behavioral treatment in the short term, evidence for long‐term effectiveness remains elusive. We close with discussion of future directions and a call for greater understanding of relevant developmental processes in the attempt to promote optimal, generalized, and lasting treatments for this important and impairing neurodevelopmental disorder.

Abstract = {This study revisits the theory, data, and analysis in Prentice and Woodside (2013). The study here applies fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to customer service–evaluation data from seven mega casinos in the world's gambling capital—Macau. The study includes contrarian case analysis and offers complex algorithms of highly favorable customer outcomes—an alternative stance to theory and data analysis in comparison to the dominant logic of statistical analyses that Prentice and Woodside (2013) report. Contrary to their principal hypotheses, Prentice and Woodside (2013) report a negative main effect between problem gambling and casino service evaluations. The findings in the reanalysis here include more complex, nuanced views on the antecedent conditions relating to high problem‐gambling, immediate service evaluations, and desired customer behavior measures in casinos. Counter to the findings using symmetric testing via multiple regression analysis in Prentice and Woodside (2013), the present study, using asymmetric testing via fsQCA, recognizes the occurrence of causal asymmetry, and draws conclusions from different algorithms leading to high scores for favorable and unfavorable outcome conditions. The findings indicate that not all problem gamblers gaze on casino services harshly; the minority of problem gamblers who view casinos positively versus harshly may be the most valuable customers for the casinos—the casinos’ exceptional customers.

Abstract = {The foundational research on blockmodeling focused on theorizing and identifying social roles and positions across multiple networks (White et al., 1976). Generalized blockmodeling provided a breakthrough in theory and research by permitting ideal block types that implement a wider class of role equivalence within a network (Doreian et al., 2005). Notwithstanding these successes and related progress that we discuss, a direct approach for the blockmodeling of multiple relations remains an open problem in the generalized blockmodeling literature (Doreian, 2006). With this in mind, we propose a simple and novel means of formulating and fitting generalized blockmodels for multiple relations. We make use of existing capabilities of the open-source network analysis software Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar, 2011; Mrvar and Batagelj, 2013). In particular, by constructing an appropriate augmented adjacency matrix and carefully crafted constraints and penalties, Pajek's criterion function can be simultaneously minimized over multiple relations. This technique is first described in detail using a hypothetical friendship network, and then its value is reinforced through reanalysis of a classic, real world example.

Abstract = {As with any personality measure dependent on self-report items, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® or MBTI® instrument is subject to unknown self-presentational bias reflecting presumed social desirability of responses and the ability to answer candidly and/or accurately. One strategy to improve accuracy employed in psychological type practice allows MBTI users to review their results and agree with or alter them to determine a “best-fit” type. This research compares three different measures of psychological type: best-fit results, MBTI results, and scores from a type measure based on the Implicit Association Test, or IAT (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), in order to illuminate potential bias in type measurement. Study 1 compared standard MBTI results for each of the four preference domains (E–I, S–N, T–F, and J–P) to results for the corresponding IAT measures. Study 2 compared reported type (MBTI results) on the four preferences to best-fit type, using two large datasets. All four IAT preference measures showed solid evidence of internal consistency (split-half correlations and Cronbach’s alphas). Compared to IAT scores, MBTI results showed a shift towards E, N, T, and J, preferences previous research has suggested are more socially desirable than I, S, F, and P. Best fit relative to reported preferences showed more S-to-N shifts than N-to-S and more E-to-I than I-to-E changes. One dataset showed a shift from P to J, but the second did not. Females were significantly less likely than males to change from F to T when comparing IAT to MBTI results or MBTI to best-fit results. A reanalysis of an expanded dataset first reported in Bathurst (2000) suggested that the preference of the MBTI professional conducting type verification (determining best fit in consultation with clients following presentation of MBTI results) led to switches from the opposite user preference to the same as the administrator for individuals with E, N, and P MBTI results, and for females with F results.

Abstract = {Comments on the article "Corrections for criterion reliability in validity generalization: A false prophet in a land of suspended judgment" by J. M. LeBreton, K. T. Scherer, & L. R. James (see record [rid]2014-57725-002[/rid]). We concur with LeBreton, Scherer, and James (2014) that meta-analytic corrections using .52 for the interrater reliability (IRR) of performance ratings does appear to result in an overestimate of criterion-related validity. In fact, the situation may even be worse than the authors portray. All of their predictor estimates appear to be based on direct range restriction, while the current thinking is that most restriction is indirect (Le & Schmidt, 2006), and indirect estimates of values tend to be even higher. For instance, reanalyses of mental ability (Hunter, Schmidt, & Le, 2006) and structured interviews (Huffcutt, Culbertson, & Weyhrauch, 2014) using indirect corrections result in validity estimates around .70. Using these updated indirect values, LeBreton et al.’s multiple correlation analysis results in all 100% of the criterion variance being accounted for by the predictors. There is a fundamental premise at hand. Instead of simply taking an IRR value and inserting it into the equation to correct a mean validity coefficient, first treat that value as a primary association and consider what artifacts impact it . We note that this premise is not new but rather was suggested over 2 decades ago and reinforced periodically since then (e.g., Callender & Osburn, 1980; Guion, 1998; LeBreton, Burgess, Kaiser, Atchley, & James, 2003; Sackett, Laczo, & Arvey, 2002). This premise, however, has not been incorporated into mainstream validity meta-analyses, including our own work on interviews. The purpose of our response is to further contextualize the problem raised by LeBreton et al. by addressing the issue of overcorrection specifically in relation to the validity of structured employment interviews, a predictor with which we are highly familiar. Using a combination of actual, simulated, and estimated parameters, we derive revised estimates of their mean corrected validity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, other credible research has clearly shown that self-assessments are poor predictors of individual achievement such that the validity of self-assessments has been called into question. Based on the reanalysis of two previously published studies and an analysis of two original studies, we show that grouped self-assessments may be good predictors of and hence valid measures of performance at the group level, an outcome commonly used in program evaluation studies. We found statistically significant correlation coefficients (between 0.56 and 0.87), when comparing across performance items using the group means of self-assessments with the group means of individual achievement on criterion tests. We call for further research into the conditions and circumstances in which grouped self-assessments are used, so that they can be employed more effectively and confidently by program evaluators, decision makers, and researchers.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to adapt the Attitudes Toward Acute Mental Health Scale (ATAMHS) into the Korean language and culture and then to determine the reliability and validity of it by administering it to a sample of Korean nursing students and nurses. We conducted a psychometric evaluation that included a two‐step item analysis (analysis and reanalysis), exploratory factor analysis and concurrent validity. The ATAMHS was translated into Korean by bilingual nurses. Then, 429 participants (224 undergraduate nursing students and 205 nurses, all with psychiatric experience) completed the translated version of the ATAMHS. The item analysis revealed that nine items correlated poorly with the rest; thus, they were deleted from the scale. The final Korean version of the scale, which we refer to as the Korean version of the ATAMHS (ATAMHS‐K), contains 24 items. The ATAMHS‐K showed good internal consistency. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors (professional perspective, semantic differentials and positive attitudes) that explained 39.5% of the variance. The ATAMHS‐K had strong correlations with the Korean version of the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill Scale, thus confirming the concurrent validity. Therefore, the ATAMHS‐K demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties as a measure of attitudes toward acute mental health in Korean nursing students and nurses.

Abstract = {Previous research on emotion in language has mainly concerned the impact of emotional information on several aspects of lexico-semantic analyses of single words. However, affective influences on morphosyntactic processing are less understood. In the present study, we focused on the impact of negative valence in the processing of gender agreement relations. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read three-word phrases and performed a syntactic judgment task. Negative and neutral adjectives could agree or disagree in gender with the preceding noun. At an electrophysiological level, the amplitude of a left anterior negativity (LAN) to gender agreement mismatches decreased in negative words, relative to neutral words. The behavioral data suggested that LAN amplitudes might be indexing the processing costs associated with the detection of gender agreement errors, since the detection of gender mismatches resulted in faster and more accurate responses than did the detection of correct gender agreement relations. According to this view, it seems that negative content facilitated the processes implicated in the early detection of gender agreement mismatches. However, gender agreement violations in negative words triggered processes involved in the reanalysis and repair of the syntactic structure, as reflected in larger P600 amplitudes to incorrect than to correct phrases, irrespective of their emotional valence.

This study overcomes some of the shortcomings in the current methodology by applying classification and regression trees (CART) to meta-analytic data in a special way, referred to as Meta-CART. The aim was to identify particular combinations of BCTs that explain intervention success. Method: A reanalysis of data from Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, and Gupta (2009) was performed. These data included effect sizes from 122 interventions targeted at physical activity and healthy eating, and the coding of the interventions into 26 BCTs. A CART analysis was performed using the BCTs as predictors and treatment success (i.e., effect size) as outcome. A subgroup meta-analysis using a mixed effects model was performed to compare the treatment effect in the subgroups found by CART. Results: Meta-CART identified the following most effective combinations: Provide information about behavior–health link with Prompt intention formation (mean effect size ḡ = 0.46), and Provide information about behavior–health link with Provide information on consequences and Use of follow-up prompts (ḡ = 0.44). Least effective interventions were those using Provide feedback on performance without using Provide instruction (ḡ = 0.05). Conclusions: Specific combinations of BCTs increase the likelihood of achieving change in health behavior, whereas other combinations decrease this likelihood. Meta-CART successfully identified these combinations and thus provides a viable methodology in the context of meta-analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Language comprehension is assumed to proceed incrementally, and comprehenders commit to initial interpretations even in the absence of unambiguous information. Initial ambiguous object arguments are therefore preferably interpreted as subjects, an interpretation that needs to be revised towards an object initial interpretation once the disambiguating information is encountered. Most accounts of such grammatical function reanalyses assume that they involve phrase structure revisions, and do not differ from other syntactic reanalyses. A number of studies using measurements of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) provide evidence for this view by showing that both reanalysis types engender similar neurophysiological responses (e.g., P600 effects). Others have claimed that grammatical function reanalyses rather involve revisions of the mapping of thematic roles to argument noun phrases (NPs). In line with this, it has been shown that grammatical function reanalysis during spoken language comprehension engenders a N400 effect, an effect which has been shown to correlate with general problems in the mapping of thematic roles to argument NPs in a number of languages. This study investigated the ERP correlate to grammatical function reanalysis in Swedish. Postverbal NPs that disambiguated the interpretation of object-topicalised sentences towards an object-initial reading engendered a N400 effect with a local, right-parietal distribution. This "reanalysis N400" effect provides further support for the view that grammatical function reanalysis is functionally distinct from syntactic reanalyses and rather involves a revision of the mapping of thematic roles to the sentence arguments. Postverbal subject pronouns in object-topicalised sentences were also found to engender an enhanced P300 wave in comparison to object pronouns, an effect which seems to depend on the overall infrequency of object-topicalised constructions. This finding provides support for the view that the ‘‘reanalysis N400’’ in some cases can be attenuated by a task-related P300 component. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 33(8) of Clinical Psychology Review (see record [rid]2013-42151-026[/rid]). In the original article, the authors found that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the treatments were equally effective. The corrections are present in the erratum.] Despite the evidence suggesting that all treatments intended to be therapeutic are equally efficacious, the conjecture that one form of treatment, namely cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is superior to all other treatment persists. The purpose of the current study was to (a) reanalyze the clinical trials from an earlier meta-analysis that compared CBT to ‘other therapies’ for depression and anxiety (viz., Tolin, 2010) and (b) conduct a methodologically rigorous and comprehensive meta-analysis to determine the relative efficacy of CBT and bona fide non-CBT treatments for adult anxiety disorders. Although the reanalysis was consistent with the earlier meta-analysis' findings of small to medium effect sizes for disorder-specific symptom measures, the reanalysis revealed no evidence for the superiority of CBT for depression and anxiety for outcomes that were not disorder-specific. Following the reanalysis, a comprehensive anxiety meta-analysis that utilized a survey of 91 CBT experts from the Association of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapists (ABCT) to consensually identify CBT treatments was conducted. Thirteen clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. There were no differences between CBT treatments and bona fide non-CBT treatments across disorder-specific and non-disorder specific symptom measures. These analyses, in combination with previous meta-analytic findings, fail to provide corroborative evidence for the conjecture that CBT is superior to bona fide non-CBT treatments.

Abstract = {Background: Learned helplessness has excellent validity as an animal model for depression, but problems in reproducibility limit its use and the high degree of stress involved in the paradigm raises ethical concerns. We therefore aimed to identify which and how many trials of the learned helplessness paradigm are necessary to distinguish between helpless and non-helpless rats. Findings: A trial-by-trial reanalysis of tests from 163 rats with congenital learned helplessness or congenital non-learned helplessness and comparison of 82 rats exposed to inescapable shock with 38 shock-controls revealed that neither the first test trials, when rats showed unspecific hyperlocomotion, nor trials of the last third of the test, when almost all animals responded quickly to the stressor, contributed to sensitivity and specificity of the test. Considering only trials 3–10 improved the classification of helpless and non-helpless rats. Conclusions: The refined analysis allows abbreviation of the test for learned helplessness from 15 trials to 10 trials thereby reducing pain and stress of the experimental animals without losing statistical power.

Abstract = {Most studies of the neural correlates of humor processing have used functional magnetic resonance imaging, but few studies have examined the temporal dynamics of humor processing. The current study examined the temporal dynamics of cortical activation that underlies incongruity detection, resolution and elaboration of humor. Event-related potentials were measured while 31 participants read jokes, non-jokes and nonsensical sentences. The results showed that nonsensical sentences elicited the most negative ERP deflection (N400) between 350 and 500 ms, which possibly reflects incongruity detection in humor. Jokes and non-jokes elicited a more positive deflection (P600) than nonsensical sentences between 500 and 700 ms, which possibly reflects a reanalysis process during incongruity resolution. Moreover, jokes elicited the most positive slow-wave activity between 800 and 1500 ms, which may be related to emotional processing during elaboration. These results support that N400, P600 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) index the cognitive functions involved in humor processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Profile similarity metrics provide an ideal framework to score rating-based judgment tests. These tests are distinct in asking subjects to rate the relative adequacy of multiple responses for each question. Respondent scores should be based on how well an individual’s rating profile matches the answer key. However, respondents whose "rating-elevation" (tendency to give systematically low or high ratings) or "rating-scatter" (tendency to use more or less of the available scale) differs from the elevation and scatter of the scoring key can be given inappropriately low scores by distance-based algorithms. This can occur despite very high response accuracy with respect to the goal of correctly rating the relative adequacy of the response options for each question, “rating shape.” Using this framework, reanalyses of MSCEIT data showed that after correcting scores for elevation and scatter effects, the MSCEIT is best described by a single factor that is highly g-loaded, (r = .79), not multiple factors with low g-loadings as hypothesized by its measurement model. These results demonstrate the importance of using profile similarity metrics (i.e., shape, elevation, and scatter) to evaluate the construct-related validity for rating-based judgment tests.

Abstract = {Correlations in neuronal spike times are thought to be key to processing in many neural systems. Many measures have been proposed to summarize these correlations and of these the correlation index is widely used and is the standard in studies of spontaneous retinal activity. We show that this measure has two undesirable properties: it is unbounded above and confounded by firing rate. We list properties needed for a measure to fairly quantify and compare correlations and we propose a novel measure of correlation—the spike time tiling coefficient. This coefficient, the correlation index, and 33 other measures of correlation of spike times are blindly tested for the required properties on synthetic and experimental data. Based on this, we propose a measure (the spike time tiling coefficient) to replace the correlation index. To demonstrate the benefits of this measure, we reanalyze data from seven key studies, which previously used the correlation index to investigate the nature of spontaneous activity. We reanalyze data from β2(KO) and β2(TG) mutants, mutants lacking connexin isoforms, and also the age-dependent changes in wild-type and β2(KO) correlations. Reanalysis of the data using the proposed measure can significantly change the conclusions. It leads to better quantification of correlations and therefore better inference from the data. We hope that the proposed measure will have wide applications, and will help clarify the role of activity in retinotopic map formation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

This article considers how work in the tradition of grammaticalization has informed such approaches and points out some of the differences between the two research traditions. It highlights some of the problems around adopting key features of the grammaticalization tradition into a model of language structure which sees the language system as a network of conventionalized pairings of form and meaning, in which specific micro-constructions inherit properties from more general schemas. It also considers key issues in language change, such as directionality, the relationship between reanalysis and analogy, and the status of clines and parameters.

Abstract = {The current study provides evidence that the absence of a syntactically expected item leads to a sustained cognitive processing demand. Event-related potentials were measured at the omission of a syntactically expected object argument in a speech sequence. English monolingual adults listened to paired sentences. The first sentence in the pair established a context. The second sentence provided a response to the first sentence that was either grammatically correct by containing an overt object argument in the form of a pronoun, or was syntactically unacceptable by omitting the expected object pronoun. Event-related potentials measured at the omission of the object argument showed a prolonged positivity for 100–600ms with a broad scalp distribution, and for 600–1000 ms with a focus in the anterior region. This observed omitted stimulus potential may contain characteristics of the P300 component, associated with the detection of the deviation of an expected stimulus, and the classical P600 related to syntactic reanalysis. Further, the late anterior P600 may indicate an increased memory demand in sentence comprehension. Thus, this linguistic omitted stimulus potential is a cognitive indicator of language processing that can be used to investigate the organization of linguistic knowledge.

Abstract = {This paper examines people's reasoning about identity continuity (i.e., how people decide that a particular object is the same object over time) and its relation to previous research on how people value one‐of‐a‐kind artifacts, such as artwork. We propose that judgments about the continuity of artworks are related to judgments about the continuity of individual persons because art objects are seen as physical extensions of their creators. We report a reanalysis of previous data and the results of two new empirical studies that test this hypothesis. The first study demonstrates that the mere categorization of an object as “art” versus “a tool” changes people's intuitions about the persistence of those objects over time. In a second study, we examine some conditions that may lead artworks to be thought of as different from other artifacts. These observations inform both current understanding of what makes some objects one‐of‐a‐kind as well as broader questions regarding how people intuitively think about the persistence of human agents.

Abstract = {This study reexamines the issue of how much of working memory storage is central, or shared across sensory modalities and verbal and nonverbal codes, and how much is peripheral, or specific to a modality or code. In addition to the exploration of many parameters in 9 new dual-task experiments and reanalysis of some prior evidence, the innovations of the present work compared to previous studies of memory for 2 stimulus sets include (a) use of a principled set of formulas to estimate the number of items in working memory and (b) a model to dissociate central components, which are allocated to very different stimulus sets depending on the instructions, from peripheral components, which are used for only 1 kind of material. We consistently find that the central contribution is smaller than was suggested by Saults and Cowan (2007) and that the peripheral contribution is often much larger when the task does not require the binding of features within an object. Previous capacity estimates are consistent with the sum of central plus peripheral components observed here. We consider the implications of the data as constraints on theories of working memory storage and maintenance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

(2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(33):13684–13689] claimed to have observed significant differences in gene expression related to hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions of well-being. Having closely examined both their claims and their data, we draw substantially different conclusions. After identifying some important conceptual and methodological flaws in their argument, we report the results of a series of reanalyses of their dataset. We first applied a variety of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques to their self-reported well-being data. A number of plausible factor solutions emerged, but none of these corresponded to Fredrickson et al.’s claimed hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions. We next examined the regression analyses that purportedly yielded distinct differential profiles of gene expression associated with the two well-being dimensions. Using the best-fitting two-factor solution that we identified, we obtained effects almost twice as large as those found by Fredrickson et al. using their questionable hedonic and eudaimonic factors. Next, we conducted regression analyses for all possible two-factor solutions of the psychometric data; we found that 69.2% of these gave statistically significant results for both factors, whereas only 0.25% would be expected to do so if the regression process was really able to identify independent differential gene expression effects. Finally, we replaced Fredrickson et al.’s psychometric data with random numbers and continued to find very large numbers of apparently statistically significant effects. We conclude that Fredrickson et al.’s widely publicized claims about the effects of different dimensions of well-being on health-related gene expression are merely artifacts of dubious analyses and erroneous methodology.

Abstract = {Objective: Visuospatial working memory impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, most ADHD research has focused on the neural correlates of nonspatial mnemonic processes. This study examined brain activation and functional connectivity for visuospatial working memory in youth with and without ADHD. Method: Twenty-four youth with ADHD and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an N-back test of working memory for spatial position. Block-design analyses contrasted activation and functional connectivity separately for high (2-back) and low (1-back) working memory load conditions versus the control condition (0-back). The effect of working memory load was modeled with linear contrasts. Results: The 2 groups performed comparably on the task and demonstrated similar patterns of frontoparietal activation, with no differences in linear gains in activation as working memory load increased. However, youth with ADHD showed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), greater functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and left intraparietal sulcus, and reduced left DLPFC connectivity with left midcingulate cortex and PCC for the high load contrast compared to controls (p < .01; k > 100 voxels). Reanalysis using a more conservative statistical approach (p < .001; k > 100 voxels) yielded group differences in PCC activation and DLPFC-midcingulate connectivity. Conclusion: Youth with ADHD show decreased efficiency of DLPFC for high-load visuospatial working memory and greater reliance on posterior spatial attention circuits to store and update spatial position than healthy control youth. Findings should be replicated in larger samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Woodley (see record [rid]2013-18251-008[/rid]). Previously Woodley, te Nijenhuis and Murphy (2013) tested the hypothesis that Victorian era British and American samples exhibited higher g on average than relatively more modern populations sampled from the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Finland, using measures of simple visual reaction time in a meta-analytic study. Based on 13 age-matched studies from Western countries conducted between 1884 and 2004 yielding 16 data points we estimated a decline of−13.35 IQ points. Here we respond to a quartet of critical commentaries on our paper penned by five prominent intelligence researchers (James Flynn, Theodore Nettelbeck, Irwin Silverman, Julia Dodonova and Yuri Dodonov). We show via various reanalyses of the data and also via careful consideration of the arguments presented that the original finding of a potential secular decline in simple reaction time performance is robust. A recurrent criticism of our finding stems from earlier work showing no secular trends with respect to inspection time over a 20-year period in Australia despite the possibility of co-occurring dysgenic fertility. We deal with this via the method of correlated vectors, which reveals the presence of a ‘genetic g’ common factor on which simple RTs, WAIS g loadings and subtest heritabilities load positively and significantly, but on which inspection time does not load. This indicates that inspection times are associated with local information processing, unlike simple reaction times, which are associated with global processing (i.e. g). The robustness of our original finding is best illustrated however by our final meta-regression, in which the use of six methods variance-controlled reaction time means taken from the US and the UK between 1889 and 1993, coupled with a newly-estimated age-matched reference standard deviation, reveal a seemingly robust secular trend towards slowing reaction time in these two countries, which translates into a potential dysgenics rate of−1.21 IQ points per decade, or−13.9 points in total between 1889 and 2004. We conclude by arguing that the best way forward is to test novel predictions stemming from our finding relating to molecular genetics, neurophysiology and alternative cognitive indicators, thus shifting the research focus away from the purely methodological level towards the broader nomological level. We thank our critics for helping us to arrive at a much more precise estimate of the decline in general intelligence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Despite the similar transparency of their orthographies, reading in Italian has been found to be affected by frequency but not age of acquisition (AoA) [Barca, L., Burani, C., & Arduino, L. S. (2002). Word naming times and psycholinguistic norms for Italian nouns. Behaviour Research Methods, Instruments and Computers, 34, 424–434] while reading in Spanish is affected by AoA but not frequency [Cuetos, F., & Barbón, A. (2006). Word naming in Spanish. European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 18, 415–436]. We examined this cross-linguistic difference, firstly, through a reanalysis of the Italian and Spanish reading latencies. After eliminating several between-experiment differences, we replicated the AoA effect in Spanish but not in Italian and the frequency effect in Italian but not in Spanish. The cross-linguistic comparison could not equate stimulus imageability; therefore, secondly, we compared the Italian reading latencies with new Spanish reading latencies for imageability-matched words. We found frequency effects but neither an AoA effect nor a language by AoA interaction. We argue that the previously reported cross-linguistic difference in the AoA effect resulted from a between-study difference in stimulus imageability. More imageable words induced more semantic involvement in reading, yielding an AoA effect in Spanish. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Introduction: Recent research on the association between delusions and violence has suggested complex and differing pathways. Furthermore, it has been emphasized that temporal proximity is fundamental when investigating these relationships. We reanalyzed data from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study utilizing a different methodological approach to investigate associations between specific delusions and violence. Methods: Longitudinal study of 1136 male and female civil psychiatric inpatients after discharge. Delusions, affect due to delusions, and violence were measured at baseline and in 5 follow-up assessments. Serious violence was established using the MacArthur Community Violence Interview. Logistic mixed-effect models for repeated measures were performed. Results: A “prospective” model confirmed previous findings that delusions do not predict later violence. However, reanalysis, considering temporal proximity, indicated a relationship between specific delusions and outcome including: being spied upon (adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.06–2.47, P = .027), being followed (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.29–2.80, P = .001), being plotted against (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.14–2.52, P = .009), being under control of person/force (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.24–2.97, P = .003), thought insertion (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.00–2.66, P = .048), and having special gifts/powers (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.31–2.92, P = .001). All these delusions were associated with angry affect (P < .05). Inclusion of anger in the model significantly attenuated the main effects (except grandiose delusions), indicating an indirect pathway. Conclusions: Temporal proximity is crucial when investigating relationships between delusions and violence. Anger due to delusions is the key factor in this pathway. Our findings have important implications for identification of psychotic patients at risk for violent behavior and, most importantly, management of their risk.

Abstract = {Concerning the dispositional determinants of prosocial behavior and cooperation, work based on the classic 5 personality factors, and especially Agreeableness, has turned out somewhat inconsistent. A clearer picture has emerged from consideration of the HEXACO model of personality—though supported entirely by hypothetical behavior as criterion, so far. Thus, in 2 studies and a reanalysis, we investigated “actual behavior” in the form of individually and socially consequential distribution decisions. As expected, HEXACO Honesty-Humility consistently predicted prosocial behavior, including a theory-consistent pattern on the facet level. Importantly, this pattern might explain why five-factor Agreeableness has only sometimes been found to account for prosocial behavior. Indeed, further results indicate that five-factor Agreeableness comprises some aspects that are predictive of prosocial behavior—aspects well covered by HEXACO Honesty-Humility—but also others that play no role for this criterion. As such, the links between five-factor Agreeableness and prosocial behavior are well-covered by HEXACO Honesty-Humility, but not vice versa. Taken together, these findings hint that especially HEXACO Honesty-Humility (and certain aspects of five-factor Agreeableness) account for prosocial behavior—thus explaining previous inconsistencies and providing a more nuanced understanding of the links between basic personality and prosocial or cooperative behavior.

Abstract = {Experientialist semantics has contributed to a broader notion of linguistic meaning by emphasizing notions such as construal, perspective, metaphor, and embodiment, but has suffered from an individualist concept of meaning and has conflated experiential motivations with conventional semantics. We argue that these problems can be redressed by methods and concepts from phenomenology, on the basis of a case study of sentences of non-actual motion such as “The mountain range goes all the way from Mexico to Canada.” Through a phenomenological reanalysis of proposals of Talmy, Langacker, and Matlock, we show that non-actual motion is both experientially and linguistically non-unitary. At least three different features of human consciousness—enactive perception, visual scanning, and imagination—constitute experiential motivations for non-actual motion sentences, and each of these could be related to phenomenological analyses of human intentionality. The second problem is addressed by proposing that the experiential motivations of non-actual motion sentences can be viewed as sedimented through “passive” processes of acquisition and social transmission and that this implies an interactive loop between experience and language, yielding losses in terms of original experience, but gains in terms of communal signification. Something that is underestimated by phenomenology is that what is sedimented are not only intentional objects such as states of affairs, but aspects of how they are given, i.e., the original, temporal, bodily experiences themselves. Since cognitive semantics has emphasized such aspects of meaning, we suggest that phenomenology can itself benefit from experientialist semantics, especially when it turns its focus from prepredicative to predicative, linguistic intentionality.

Abstract = {Objectives: To assess how often stratified randomisation is used, whether analysis adjusted for all balancing variables, and whether the method of randomisation was adequately reported, and to reanalyse a previously reported trial to assess the impact of ignoring balancing factors in the analysis. Design: Review of published trials and reanalysis of a previously reported trial. Setting: Four leading general medical journals (BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine) and the second Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial (MIST2). Participants: 258 trials published in 2010 in the four journals. Cluster randomised, crossover, non-randomised, single arm, and phase I or II trials were excluded, as were trials reporting secondary analyses, interim analyses, or results that had been previously published in 2010. Main outcome measures: Whether the method of randomisation was adequately reported, how often balanced randomisation was used, and whether balancing factors were adjusted for in the analysis. Results: Reanalysis of MIST2 showed that an unadjusted analysis led to larger P values and a loss of power. The review of published trials showed that balanced randomisation was common, with 163 trials (63%) using at least one balancing variable. The most common methods of balancing were stratified permuted blocks (n = 85) and minimisation (n = 27). The method of randomisation was unclear in 37% of trials. Most trials that balanced on centre or prognostic factors were not adequately analysed; only 26% of trials adjusted for all balancing factors in their primary analysis. Trials that did not adjust for balancing factors in their analysis were less likely to show a statistically significant result (unadjusted 57% v adjusted 78%, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Balancing on centre or prognostic factors is common in trials but often poorly described, and the implications of balancing are poorly understood. Trialists should adjust their primary analysis for balancing factors to obtain correct P values and confidence intervals and to avoid an unnecessary loss in power.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Reminder and 2AFC tasks provide similar estimates of the difference limen: A reanalysis of data from Lapid, Ulrich, and Rammsayer (2008) and a discussion of Ulrich and Vorberg (2009)" by Miguel A. García-Pérez and Rocío Alcalá-Quintana (Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 2010[May], Vol 72[4], 1155-1178). The original article contains an error that has some theoretical importance. The error lies in that asymptote parameters reflecting lapses or finger errors should not enter the constraint relating the psychometric functions that describe performance when the comparison stimulus in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) discrimination task is presented in the first or second interval. The error is also demonstrated in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-08953-033[/rid]). Lapid, Ulrich, and Rammsayer (see record [rid]2008-04948-010[/rid]) reported that estimates of the difference limen (DL) from a two- alternative forced choice (2AFC) task are higher than those obtained from a reminder task. This article reanalyzes their data in order to correct an error in their estimates of the DL from 2AFC data. We also extend the psychometric functions fitted to data from both tasks to incorporate an extra parameter that has been shown to allow obtaining accurate estimates of the DL that are unaffected by lapses. Contrary to Lapid et al.’s conclusion, our reanalysis shows that DLs estimated with the 2AFC task are only minimally (and not always significantly) larger than those estimated with the reminder task. We also show that their data are contaminated by response bias, and that the small remaining difference between DLs estimated with 2AFC and reminder tasks can be reasonably attributed to the differential effects that response bias has in either task as they were defined in Lapid et al.’s experiments. Finally, we discuss a novel approach presented by Ulrich and Vorberg (2009) for fitting psychometric functions to 2AFC discrimination data.

To evaluate the utility of this strategy and compare our data with the findings of Wang et al., the replyers have reanalyzed our data in line with the five-factor model. The repliers refrained from conducting a multiple regression analysis, as done by Wang et al., because of issues of multicollinearity between PTSD symptom factors, which may compromise the validity of estimates. In this reply repliers find a negative relationship between hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and avoidance symptoms is in line with the data reported by Wang et al. Conversely, these authors did not observe a relationship between HCC and emotional numbing and, surprisingly, reported a non significant trend for a positive relationship with intrusion symptoms. It is conceivable that their trend for a positive association with intrusion symptoms may be a statistical artifact induced by multicollinearity of predictor variables. PTSD symptom factors being entered simultaneously but could also be an influence on their model 1 results owing to the simultaneous inclusion of PTSD symptoms and depressiveness. The findings of this current reanalysis of data are not suggestive of this assertion, even though we can confirm that avoidance symptoms, as defined by the five-factor “dysphoric arousal” model, were negatively associated with HCC. Finally, future research should also aim to evaluate the utility of the recently proposed four-factor model of DSM-V in this context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Unfortunately, Robert Gibbons, PhD, declined the opportunity to adjudicate between our findings and concludes that "there is no way to comment on the accuracy" of the 2 sets of results, despite his and our inability to replicate the higher risk observed by Kaplan et al. Clearly, had Gibbons requested the data sets and analytic code from both published studies, it would have been possible to ascertain whether differences in the analytic datasets, analytic strategy, or simple human error explained these differences. Because Gibbons chose not to undertake this effort, the most transparent way to resolve the issue is for the NHIS to conduct a reanalysis and report the findings. We have done so and urge Kaplan to do the same. Instead of offering the specific findings of his own reanalysis of the current the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index (NHIS-NDI) data set, Gibbons uses his editorial to explore rates of suicide among men identified by the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) as current or former members of the US military. We feel obliged to respond to this new analysis, both because our long involvement with the development of NVDRS leads us to question whether the NVDRS can currently identify veterans with accuracy and because Gibbons conflates 3 important but distinct issues in his analysis: suicide risk among veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), risk among younger veterans (irrespective of conflict), and risk among those recently separated from active military duty. To his credit, Gibbons tries to subtract out known active duty suicides from suicides identified as ever having served. However, as exemplified by the ways in which he distributes active duty suicides across NVDRS versus non-NVDRS states (and across age strata), Gibbons makes assumptions that further bias his estimates.

Van Petten and Luka’s (2012, International Journal of Psychophysiology, 83(2), 176–190) literature survey of late positive ERP components elicited by more or less predictable words during sentence processing led them to propose two topographically and functionally distinct positivities: a parietal one associated with semantically incongruent words related to semantic reanalysis and a frontal one with unknown significance associated with congruent but lexically unpredicted words. With the goal of testing this hypothesis within a single set of experimental materials and participants, we report results from two ERP studies: Experiment 1, a post-hoc analysis of a dataset that varied on dimensions of both cloze probability (predictability) and plausibility, and Experiment 2, a follow-up study in which these factors were manipulated in a controlled fashion. In both studies, we observed distinct post-N400 positivities: a more anterior one to plausible, but not anomalous, low cloze probability sentence medial words, and a more posterior one to semantically anomalous sentence continuations. Taken together with an observed canonical cloze-modulated N400, these dual positivities indicate a dissociation between brain processes relating to written words' sentential predictability versus plausibility, clearly an important distinction for any viable neural or psycholinguistic model of written sentence processing.

Abstract = {Objective: The Incredible Years Series intervention has demonstrated efficacy for decreasing conduct disorder (CD) symptomatology in clinically affected youth in multiple randomized controlled trials. Because children with family psychiatric histories of antisocial behavior are at markedly increased risk for enduring symptoms of antisocial behavior (compared with their counterparts with a negative family history), the authors examined whether intervention effects across studies would prevail in that subgroup or would be relatively restricted to children without genetic risk. Method: A reanalysis was conducted of 5 randomized controlled trials of Incredible Years involving 280 clinically affected children 3 to 8 years of age for whom a family psychiatric history of externalizing behavior in first- and second-degree relatives was ascertained from at least 1 parent. Results: Incredible Years equally benefitted children with CD with and without family psychiatric histories of externalizing behavior. Family psychiatric history of externalizing behavior and parental depressive symptomatology predicted greater severity of CD symptomatology at baseline. Conclusion: The beneficial effects of IY are evident in children with CD, irrespective of whether their conditions are more or less attributable to inherited susceptibility to enduring antisocial syndromes. A next phase of research should address whether earlier implementation of group-based education for parents of young children at increased familial risk for antisocial behavior syndromes—before the development of disruptive patterns of behavior—would result in even more pronounced effects and thereby constitute a cost-effective, targeted, preventive intervention for CD.

Abstract = {Background: Most evidence in the UK on the effectiveness of brief therapy for depression concerns cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). In a trial published in 2000, we showed that non-directive counselling and CBT were equally effective in general practice for patients with depression and mixed anxiety and depression. Our results were criticized for including patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. In this reanalysis we aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two therapies for patients with an ICD-10 depressive episode. Method: Patients with an ICD-10 depressive episode or mixed anxiety and depression were randomized to counselling, CBT or usual general practitioner (GP) care. Counsellors provided nondirective, interpersonal counselling following a manual that we developed based on the work of Carl Rogers. Cognitive behaviour therapists provided CBT also guided by a manual. Modelling was carried out using generalized estimating equations with the multiply imputed datasets. Outcomes were mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, and Social Adjustment Scale at 4 and 12 months. Results: A total of 134 participants were randomized to CBT, 126 to counselling and 67 to usual GP care. We undertook (1) an interaction analysis using all 316 patients who were assigned a diagnosis and (2) a head-to-head comparison using only those 130 (41%) participants who had an ICD-10 depressive episode at baseline. CBT and counselling were both superior to GP care at 4 months but not at 12 months. There was no difference in the effectiveness of the two psychological therapies. Conclusions: We recommend that national clinical guidelines take our findings into consideration in recommending effective alternatives to CBT.

Abstract = {The primary objective of this article was to critically evaluate the routine use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for representing an individual’s performance across a battery of executive function tasks. A conceptual review and statistical reanalysis of N = 10 studies that used CFA methods of EF tasks was undertaken. Despite evidence of excellent global model fit for CFA models, studies were uniformly characterized by weak correlations among EF tasks and weak to moderate levels of maximal reliability of latent EF constructs. Vanishing tetrad tests raised the possibility that individual tasks may be better conceptualized as causal rather than as effect indicators of the latent construct of EF. The use of CFA methods with EF tasks that are weakly correlated results in latent variables that have poor to modest maximal reliability. This undermines efforts to use latent variables of EF as predictors or outcomes in empirical studies and has implications for theory development. Greater attention to and resolution of the discrepancies between conceptual definitions and statistical approaches that are used to model EF has implications for the long-term value of using EF in research and clinical settings.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Edward W. Gondolf (see record [rid]2012-29398-005[/rid]).This article presents a reanalysis of data from Gondolf’s (2012) article in this journal on reoffending by men in the 15-month period subsequent to participation in batterer intervention programs. Gondolf concludes that violence by the female partners “was relatively low and does not appear to influence the program outcome in terms of men’s reassault” (p. 10). The reanalyzed data lead to the opposite conclusion. The policy and practice implications are that the high rate of assault by women, including initiation of violence by female partners, needs to be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of programs to prevent and stop violence against women.

Abstract = {[Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 111(37) of PNAS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (see record [rid]2014-39531-009[/rid]). The authors feel that, in the original article, the presented findings are not currently sufficiently robust to provide definitive support for the conclusions of the paper, and that an extensive reanalysis of the data is required. The authors have therefore unanimously decided to retract this paper at this time.] Functional interactions between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during working memory have been studied extensively as an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. Coupling abnormalities have been found in patients, their unaffected siblings, and carriers of common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, but the global genetic architecture of this imaging phenotype is unclear. To achieve genome-wide hypothesisfree identification of genes and pathways associated with prefrontal– hippocampal interactions, we combined gene set enrichment analysis with whole-genome genotyping and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 269 healthy German volunteers. We found significant enrichment of the synapse organization and biogenesis gene set. This gene set included known schizophrenia risk genes, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, beta 2 subunit (CACNB2), as well as genes with well-defined roles in neurodevelopmental and plasticity processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and have mechanistic links to prefrontal–hippocampal functional interactions. Our results demonstrate a readily generalizable approach that can be used to identify the neurogenetic basis of systems-level phenotypes. Moreover, our findings identify gene sets in which genetic variation may contribute to disease risk through altered prefrontal– hippocampal functional interactions and suggest a link to both ongoing and developmental synaptic plasticity.

Abstract = {Background: Previous research has suggested that vitamin D and sunlight are related to cardiovascular outcomes, but associations between sunlight and risk factors have not been investigated. We examined whether increased sunlight exposure was related to improved cardiovascular risk factor status. Methods: Residential histories merged with satellite, ground monitor, and model reanalysis data were used to determine previous-year sunlight radiation exposure for 17,773 black and white participants aged 45+ from the US. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses were performed by randomly dividing the sample into halves. Logistic regression models were used to examine relationships with cardiovascular risk factors. Results: The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein levels in adjusted exploratory (−2.7 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: −4.2, −1.2]) and confirmatory (−1.5 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: −3.0, −0.1]) models. The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in unadjusted exploratory and confirmatory, as well as the adjusted exploratory model (2.3 mmHg [95% confidence interval: 0.8, 3.8]), but not the adjusted confirmatory model (1.6 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: −0.5, 3.7]). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that lower long-term sunlight exposure has an association with lower high-density lipoprotein levels. However, all associations were weak, thus it is not known if insolation may affect cardiovascular outcomes through these risk factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Group work is used as a means for learning at all levels in educational systems. There is strong scientific support for the benefits of having students learning and working in groups. Nevertheless, studies about what occurs in groups during group work and which factors actually influence the students’ ability to learn is still lacking. Similarly, the question of why some group work is successful and other group work results in the opposite is still unsolved. The aim of this article is to add to the current level of knowledge and understandings regarding the essence behind successful group work in higher education. This research is focused on the students’ experiences of group work and learning in groups, which is an almost non-existing aspect of research on group work prior to the beginning of the 21st century. A primary aim is to give university students a voice in the matter by elucidating the students’ positive and negative points of view and how the students assess learning when working in groups. Furthermore, the students’ explanations of why some group work ends up being a positive experience resulting in successful learning, while in other cases, the result is the reverse, are of interest. Data were collected through a study-specific questionnaire, with multiple choice and open-ended questions. The questionnaires were distributed to students in different study programs at two universities in Sweden. The present result is based on a reanalysis and qualitative analysis formed a key part of the study. The results indicate that most of the students’ experiences involved group work that facilitated learning, especially in the area of academic knowledge. Three important prerequisites (learning, study-social function, and organization) for group work that served as an effective pedagogy and as an incentive for learning were identified and discussed. All three abstractions facilitate or hamper students’ learning, as well as impact their experiences with group work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore subgroup effects by high and low socioeconomic position (SEP) of three previously conducted, effective European interventions. Methods: Reanalyses stratified by SEP were conducted by the research groups of each study. All studies were school-based: two multi-component interventions targeting intake of fat or fruit and vegetables (FV), and a free breakfast initiative. Results: Computer-tailored advice affected fat intake among low, but not high SEP girls after 1 year. A multi-component intervention affected the total FV intake in both SEP groups, vegetable intake in low SEP and fruit intake in high SEP across three countries after 1 year, whereas free fruit affected total FV and fruit intake equally in both SEP groups in one country after 2 years. Providing a free healthy breakfast increased consumption of healthy food items only in the low SEP group. Conclusions Reanalysing intervention studies by SEP is a quick and easy way to explore patterns in effects by SEP across interventions. Providing healthy food might be a promising strategy for decreasing social inequalities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) are common in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We examined whether small juxtacortical hemorrhages (JCHs) are characteristic for CVT and studied their radiological and pathological properties. Methods: We identified all patients with CVT and an ICH at baseline admitted between 2000 and 2011 (prospectively from July 2006). JCH was defined as a hemorrhage (diameter < 20mm) located in the white matter just below the cortex. To determine the specificity of JCHs for CVT, we examined the frequency of JCHs in a control group of patients of similar age with an ICH not related to CVT. Results: Of 114 patients with CVT, 53 had an ICH. JCHs were present in 14 of the 53 (26%). The remaining 39 had other kinds of hemorrhages. Papilledema was more common among patients with a JCH compared to patients with other types of ICHs (44% vs 9%, p = 0.01). All patients with a JCH except 1 had thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, compared to 49% of patients with CVT and other kinds of hemorrhages (p = 0.004). Reanalysis of all imaging data and histopathologic analysis in 1 patient showed that JCHs are located near the U‐fibers and that they follow the curvature of the cortex. Among 196 control patients (spontaneous ICH, not caused by CVT), only 3 patients had a JCH. One of these 3 appeared on re‐examination of all imaging results to have had CVT. Interpretation: Small nontraumatic JCHs are a characteristic feature of CVT and are rarely encountered in other conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Proportion correct in two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) detection tasks often varies when the stimulus is presented in the first or in the second interval. Reanalysis of published data reveals that these order effects (or interval bias) are strong and prevalent, refuting the standard difference model of signal detection theory. Order effects are commonly regarded as evidence that observers use an off-center criterion under the difference model with bias. We consider an alternative difference model with indecision whereby observers are occasionally undecided and guess with some bias toward one of the response options. Whether or not the data show order effects, the two models fit 2AFC data indistinguishably, but they yield meaningfully different estimates of sensory parameters. Under indeterminacy as to which model governs 2AFC performance, parameter estimates are suspect and potentially misleading. The indeterminacy can be circumvented by modifying the response format so that observers can express indecision when needed. Reanalysis of published data collected in this way lends support to the indecision model. We illustrate alternative approaches to fitting psychometric functions under the indecision model and discuss designs for 2AFC experiments that improve the accuracy of parameter estimates, whether or not order effects are apparent in the data.

Siddiqui, Abigail M. Lindemann, D. Martin Kivlighan III, Kevin M. Laska, Aaron C. Del Re, Takuya Minami and Bruce E. Wampold (Clinical Psychology Review, 2013[Apr], Vol 33[3], 395-405). In the original article, the authors found that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the treatments were equally effective. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-09199-007[/rid]). Despite the evidence suggesting that all treatments intended to be therapeutic are equally efficacious, the conjecture that one form of treatment, namely cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is superior to all other treatment persists. The purpose of the current study was to (a) reanalyze the clinical trials from an earlier meta-analysis that compared CBT to ‘other therapies’ for depression and anxiety (viz., Tolin, 2010) and (b) conduct a methodologically rigorous and comprehensive meta-analysis to determine the relative efficacy of CBT and bona fide non-CBT treatments for adult anxiety disorders. Although the reanalysis was consistent with the earlier meta-analysis' findings of small to medium effect sizes for disorder-specific symptom measures, the reanalysis revealed no evidence for the superiority of CBT for depression and anxiety for outcomes that were not disorder-specific. Following the reanalysis, a comprehensive anxiety meta-analysis that utilized a survey of 91 CBT experts from the Association of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapists (ABCT) to consensually identify CBT treatments was conducted. Thirteen clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. There were no differences between CBT treatments and bona fide non-CBT treatments across disorder-specific and non-disorder specific symptom measures. These analyses, in combination with previous meta-analytic findings, fail to provide corroborative evidence for the conjecture that CBT is superior to bona fide non-CBT treatments.

Abstract = {Which repair strategy does the language system deploy when it gets garden-pathed, and what can regressive eye movements in reading tell us about reanalysis strategies? Several influential eye-tracking studies on syntactic reanalysis (Frazier & Rayner, 1982; Meseguer, Carreiras, & Clifton, 2002; Mitchell, Shen, Green, & Hodgson, 2008) have addressed this question by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of eye fixations. However, in the absence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies relied on simplified dependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address the theoretical question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifies scanpath similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies associated with reanalysis that went undetected in a previously published data set (Meseguer et al., 2002). One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has been discussed in the literature (Frazier & Rayner, 1982); however, readers differed tremendously in how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results suggest that the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different strategies when confronted with the disambiguating material in garden-path sentences.

Abstract = {This article examines Japanese teachers’ beliefs about children’s peripheral participation in emotional interactions in the classroom, and especially in fights. The article is based on a reanalysis of scenes of fighting in Japanese preschools from Tobin and colleagues’ 2009 book and video, Preschool in Three Cultures Revisited. The reanalysis shifts the focus of attention from the protagonists in the fights, who occupy the center of the video frames, to the children on the margins. Japanese teachers have an emic cultural vocabulary for conceptualizing such peripheral participation, including the terms gyarari (gallery), gaiya (outfielders), seken (the generalized audience), and mawari no ko (the children around). Our analysis suggests that Japanese preschool teachers believe that in responding to children’s fights their goal should be to give not only the protagonists but the class as a whole opportunities to experience emotions and to cultivate a sense of collective responsibility for events in their classroom community.

Abstract = {Sentence comprehension is a complex process. Besides identifying the meaning of each word and processing the syntactic structure of a sentence, it requires the computation of thematic information, that is, information about who did what to whom. The present fMRI study investigated the neural basis for thematic reanalysis (reanalysis of the thematic roles initially assigned to noun phrases in a sentence) and its interplay with syntactic reanalysis (reanalysis of the underlying syntactic structure originally constructed for a sentence). Thematic reanalysis recruited a network consisting of Broca's area, that is, the left pars triangularis (LPT), and the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, whereas only LPT showed greater sensitivity to syntactic reanalysis. These data provide direct evidence for a functional neuroanatomical basis for two linguistically motivated reanalysis processes during sentence comprehension.

Abstract = {In this study, the influence of plausibility information on the real-time processing of locally ambiguous ("garden path") sentences in a nonnative language is investigated. Using self-paced reading, we examined how advanced Greek-speaking learners of English and native speaker controls read sentences containing temporary subject-object ambiguities, with the ambiguous noun phrase being either semantically plausible or implausible as the direct object of the immediately preceding verb. Besides providing evidence for incremental interpretation in second language processing, our results indicate that the learners were more strongly influenced by plausibility information than the native speaker controls in their on-line processing of the experimental items. For the second language learners an initially plausible direct object interpretation lead to increased reanalysis difficulty in "weak" garden-path sentences where the required reanalysis did not interrupt the current thematic processing domain. No such evidence of on-line recovery was observed, in contrast, for "strong" garden-path sentences that required more substantial revisions of the representation built thus far, suggesting that comprehension breakdown was more likely here.

Abstract = {We investigated the role of number agreement on verb and of animacy in the comprehension of subject and object relative clauses in 51 monolingual Italian-speaking children, mean age 9:33, tested through a self-paced listening experiment with a final comprehension question. A digit span test and a listening span test were also administered to examine the role of memory in comprehension. Subject relative clauses were easier to comprehend than object relative clauses; animacy of the relative clause head improved comprehension of object relative clauses; memory, as measured by the digit span test, modulates comprehension of object relative clauses, both with animate and inanimate heads, as shown in response accuracy. Although all children process number agreement morphology on the verb, only some perform a correct reanalysis, as shown by the accuracy measures. We argue that number agreement disambiguation is particularly taxing for children, as it provides a negative symptom in the sense of Fodor and Inoue (J Psycholinguist Res 29(1):25–36, 2000) and reanalysis requires them to hold two dependencies in memory.

Abstract = {Children acquiring their first languages are frequently regarded as the principal agents of diachronic change. The causes and the precise nature of the processes of change are, however, far from clear. The following discussion focuses on possible changes of core properties of grammars which, in terms of the theory of Universal Grammar, can be characterized as reflecting different settings of parameters. In such cases, learners develop grammatical competences differing from those of speakers of the previous generation who provided the primary data serving as input for the developmental processes. It has been argued that reanalyses of this type must be conceived of as instances of transmission failure. Yet acquisition research has demonstrated that the human Language Making Capacity is extraordinarily robust, thus leading to the question of what might cause unsuccessful acquisition. Changing frequencies in use or exposure to data containing ambiguous or even contradictory evidence are unlikely to suffice as causes for this to happen. Language acquisition in multilingual settings may be a more plausible source of grammatical reanalysis than monolingual first language development. The study of contemporary bilingualism can therefore contribute to an explanation of diachronic change. Yet one such insight is that simultaneous acquisition of two languages (2L1) typically leads to a kind of grammatical knowledge in each language which is qualitatively not different from that of the respective monolinguals, obliging us to look for other sources of transmission failure. 2LI acquisition in settings where one language is "weaker" than the other has been claimed to qualify as such. But I will argue that even such problematic cases do not provide convincing evidence of reanalysis. If, on the other hand, children receive sustained input from second language learners, or if their onset of acquisition is delayed, this can indeed lead to incomplete acquisition. I conclude that successive acquisition of bilingualism plays a crucial role as a source of grammatical change. In order for such changes to happen, however, grammar-internal and language-external factors may have to concur. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This article argues that it is frequency and usage effects, arising in particular contexts and constructions, that lead to the emergence of new semantic and syntactic properties in expressions that become discourse markers (DMs). These changes, it is argued, are comparable to those that take place in the development of other grammaticalizing linguistic items. DMs are taken to be sentence adverbials that express discourse-relational predications. Data from the histories of two English DMs, ‘instead’ and ‘rather’, are examined. These contrastive DMs are often interchangeable in present-day English but have very different origins, ‘instead’ deriving from the phrase ‘in (the) stead of NP’, and ‘rather’ from the comparative VP-adverb rather, meaning ‘sooner’ or ‘faster’. In each of the two cases, there is seen to be increased type frequency (with context expansion) and reanalysis (wider scope). The diachronic evidence supports the idea that the reanalysis resulted from wider interpretation, not from prior change in word order. As DMs, both ‘instead’ and ‘rather’ become associated with high informational salience. Both undergo functional split, leading to new polysemies. Insofar as the newer, DM senses are closer to the grammatical end of the lexical-grammatical cline, the expressions can be said to have grammaticalized. There is no evidence that any qualitatively special changes are involved in the emergence of the DM uses, compared with the developments of the other polysemies of the expressions.

Abstract = {Adolescent sexual health is a substantial problem in the United States, and two recent studies have linked adolescent sexual behavior and/or outcomes to youths' exposure to sex in the media. Both studies had longitudinal survey designs and used covariate-adjusted regression analysis. Steinberg and Monahan (2011) reanalyzed data from one of these studies (Brown et al., 2006) using a propensity score approach, arguing that this method better addresses the possibility of unobserved confounders. On the basis of their reanalysis, which found no relationship between media exposure and sexual behavior, Steinberg and Monahan concluded that “Adolescents' Exposure to Sexy Media Does Not Hasten the Initiation of Sexual Intercourse” (p. 562). We subjected data from the second study (Chandra et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2004) to reanalysis using a propensity-score approach. We find only modest reductions in two of the three previously documented associations and no reduction in the third. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that there is an association between exposure to sex in the media and adolescent sexual outcomes. Although the evidence does not prove causality, it is sufficient to advise caution among parents, develop interventions for youths, and work with media producers and distributors to reduce youth exposure to sexual content.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Prediction of self-reported knowledge with over-claiming, fluid and crystallized intelligence and typical intellectual engagement" by Gizem Hülür, Oliver Wilhelm and Stefan Schipolowski (Learning and Individual Differences, 2011[Dec], Vol 21[6], 742-746). The original publication contained an error that we detected during reanalyses in the context of a new study. Due to an error in data management the scores for crystallized intelligence were not correctly aligned with the rest of the dataset for a subset of participants. This error does not affect the main findings of the original study. Corrected versions of Tables 3 and 4 in the original publication are given. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-23462-001[/rid]). We investigated the usefulness of the Over-Claiming Questionnaire (OCQ) as a measure of cognitive abilities. In OCQs respondents are asked to rate their familiarity with items of academic or everyday knowledge (Paulhus, Harms, Bruce, & Lysy, 2003). Some items exist in reality (reals), and others do not (foils). We developed four OCQs, each consisting of 40 reals and 8 foils from the domains of Science, Humanities and Civics. The OCQs were administered in a longitudinal rotation design to 112 participants who attended the 9th school grade at the beginning of the study. In latent variable regression analyses 53% of variation in the reals could be explained by fluid and crystallized intelligence and over-claiming as indicated by responses to foils. Further variation in responses to reals and foils was explained by intellectual engagement. Our results show that self-reported knowledge, although positively related to measures of ability, to a large extent reflects over-claiming.

Abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) “anxiety, obsessive-compulsive spectrum, posttraumatic, and dissociative disorders” work group addressed reconceptualization issues regarding all anxiety-related disorders. Based on systematic literature reviews, reanalyses of available data and evaluation of results following the DSM-5 principles it was decided to rearrange the disorder spectrum into separate groupings for the classical anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and dissociative disorders. Among the classical anxiety disorders DSM-5 now also includes selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder. A major change from DSM-IV is a drastically simplified classification of panic disorder and agoraphobia. Both conditions can be separately coded in DSM-5 and the overlap is disclosed by a comorbid double diagnosis. The anxiety disorder criteria have been generally harmonized regarding content and order. It was assured that criteria are applicable to all age, gender and cultural groups. Furthermore, diagnosis-specific and cross-cutting dimensional anxiety scales have been developed to supplement categorical diagnosis which appears to facilitate assessment of severity and course of treatment.

Abstract = {Rationale and objective: Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) is used to treat depression, but the effectiveness has not been established. Recent guidelines described the analysis of clinical trials with missing data, inspiring the reanalysis of this trial using proper missing data methods. The objective was to determine whether hypericum was superior to placebo in treating major depression. Methods: A placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted for 8 weeks to determine the effectiveness of hypericum or sertraline in reducing depression, measured using the Hamilton depression scale. We performed sensitivity analyses under different assumptions about the missing data process. Results: Three hundred forty participants were randomized, with 28 % lost to follow-up. The missing data mechanism was not missing completely at random. Under missing at random assumptions, some sensitivity analyses found no difference between either treatment armand placebo, while some sensitivity analyses found a significant difference from baseline to week 8 between sertraline and placebo (−1.28, 95 % credible interval [−2.48; −0.08]), but not between hypericum and placebo (0.56, [−0.64;1.76]). The results were similar when the missing data process was assumed to be missing not at random. Conclusions: There is no difference between hypericum and placebo, regardless of the assumption about the missing data process. There is a significant difference between sertraline and placebo with some statistical methods used. It is important to conduct an analysis that takes account ofmissing data using valid statistically principled methods. The assumptions about the missing data process could influence the results.

Abstract = {Background: Annotated patient-provider encounters can provide important insights into clinical communication, ultimately suggesting how it might be improved to effect better health outcomes. But annotating outpatient transcripts with Roter or General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS) codes is expensive, limiting the scope of such analyses. We propose automatically annotating transcripts of patient-provider interactions with topic codes via machine learning. Methods: We use a conditional random field (CRF) to model utterance topic probabilities. The model accounts for the sequential structure of conversations and the words comprising utterances. We assess predictive performance via 10-fold cross-validation over GMIAS-annotated transcripts of 360 outpatient visits (> 230,000 utterances). We then use automated in place of manual annotations to reproduce an analysis of 116 additional visits from a randomized trial that used GMIAS to assess the efficacy of an intervention aimed at improving communication around antiretroviral (ARV) adherence. Results: With respect to 6 topic codes, the CRF achieved a mean pairwise kappa compared with human annotators of 0.49 (range: 0.47–0.53) and a mean overall accuracy of 0.64 (range: 0.62–0.66). With respect to the RCT reanalysis, results using automated annotations agreed with those obtained using manual ones. According to the manual annotations, the median number of ARV-related utterances without and with the intervention was 49.5 versus 76, respectively (paired sign test P = 0.07). When automated annotations were used, the respective numbers were 39 versus 55 (P = 0.04). While moderately accurate, the predicted annotations are far from perfect. Conversational topics are intermediate outcomes, and their utility is still being researched. Conclusions: This foray into automated topic inference suggests that machine learning methods can classify utterances comprising patient-provider interactions into clinically relevant topics with reasonable accuracy.

Abstract = {This article elaborates on evolutionary perspectives relevant to the meta-analytic portion of our recent review (Eastwick, Luchies, Finkel, & Hunt, 2014). We suggested that if men and women evolved sex-differentiated ideals (i.e., mate preferences), then they should exhibit sex-differentiated desires (e.g., romantic attraction) and/or relational outcomes (e.g., relationship satisfaction) with respect to live opposite-sex targets. Our meta-analysis revealed no support for these sex-differentiated desires and relational outcomes in either established relationship or mate selection contexts. With respect to established relationships, Schmitt (2014) has objected to the idea that relationship quality (one of our primarily romantic evaluation dependent measures) has functional relevance. In doing so, he neglects myriad evolutionary perspectives on the adaptive importance of the pair-bond and the wealth of data suggesting that relationship quality predicts the dissolution of pair-bonds. With respect to mate selection, Schmitt (2014) has continued to suggest that sex-differentiated patterns should emerge in these contexts despite the fact that our meta-analysis included this literature and found no sex differences. Schmitt (2014) also generated several novel sex-differentiated predictions with respect to attractiveness and earning prospects, but neither the existing literature nor reanalyses of our meta-analytic data reveal any support for his “proper” function-related hypotheses. In short, there are diverse evolutionary perspectives relevant to mating, including our own synthesis; Schmitt’s (2014) conceptual analysis is not the one-and-only evolutionary psychological view, and his alternative explanations for our meta-analytic data remain speculative.

Abstract = {Cultural life scripts (CLS) are culturally shared cognitive representations of the expected order and timing of important life events in a prototypical life. Through three studies data from Qatar were analysed and compared to previously collected data from Denmark, Turkey, and the US. In Study 1 we examined the CLS of Qatar in order to determine whether the clear segregation of men and women as well as the centrality of religion in this society would influence the CLS. A total of 55 Qatari undergraduates completed the standard CLS task, imaging a Qatari infant of their own as well as the opposite gender. In Study 2 important personal life story events were collected from 83 Qatari undergraduates in order to explore the overlap between remembered life events and CLS events. Study 3 was a reanalysis of CLS data from Denmark, Turkey, and the US. There was a considerable overlap of events across cultures, but we also found that the Qatari CLS showed more gender differences and contained more religious and positive events compared to the other three countries.

Abstract = {Purpose: In this study, the authors explored alternative gold standards to validate an innovative, dialect-neutral language assessment. Method: Participants were 78 African American children, ages 5;0 (years;months) to 6;11. Twenty participants had previously been identified as having language impairment. The Diagnostic Evaluation of Language Variation—Norm Referenced (DELV–NR; Seymour, Roeper, & J. de Villiers, 2005) was administered, and concurrent language samples (LSs) were collected. Using LS profiles as the gold standard, sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of diagnostic accuracy were compared for diagnoses made from the DELV–NR and participants’ clinical status prior to recruitment. In a second analysis, the authors used results from the first analysis to make evidence-based adjustments in the estimates of DELV–NR diagnostic accuracy. Results: Accuracy of the DELV–NR relative to LS profiles was greater than that of prior diagnoses, indicating that the DELV–NR was an improvement over preexisting diagnoses for this group. Specificity met conventional standards, but sensitivity was somewhat low. Reanalysis using the positive and negative predictive power of the preexisting diagnosis in a discrepant-resolution procedure revealed that estimates for sensitivity and specificity for the DELV–NR were .85 and .93, respectively. Conclusion: The authors found that, even after making allowances for the imperfection of available gold standards, clinical decisions made with the DELV–NR achieved high values on conventional measures of diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract = {This article presents a reanalysis of the data of 862 second and fourth graders collected in two previous studies, focusing on the influence of method (psychometric vs. chronometric) and stimulus type on the gender difference in mental-rotation accuracy. The children had to solve mental-rotation tasks with animal pictures, letters, or cube figures, either in a chronometric condition (computerized) or in a psychometric condition (paper-and-pencil). Results show a slight male advantage in mental-rotation accuracy, which is neither influenced by method nor by stimulus type. However, mental-rotation accuracy differed between the stimulus types, with the highest accuracy in animal pictures and the lowest accuracy in cube figures, and between age groups, with better performance in fourth graders than in second graders in both conditions. Results show that psychometric and chronometric mental-rotation tests with all the stimulus types are more or less similarly usable with children of that age.

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of inhaled thyrotropin-releasing hormone for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) displays multiple central nervous system-mediated actions that have therapeutic potential in treating a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Investigations of central nervous system functions and clinical use of TRH are hindered, however, because of its rapid degradation by circulating peptidases. To circumvent this problem, Veronesi et al. have developed an intranasal nanoparticle drug delivery system. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone could be introduced into the nasal cavity, where the olfactory neurons can collect particles directly. The TRH incorporated into biodegradable nanoparticles would dissolve at a controlled rate designed to deliver appropriate doses of the drug to the brain over time. Another approach would be to deliver TRH powder by inhalation. This is the specific delivery system addressed in this communication, whereas opposed to intranasal delivery of nanoparticles. This analysis of inhaled TRH pharmacokinetics suggests that further study of inhaled TRH for therapeutic purposes is warranted. It might be best to do the analysis first in an animal model, or even an animal model of depression, to measure the amount of TRH in the brain. The reanalysis of data presented previously was not part of the author's research group. Therefore, no institutional review board approval was indicated.

Abstract = {Studies of the belief bias effect in syllogistic reasoning have relied on three traditional difference score measures: the logic index, belief index, and interaction index. Dube, Rotello, and Heit (2010, 2011) argued that the interaction index incorrectly assumes a linear receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Here, all three measures are addressed. Simulations indicated that traditional analyses of reasoning experiments are likely to lead to incorrect conclusions. Two new experiments examined the role of instructional manipulations on the belief bias effect. The form of the ROCs violated assumptions of traditional measures. In comparison, signal detection theory (SDT) model-based analyses were a better match for the form of the ROCs, and implied that belief bias and instructional manipulations are predominantly response bias effects. Finally, reanalyses of previous studies of conditional reasoning also showed non-linear ROCs, violating assumptions of traditional analyses. Overall, reasoning research using traditional measures is at risk of drawing incorrect conclusions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Aim: To describe patterns of ‘online’ and ‘offline’ health information seeking in families with children under five years of age and living in five socially, economically and culturally disparate local authority (LA) wards in one inner-city area. Background: Earlier work analysed data from the five LA wards merged as one data set. A ‘digital divide’ in health information seeking was identified between parents who actively sought information from both internet websites and from 14 other health information sources (online health information seekers), and those who acquired information from a more limited range of sources excluding the internet. Of the two groups, the online health information seekers had higher levels of computer ownership and, therefore, internet access within the home. Method: Re-analysis of data (questionnaires n = 224; five focus groups; two interviews with service providers; two opportunistic conversations with service providers). Additional data were retrieved after the original data analysis and between 2005 and 2007. These data were from service user-led discussions (n = 30) held with parents in child health clinics, informal interviews (n = 11) with health visitors and semi-structured interviews (n = 2) with health visitors. Information was also retrieved from the Office for National Statistics data set. In the reanalysis, data were disaggregated at LA ward level in order to explore local influences on patterns of health information seeking. Results: Multiple layers of influence upon parental health information seeking emerged and revealed a non-digital second divide, which was independent of computer ownership and home internet access. This divide was based on preference for use of certain health information sources, which might be either ‘online’ or ‘offline’. A spatial patterning of both digital and preferential divides was identified with an association between each of these and features of the physical, social, cultural and psychosocial environment, one of which was perceived access to primary health care. Conclusion: Complex patterns of health information seeking relate to each of the ‘divides’—digital and preferential. Patterns of health information seeking reflect differing perceptions of information availability and usefulness as experienced by parents within their local physical, social, cultural and psychosocial worlds. Access to primary care services is a key component of this local environment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Prior research has shown a tendency for environmental problems to be rated as more severe at the global level than at the local level. The present article reports reanalyses of a large cross-cultural data set (Study 1: k = 22, N = 3,277) and new cross-cultural data (Study 2: k = 8, N = 1,131) examining the prevalence of this spatial bias in the rated severity of environmental problems along with analyses of individual and country-level predictors of this bias. Results from multilevel modeling analyses showed that spatial bias was greater for happier and younger individuals and for those from smaller communities. We interpret these results as evidence for self-serving and “place-serving” biases in which the bias tempers the severity of environmental problems in one’s local area. Considering the large cross-cultural evidence, we argue that spatial bias is a plausible candidate of a psychological universal identified by research in environmental psychology.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Attention and working memory capacity: Insights from blocking, highlighting, and knowledge restructuring" by David K. Sewell and Stephan Lewandowsky (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2012[Aug], Vol 141[3], 444-469). The article contained a data analysis error, stemming from incorrect data files for three participants being read into the analysis routine. All of the theoretical inferences based on the outcomes of statistical tests reported in the article are unchanged in light of the reanalysis. Although the significant reduction in fit that led the authors to opt for the two-factor structural equation model is now marginally significant, the two-factor interpretation of the data more cleanly characterizes two conceptually distinct constructs and thus is still the preferred model. The text corrections and two corrected figures are provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-29871-001[/rid].) The concept of attention is central to theorizing in learning as well as in working memory. However, research to date has yet to establish how attention as construed in one domain maps onto the other. We investigate two manifestations of attention in category- and cue-learning to examine whether they might provide common ground between learning and working memory. Experiment 1 examined blocking and highlighting effects in an associative learning paradigm, which are widely thought to be attentionally mediated. No relationship between attentional performance indicators and working memory capacity (WMC) was observed, despite the fact that WMC was strongly associated with overall learning performance. Experiment 2 used a knowledge restructuring paradigm, which is known to require recoordination of partial category knowledge using representational attention. We found that the extent to which people successfully recoordinated their knowledge was related to WMC. The results illustrate a link between WMC and representational—but not dimensional—attention in category learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of “inhibition of return” (IOR) has been the subject of considerable research interest for nearly 30 years. Two reports claiming directional biases in IOR (Spalek & Hammad, Perception & Psychophysics 66:219–233, 2004, Psychological Science 16:15–18, 2005) were examined more closely, as such findings challenge the theoretical role attributed to IOR and imply that this purported mechanism for the facilitation of visual search would bias search in systematic ways. The data from two new experiments, as well as reanalysis of the original data, showed the reports to result from an unconventional method of calculating IOR that confounded visual field with target location. Although we found significant differences in target detection response times between the visual fields, directional biases were absent from all of the examined data when the conventional method of computing IOR was applied.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Cognitive training with casual video games: Points to consider" by Pauline L. Baniqued, Michael B. Kranz, Michelle W. Voss, Hyunkyu Lee, Joshua D. Cosman, Joan Severson and Arthur F. Kramer (Frontiers in Psychology, 2014[Jan][7], Vol 4[1010]). In the original article, there was an error that does not impact the significant findings and does not invalidate any conclusions derived from the study. In the WM-REAS 2 group, the authors inadvertently included data from one subject whose performance in the Attention Network Test (ANT) during post-testing met the exclusionary criteria. This resulted in an exaggerated negative transfer effect for the WM-REAS 2 group. After excluding this subject, the WM-REAS ANT-selective attention, data is comparable with the other training groups. The results are consistent after reanalysis, with no significant transfer effect in ANT selective attention. The reported association between sleep and ANT-selective attention in the original publication is no longer significant. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-12339-001[/rid]). Brain training programs have proliferated in recent years, with claims that video games or computer-based tasks can broadly enhance cognitive function. However, benefits are commonly seen only in trained tasks. Assessing generalized improvement and practicality of laboratory exercises complicates interpretation and application of findings. In this study, we addressed these issues by using active control groups, training tasks that more closely resemble real-world demands and multiple tests to determine transfer of training. We examined whether casual video games can broadly improve cognition, and selected training games from a study of the relationship between game performance and cognitive abilities. A total of 209 young adults were randomized into a working memory–reasoning group, an adaptive working memory–reasoning group, an active control game group, and a nocontact control group. Before and after 15 h of training, participants completed tests of reasoning, working memory, attention, episodic memory, perceptual speed, and self-report measures of executive function, game experience, perceived improvement, knowledge of brain training research, and game play outside the laboratory. Participants improved on the training games, but transfer to untrained tasks was limited. No group showed gains in reasoning, working memory, episodic memory, or perceptual speed, but the working memory–reasoning groups improved in divided attention, with better performance in an attention-demanding game, a decreased attentional blink and smaller trail-making costs. Perceived improvements did not differ across training groups and those with low reasoning ability at baseline showed larger gains. Although there are important caveats, our study sheds light on the mixed effects in the training and transfer literature and offers a novel and potentially practical training approach. Still, more research is needed to determine the real-world benefits of computer programs such as casual games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is involved in perception as well as in declarative memory. Amnesic patients with focal MTL lesions and semantic dementia patients showed perceptual deficits when discriminating faces and objects. Interestingly, these two patient groups showed different profiles of impairment for familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. For MTL amnesics, the use of familiar relative to unfamiliar stimuli improved discrimination performance. By contrast, patients with semantic dementia—a neurodegenerative condition associated with anterolateral temporal lobe damage—showed no such facilitation from familiar stimuli. Given that the two patient groups had highly overlapping patterns of damage to the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal pole, the neuroanatomical substrates underlying their performance discrepancy were unclear. Here, we addressed this question with a multivariate reanalysis of the data presented by Barense et al. (2011), using functional connectivity to examine how stimulus familiarity affected the broader networks with which the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal poles interact. In this study, healthy participants were scanned while they performed an odd-one-out perceptual task involving familiar and novel faces or objects. Seed-based analyses revealed that functional connectivity of the right perirhinal cortex and right anterior hippocampus was modulated by the degree of stimulus familiarity. For familiar relative to unfamiliar faces and objects, both right perirhinal cortex and right anterior hippocampus showed enhanced functional correlations with anterior/lateral temporal cortex, temporal pole, and medial/lateral parietal cortex. These findings suggest that in order to benefit from stimulus familiarity, it is necessary to engage not only the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus, but also a network of regions known to represent semantic information.

Abstract = {In the context of multiple treatments for a particular problem or disorder, it is important theoretically and clinically to investigate whether any one treatment is more effective than another. Typically researchers report the results of the comparison of two treatments, and the meta-analytic problem is to synthesize the various comparisons of two treatments to test the omnibus null hypothesis that the true differences of all particular pairs of treatments are zero versus the alternative that there is at least one true nonzero difference. Two tests, one proposed by Wampold et al. (Psychol. Bull. 122:203–215, 1997) based on the homogeneity of effects, and one proposed here based on the distribution of the absolute value of the effects, were investigated. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation, both tests adequately maintained nominal error rates, and both demonstrated adequate power, although the Wampold test was slightly more powerful for non-uniform alternatives. The error rates and power were essentially unchanged in the presence of random effects. The tests were illustrated with a reanalysis of two published meta-analyses (psychotherapy and antidepressants). It is concluded that both tests are viable for testing the omnibus null hypothesis of no treatment differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Unlike many languages of Southeast Asia, Khmer (Cambodian) is not a tone language. However, in the colloquial speech of the capital Phnom Penh, /r/ is lost in onsets, reportedly supplanted by a range of other acoustic cues such as aspiration, a falling- or low-rising f0 contour, breathy voice quality, and in some cases diphthongization, e.g. /krɑː/‘poor’&gt;[k?ɑ], [kh?ɑ], [k??] /kruː/ ‘teacher’&gt; [k ùː], [khŭː], [kuː]. This paper presents the results of production and perception studies designed to shed light on this unusual sound change. Acoustic evidence shows that colloquial /CrV/ forms differ from reading pronunciation forms in terms of VOT, f0, and spectral balance measures, while a pair of perceptual studies demonstrate that f0 is a sufficient cue for listeners to distinguish underlying /CrV/-initial from /CV/-initial forms, but that F1 is not. I suggest that this sound change may have arisen via the perceptual reanalysis of changes in spectral balance, coupled with the coarticulatory influence of the dorsal gesture for /r/.

In this paper the development of two English prepositional subordinators of purpose is looked into using both perspectives, first functionalist then minimalist, resulting in a more variegated interpretation of the data. A subsequent juxtaposition of the two concepts of grammaticalization reveals that they complement each other to a large extent, the primary area of overlap being the notions of cyclicity and reanalysis. While the two concepts differ in, for example, the answer to the crucial question why grammaticalization takes place, a proposal is made that each model has potential for accommodating the insights from the other.

Abstract = {Background: The effects of antidepressants for treating depressive disorders have been overestimated because of selective publication of positive trials. Reanalyses that include unpublished trials have yielded reduced effect sizes. This in turn has led to claims that antidepressants have clinically insignificant advantages over placebo and that psychotherapy is therefore a better alternative. To test this, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing psychotherapy with pill placebo. Method: Ten 10 studies comparing psychotherapies with pill placebo were identified. In total, 1240 patients were included in these studies. For each study, Hedges’ g was calculated. Characteristics of the studies were extracted for subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Results: The effect of psychotherapy compared to pill placebo at post-test was g = 0.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14–0.36, I² = 0%, 95% CI 0–58]. This effect size corresponds to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7.14 (95% CI 5.00–12.82). The psychotherapy conditions scored 2.66 points lower on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) than the placebo conditions, and 3.20 points lower on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Some indications for publication bias were found (two missing studies). We found no significant differences between subgroups of the studies and in meta-regression analyses we found no significant association between baseline severity and effect size. Conclusions: Although there are differences between the role of placebo in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research, psychotherapy has an effect size that is comparable to that of antidepressant medications. Whether these effects should be deemed clinically relevant remains open to debate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The Risk Matrix 2000 is an actuarial risk assessment tool widely used in criminal-justice settings in the United Kingdom. It is used to provide expert opinions about the likely reoffending rates of offenders. Barnett, Wakeling, and Howard, (2010), recently published a large-scale study of the tool and argued that it demonstrated moderate accuracy of prediction. We have carried out a reanalysis of their data. Using logistic regression analysis, we demonstrate that 3 out the 7 risk variables are not associated with outcome; that is, proven sexual violence. Using natural frequency diagrams, we demonstrate that the uncertainty associated with predictions that any individual will offend is extremely large. We argue that the use of the Area Under the Curve statistic to evaluate the effectiveness of actuarial risk scales is fundamentally misleading. These findings have significant implications for the admissibility of actuarial risk scales in judicial and quasijudicial decision making.

Abstract = {In the current work, we aimed to study the processing of phonological, orthographical, and lexical information of Chinese characters in sentence contexts, as well as to provide further evidence for psychological models. In the experiment, we designed sentences with expected, homophonic, orthographically similar, synonymous, and control characters as endings, respectively. The results indicated that P200 might be related to the early extraction of phonological information. Moreover, it might also represent immediate semantic and orthographic lexical access. This suggested that there might be a dual-route in cognitive processing, where the direct access route and the phonologically mediated access route both exist and interact with each other. The increased N400 under the control condition suggested that both phonological and orthographical information would influence semantic integration in Chinese sentence comprehension. The two positive peaks of the late positive shift might represent the semantic monitoring, and orthographical retrieval and reanalysis processing, respectively. Under the orthographically similar condition, orthographical retrieval and reanalysis processing was more difficult in comparison with the other conditions, which suggested that there might be direct access from orthography to semantic representation in cognitive processing. In conclusion, it was shown that the direct access hypothesis or the dual-route hypothesis could better explain cognitive processing in the brain.

Abstract = {Successful comprehension of syntactically complex sentences depends on online language comprehension mechanisms as well as reanalysis in working memory. To differentiate the neural substrates of these processes, we recorded electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during sentence-picture-matching in healthy subjects, assessing the effects of two difficulty factors: syntactic complexity (object-embedded vs. subject-embedded relative clauses) and semantic reversibility on neuronal oscillations during sentence presentation, and during a subsequent memory delay prior to picture onset. Synthetic Aperture magnetometry analysis of MEG showed that semantic reversibility induced left lateralized perisylvian power decreases in a broad frequency range, approximately 8–30 Hz. This effect followed the relative clause presentation and persisted throughout the remainder of the sentence and the subsequent memory delay period, shifting to a more frontal distribution during the delay. In contrast, syntactic complexity induced enhanced power decreases only during the delay period, in bilateral frontal and anterior temporal regions. These results indicate that detailed syntactic parsing of auditory language input may be augmented in the absence of alternative cues for thematic role assignment, as reflected by selective perisylvian engagement for reversible sentences, compared with irreversible sentences in which world knowledge constrains possible thematic roles. Furthermore, comprehension of complex syntax appears to depend on post hoc reanalysis in working memory implemented by frontal regions in both hemispheres.

However, their arguments and reanalyses are both conceptually and methodologically problematic. We provide counterarguments and a reanalysis of the data considered by Gigerenzer and Brighton. Results clearly replicate previous findings, which are at odds with the claim that simple heuristics provide a general description of inferences for a majority of decision makers.

Abstract = {Duncan et al. (2007) examined associations between early behavioral and cognitive skills with later achievement. These associations were examined in 6 different data sets and results converged to suggest that early behavioral competences or problems had little, if any, prediction to later achievement and that attentional competences had small positive relations with later achievement. In contrast, cognitive abilities were by far the strongest predictors of achievement. We provide and investigate potential reasons why Duncan et al. found little to no association between behavior and later achievement in a reanalysis of data from 3 studies previously analyzed by Duncan et al. Potential reasons include the validity of the behavioral measures, treatment of the behavioral measures as continuous as opposed to categorical, and the choice of data analytic method. In this article, we discuss these issues at greater length and address them in our reanalysis. We also bring into question the nature of the relationship between behavior and achievement. Generally, our reanalysis supports the idea that attention measures are more predictive than behavioral measures; however, certain behavior measures showed small to moderate associations to concurrent levels of academic achievement and changes in academic achievement through elementary school.

Abstract = {Broca's area is preferentially activated by reversible sentences with complex syntax, but various linguistic factors may be responsible for this finding, including syntactic movement, working-memory demands, and post hoc reanalysis. To distinguish between these, we tested the interaction of syntactic complexity and semantic reversibility in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of sentence-picture matching. During auditory comprehension, semantic reversibility induced selective activation throughout the left perisylvian language network. In contrast, syntactic complexity (object-embedded vs. subject-embedded relative clauses) within reversible sentences engaged only the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and left precentral gyrus. Within irreversible sentences, only the LIFG was sensitive to syntactic complexity, confirming a unique role for this region in syntactic processing. Nonetheless, larger effects of reversibility itself occurred in the same regions, suggesting that full syntactic parsing may be a nonautomatic process applied as needed. Complex reversible sentences also induced enhanced signals in LIFG and left precentral regions on subsequent picture selection, but with additional recruitment of the right hemisphere homolog area (right inferior frontal gyrus) as well, suggesting that post hoc reanalysis of sentence structure, compared with initial comprehension, engages an overlapping but larger network of brain regions. These dissociable effects may offer a basis for studying the reorganization of receptive language function after brain damage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) is crucially has been found to be involved in syntactic processing of various kinds. This study investigates the cortical effects of two types of syntactic processes: (i) Reconstruction in ellipsis (recovery of left-out material given by context, More people have been to Paris than […] to Oslo), using pseudo-elliptical structures ('dead ends') as control (More people have been to Paris than I have). (ii) Reanalysis in the face of structural ambiguity in syntactic 'garden paths', where the parser initially assigns an incorrect structure and is forced to reanalyze. Reanalysis and reconstruction require additional syntactic processing and were predicted to increase activation in areas otherwise involved in structural computation: LIFG (BA 44,45), premotor BA 6, and posterior temporal BA 21,22. This was borne out. The results showed an interaction effect of the types of construction in all three areas reflecting syntactic processing.

Abstract = {Theories on the processing of compound words differ on the role attributed to access to individual constituents. These theories are mostly based on empirical evidence obtained in experimental settings that could induce artificial effects normally not occurring in natural processing. In this study we investigated the processing of compounds as compared to noncompound complex words in Italian through a reading task with eye movement recording. We included both head-initial and head-final compounds, in order to test whether the position of the head may influence the reading process. After ruling out the effects of length and frequency, we observed that pseudocompounds (i.e., words with a segment homograph to a real word in the leftmost part) elicited longer total reading times than all other types of complex words, including compounds. Furthermore, head-final compounds elicited longer total reading times than head-initial compounds. The results suggest that a word structure resembling a compound may induce longer processing, presumably related to unexpected morphological structures. The results also converge with previous evidence that in some cases there is a higher processing costs for head-final as opposed to head-initial compounds, possibly indexing a reanalysis of the stimulus in order to correctly assign the constituent properties. However, a deeper analysis restricted to compounds revealed a more complex scenario where several variables interact with headedness (namely, first and second constituent frequency, compound frequency, and compound length), and future studies are needed to discriminate among possible interpretations. Overall, our findings suggest that longer reading times are related to solving incongruities due to noncanonical structures, rather than to morphologically complexity per se.

Abstract = {Introduction: Children with epilepsy have frequent sleep disturbance and challenges in learning and memory. There is little research on the consolidation of memory during sleep in this population. The goal of this pilot study was to determine whether children with epilepsy are able to consolidate memories better after a sleep versus wake period as has been demonstrated in typically developing children. Methods: This study was a prospective evaluation of children with epilepsy to determine if sleep improved episodic memory (using word lists) as compared with memory following a wake period of similar duration. The study was conducted in patients in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at a single academic health science center. In the sleep recall condition, the learning trials were presented in the evening, and delayed recall of the words was tested in the morning. In the wake condition, the learning took place in the morning, and the delayed recall took place later in the day. Subjects wore an actigraph to evaluate sleep/wake patterns. Data regarding the children's epilepsy, antiepileptic medications, and frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges were also documented. Results: Ten children (agd 8–17 years) participated in the study. For the entire sample, recall after sleep was better than recall after awake (p = 0.03), and 7 of the 10 children showed this effect.However, reanalyses removing an outlier showed no difference between the two recall conditions. The mean number of interictal epileptiform discharges was 8.8 during the recall after sleep and 7.8 during the recall after awake. Three children had seizures during the evaluation. Conclusion: In this pilot study, we demonstrated that a small cohort of children with epilepsy, with similar interictal epileptiform discharges during sleep and wake, showed no advantage in memory for a word list after a period of sleep than after a period of being awake. This finding requires further study in a larger cohort. Poor memory consolidation during sleep may contribute to the cognitive deficits in children with epilepsy.

Abstract = {Dexterous behavior exhibits exquisite context sensitivity, implying the efficacy of exploration to detect the task-relevant information. Inspired by the recent finding that fractal scaling of exploratory movements predicts how well the movements sample available perceptual information, we investigate the possibility that dexterity of craftsmen would be characterized by fractal (long-range) temporal correlation properties of fluctuations in their movement wielding a tool. A reanalysis of hammering behavior involved in stone beads production in India (Nonaka & Bril, 2012) revealed the presence of long-range, power–law correlations, as part of multiplicative cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. In the unfamiliar condition using unusual material, the wielding behavior of highly skilled experts displayed a significant increase of long-range temporal correlations, whereas that of less experts exhibited a significant loss of long-range correlations and reduced heterogeneity of scaling properties over time, which robustly discriminated the groups with different skill levels. Alterations in long-range correlation properties of movement fluctuations are apparently associated with changes in the situation differently depending on the level of expertise.

Abstract = {Go or stay? This is presumably the dilemma people frequently find themselves in when contemplating separation after long years of marriage. Initially, the author reflects on the implications of ambivalence at a theoretical/conceptual level, subsequently applying these reflections to the situation of people looking back on longstanding relationships. A reanalysis of existing empirical data on people who have divorced at a late stage in life and reference to a relevant case example cast light on the significance of potential experiences of ambivalence in crucial situations generating tension in ongoing daily life. The author also takes into consideration an additional factor with a major potential impact: the specific historical features affecting the lives of people whose childhood was coeval with the Second World War. At a meta-analytic level, the conclusion the author arrives at is that experiences of ambivalence can be drawn upon constructively to yield up new insights in theory, research and (clinical) practice.

Abstract = {Twin studies are a major source of information about genetic effects on behavior, but they depend on a controversial assumption known as the equal environments assumption (EEA): that similarity in co-twins’ environments is not predictive of similarity in co-twin outcomes. Although evidence has largely supported the EEA, critics have claimed that environmental similarity has not been measured well, and most studies of the EEA have focused on outcomes related to health and psychology. This article addresses these limitations through (1) a reanalysis of data from the most cited study of the EEA, Loehlin and Nichols (1976), using better measures, and through (2) an analysis of nationally representative twin data from MIDUS using more comprehensive controls on a wider variety of outcomes than previous studies. Results support a middle ground position; it is likely that the EEA is not strictly valid for most outcomes, but the resulting bias is likely modest.

Abstract = {[Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 205(2) of The British Journal of Psychiatry (see record [rid]2014-32542-026[/rid]). An investigation carried out at the request of the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva has concluded that one of the authors (Alain Malafosse) fabricated methylation data. A reanalysis of the DNA reveals no significant correlation between childhood trauma and methylation of the NR3C1 gene. The original conclusions therefore no longer hold true and we wish to retract the paper.] Background: Early-life adversities represent risk factors for the development of bipolar affective disorder and are associated with higher severity of the disorder. This may be the consequence of a sustained alteration of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis resulting from epigenetic modifications of the gene coding for the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). Aims: To investigate whether severity of childhood maltreatment is associated with increased methylation of the exon 1F NR3C1 promoter in bipolar disorder. Method: A sample of people with bipolar disorder (n = 99) were assessed for childhood traumatic experiences. The percentage of NR3C1 methylation was measured for each participant. Results: The higher the number of trauma events, the higher was the percentage of NR3C1 methylation (β = 0.52, 95% CI 0.46–0.59, P << 0.0001). The severity of each type of maltreatment (sexual, physical and emotional) was also associated with NR3C1 methylation status. Conclusions: Early-life adversities have a sustained effect on the HPA axis through epigenetic processes and this effect may be measured in peripheral blood. This enduring biological impact of early trauma may alter the development of the brain and lead to adult psychopathological disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aims and objectives: To identify and compare hearing protection interventions for youth working and living on farms. Background: Noise-induced hearing loss represents a significant risk factor for injury, disability and death in agricultural populations due to an inability to receive sensory information that can indicate dangerous situations. Despite the availability of hearing protection devices, rates of utilisation remain low, while rates of noise-induced hearing loss are high within the agricultural youth population. Design: Comprehensive review of the literature. Method: Electronic database searches were conducted to identify research studies of hearing protection interventions for youth living or working on farms. Results: Three intervention studies were identified as meeting the review criteria, with additional reanalysis studies based on the original intervention studies. The intervention studies demonstrated increased use of hearing protection devices among youth who received the interventions compared to the control groups although audiometry testing results were not improved as a result of the intervention. Conclusions: The findings of this review highlight the need for additional research into the effectiveness of hearing protection device use as a noise-induced hearing loss preventative measure in youth who live or work on farms and the creation of effective interventions to increase hearing protection device use and decrease Noise-induced hearing loss risk. Relevance to clinical practice: It is recommended that nurses be educated in the areas of health promotion relevant to farming communities to be able to effectively meet their rural clients’ needs in relation to noise-induced hearing loss. Working with youth, families, and schools, as well as developing community partnerships, can facilitate the dissemination of hearing protection promotion.

Abstract = {Objectives: To examine the reciprocal effects of pain intensity and limitations in physical functioning over time. Methods: This study presents findings from a reanalysis of a 7-center trial conducted in Ontario, Canada, which included 209 adults with chronic knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to receive 28 days of therapy with an active solution (1.5% w/w diclofenac sodium in dimethyl sulfoxide) or 1 of 2 control solutions containing no diclofenac. The key outcome measures used in the current analyses were administered throughout the study period and assessed pain intensity, perceived activity limitations, and a composite score measuring both domains. A structural cross-lagged regression approach was used to determine the reciprocal effects of pain and activity limitations over time. Results: In both study groups, participants (N = 209) experienced significant reductions in mean pain intensity and activity limitations from baseline to weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 (P < 0.001 for both variables). Similarly, there were significant reductions in the activity limitations outcome at weeks 1 and 4 for the active versus control group (P < 0.05 for both). Higher levels of perceived activity limitations predicted more future pain at all time points. Cross-lagged associations in which pain predicted subsequent perceived activity limitations were not significant at any time point. All 3 outcome measures evidenced similar responsiveness to the treatment. Conclusion: These analyses showed that a decrease in activity limitations results in a decrease in pain intensity. However, changes in pain intensity had no effect on subsequent activity limitations in the study sample. None of the 3 outcome variables emerged as being more responsive to treatment than the others.

Abstract = {Prior research has linked religiosity to certain forms of self-enhancement. We extend this literature by three studies linking religiosity to the well-established better-than-average effect (BAE). First, a reanalysis of self-judgments of desirable characteristics in 15 nations showed that the BAE was stronger in more religious countries, even taking into account gross domestic product, interdependence, and economic inequality. Second, in two online surveys totaling 1,000 Americans, the BAE was stronger among more religious individuals. Several observations indicated that this relation was due to individuals self-stereotyping with respect to their religious in-groups. In particular, the relation was restricted to characteristics on the warmth dimension, consistent with the religious stereotype, and the average religious in-group member tended to be judged even more favorably than self. The latter phenomenon, which we term humble self-enhancement, is consistent with other studies linking stronger religiosity to greater favoritism of the religious in-group and greater derogation of religious out-groups.

Abstract = {That surface size has an impact on attention has been well-known in advertising research for almost a century; however, theoretical accounts of this effect have been sparse. To address this issue, we review studies on surface size effects on eye movements in this paper. While most studies find that large objects are more likely to be fixated, receive more fixations, and are fixated faster than small objects, a comprehensive explanation of this effect is still lacking. To bridge the theoretical gap, we relate the findings from this review to three theories of surface size effects suggested in the literature: a linear model based on the assumption of random fixations (Lohse, 1997), a theory of surface size as visual saliency (Pieters et al., 2007), and a theory based on competition for attention (CA; Janiszewski, 1998). We furthermore suggest a fourth model—demand for attention—which we derive from the theory of CA by revising the underlying model assumptions. In order to test the models against each other, we reanalyze data from an eye tracking study investigating surface size and saliency effects on attention. The reanalysis revealed little support for the first three theories while the demand for attention model showed a much better alignment with the data. We conclude that surface size effects may best be explained as an increase in object signal strength which depends on object size, number of objects in the visual scene, and object distance to the center of the scene. Our findings suggest that advertisers should take into account how objects in the visual scene interact in order to optimize attention to, for instance, brands and logos.

Abstract = {Context: Recent reviews have claimed that the script concordance test (SCT) methodology generally produces reliable and valid assessments of clinical reasoning and that the SCT may soon be suitable for high‐stakes testing. Objectives: This study is intended to describe three major threats to the validity of the SCT not yet considered in prior research and to illustrate the severity of these threats. Methods: We conducted a review of SCT reports available through the Web of Science database. Additionally, we reanalysed scores from a previously published SCT administration to explore issues related to standard SCT scoring practice. Results: Firstly, the predominant method for aggregate and partial credit scoring of SCTs introduces logical inconsistencies in the scoring key. Secondly, our literature review shows that SCT reliability studies have generally ignored inter‐panel, inter‐panellist and test–retest measurement error. Instead, studies have focused on observed levels of coefficient alpha, which is neither an informative index of internal structure nor a comprehensive index of reliability for SCT scores. As such, claims that SCT scores show acceptable reliability are premature. Finally, SCT criteria for item inclusion, in concert with a statistical artefact of the SCT format, cause anchors at the extremes of the scale to have less expected credit than anchors near or at the midpoint. Consequently, SCT scores are likely to reflect construct‐irrelevant differences in examinees' response styles. This makes the test susceptible to bias against candidates who endorse extreme scale anchors more readily; it also makes two construct‐irrelevant test taking strategies extremely effective. In our reanalysis, we found that examinees could drastically increase their scores by never endorsing extreme scale points. Furthermore, examinees who simply endorsed the scale midpoint for every item would still have outperformed most examinees who used the scale as it is intended. Conclusions: Given the severity of these threats, we conclude that aggregate scoring of SCTs cannot be recommended. Recommendations for revisions of SCT methodology are discussed.

Abstract = {What theories best characterise the parsing processes triggered upon encountering ambiguity, and what effects do these processes have on eye movement patterns in reading? The present eye-tracking study, which investigated processing of attachment ambiguities of an adjunct in Spanish, suggests that readers sometimes underspecify attachment to save memory resources, consistent with the good-enough account of parsing. Our results confirm a surprising prediction of the good-enough account: high-capacity readers commit to an attachment decision more often than low-capacity participants, leading to more errors and a greater need to reanalyse in garden-path sentences. These results emerged only when we separated functionally different types of regressive eye movements using a scanpath analysis; conventional eye-tracking measures alone would have led to different conclusions. The scanpath analysis also showed that rereading was the dominant strategy for recovering from garden-pathing. Our results may also have broader implications for models of reading processes: reanalysis effects in eye movements occurred late, which suggests that the coupling of oculo-motor control and the parser may not be as tight as assumed in current computational models of eye movement control in reading.

Abstract = {The opportunity to gamble has undergone rapid expansion with technology allowing for access to gambling products 24 h a day. This increased online availability challenges governments’ abilities to restrict access to gambling. Indeed, the ready access to multiple forms of gambling may potentially contribute to impaired control over urges for problem gamblers. The present study considered whether problem gamblers manifested a tendency to engage in multiple forms of gambling and identified forms of gambling which were more strongly related to problem gambling. In reanalyses of two surveys (Sample 1, N = 464, Sample 2, N = 1141), significant relationships accounting for between 11.3 and 13.5 % of the variance were found between the numbers of forms of gambling accessed and degree of problem. Participation in online poker, playing cards and sports wagering were linked to problem gambling. Access to multiple forms of gambling may pose difficulties for the tracking and control of gambling.

Abstract = {Recent research has focused on the "description-experience gap": while rare events are overweighted in description based decisions, people tend to behave as if they underweight rare events in decisions based on experience. Barron and Erev (2003) and Hertwig, Barron, Weber and Elke (2004) argue that such findings are substantive and call for a theory of decision making under risk other than Prospect Theory for decisions from experience. Fox and Hadar (2006) suggest that the discrepancy is due to sampling error: people are likely to sample rare events less often than objective probability implies, especially if their samples are small. A strand of papers has responded examining the necessity of sample error in the underweighting of rare events. The current paper extends the results of such contributions and further strengthens the evidence on underweighting. The first experiment shows that the discrepancy persists even when people sample the entire population of outcomes and make a decision under risk rather than under uncertainty. A reanalysis of Barron and Erev (2003) further reveals that the gap persists even when subjects observe the expected frequency of rare events. The second experiment shows that the gap exists in a repeated decision making paradigm that controls for sample biases and the “hot stove” effect. Moreover, while underweighting persists in actual choices, overweighting is observed in judged probabilities. The results of the two experiments strengthen the suggestion that descriptive theories of choice that assume overweighting of small probabilities are not useful in describing decisions from experience. This is true even when there is no sample error, for both decisions under risk and for repeated choices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Traditionally Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) has been seen as a unidimensional construct. Recently, however, researchers have begun to measure three distinct RWA dimensions (Feldman, 2003; Funke, 2005; Van Hiel, Cornelis, Roets, & De Clercq, 2006). One of these new multidimensional RWA approaches has conceptualized these three dimensions as Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and Traditionalism (ACT), which are viewed as expressions of basic social values or motivational goals that represent different, though related, strategies for attaining collective security at the expense of individual autonomy. Findings are reported from two studies to assess the validity and predictive utility of the multidimensional ACT approach. First, a direct cross‐national comparison showed that the three ACT dimensions were reliable and factorially distinct and demonstrated the measurement invariance of the three latent constructs across Serbian and NZ (New Zealand) samples. The three ACT dimensions predicted self‐reported behavior differentially in both samples, and a comparison of latent means showed the Serbian sample higher than the NZ sample on the ACT dimensions of Authoritarianism and Traditionalism but markedly lower on Conservatism. Second, a reanalysis of previously collected NZ data showed that the three ACT scales differentially predicted three dimensions of generalized prejudice in a theoretically meaningful manner. These findings underline the importance of studying ideological attitudes, such as RWA, multidimensionally. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Our analysis focuses on the availability of data on battle deaths within specific conflict-years and problems encountered when data from multiple types of sources are combined. We repeat Lacina, Gleditsch, and Russett’s analysis of battle deaths over time, with an attempt to provide a more robust model and incorporate an estimate of the uncertainty present in the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset. This reanalysis reveals that the data used to establish the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset does not offer a clear answer as to whether battle deaths have decreased or increased since the end of the Second World War. We contend that while the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset offers the most comprehensive assembly of battle deaths data available to date, it is not suitable for analysis across countries or over time.

(see record [rid]2014-42081-007[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2014-42081-003[/rid]). Assuming a weak correlation between male and female testosterone levels, we did not consider alternative explanations for correlated evolution of testosterone due to one sex constraining the expression of testosterone in the other sex. In his thoughtful reanalysis of female testosterone data, Garamszegi made us think about the correlation of testosterone in males and females in greater depth. For the reasons given in our main article, we still consider it unlikely that one sex constrains the expression of circulating testosterone in the other sex. In our response, we offer an alternative explanation as to why female and male testosterone concentrations may be correlated. It is up to future research to determine whether the existing correlation is due to constraints or due to a common response to environmental factors that shape testosterone profiles in females and males in a similar manner. The length of the breeding season could indeed represent such a common factor, in this case leading to similar selection pressures in male and female birds.

Abstract = {Reply by the current author to the comments made by Aaron Gullickson and Vincent Kang Fu (see record [rid]2010-04501-007[/rid]) and Matthijs Kalmijn (see record [rid]2010-04501-008[/rid]) on the original article A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection by Michael J. Rosenfeld (2005). Gullickson and Fu propose a different way to measure status-caste exchange within loglinear models. The parameter they propose has technical advantages over the parameter I used in my article. All the models from my article that supported status-caste exchange theory (hereafter SCE theory) still support SCE theory using Gullickson and Fu’s parameter. Gullickson and Fu’s reanalysis does not overturn my results; on the contrary, their models and mine yield the same substantive results. Kalmijn argues that the differences in educational attainment between men and women, and between blacks and whites, could mask the evidence for SCE in summary statistics. My disagreement with Kalmijn is similar to my disagreement with Gullickson and Fu: Kalmijn’s evidence for SCE is entirely dependent on the particular loglinear models he chooses. Like Gullickson and Fu, Kalmijn rests his entire argument on loglinear models that fit the data poorly. Reanalysis easily overturns findings in favor of SCE theory for a simple reason: there is very little support for SCE theory in the data.

Abstract = {In the language domain, most studies of error monitoring have been devoted to language production. However, in language perception, errors are made as well and we are able to detect them. According to the monitoring theory of language perception, a strong conflict between what is expected and what is observed triggers reanalysis to check for possible perceptual errors, a process reflected by the P600. This is at variance with the dominant view that the P600 reflects syntactic reanalysis or repair, after syntactic violations or ambiguity. In the present study, the prediction of the monitoring theory of language perception was tested, that only a strong conflict between expectancies triggers reanalysis to check for possible perceptual errors, reflected by the P600. Therefore, we manipulated plausibility, and hypothesized that when a critical noun is mildly implausible in the given sentence (e.g., "The eye consisting of among other things a pupil, iris, and eyebrow . . ."), a mild conflict arises between the expected and unexpected event; integration difficulties arise due to the unexpectedness but they are resolved successfully, thereby eliciting an N400 effect. When the noun is deeply implausible however (e.g., "The eye consisting of among other things a pupil, iris, and sticker . . ."), a strong conflict arises; integration fails and reanalysis is triggered, eliciting a P600 effect. Our hypothesis was confirmed; only when the conflict between the expected and unexpected event is strong enough, reanalysis is triggered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A successful reciprocal evaluation of social signals serves as a prerequisite for social coherence and empathy. In a previous fMRI study we studied naturalistic communication situations by presenting video clips to our participants and recording their behavioral responses regarding empathy and its components. In two conditions, all three channels transported congruent emotional or neutral information, respectively. Three conditions selectively presented two emotional channels and one neutral channel and were thus bimodally emotional. We reported channel-specific emotional contributions in modality-related areas, elicited by dynamic video clips with varying combinations of emotionality in facial expressions, prosody, and speech content. However, to better understand the underlying mechanisms accompanying a naturalistically displayed human social interaction in some key regions that presumably serve as specific processing hubs for facial expressions, prosody, and speech content, we pursued a reanalysis of the data. Here, we focused on two different descriptions of temporal characteristics within these three modality-related regions [right fusiform gyrus (FFG), left auditory cortex (AC), left angular gyrus (AG) and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)]. By means of a finite impulse response (FIR) analysis within each of the three regions we examined the post-stimulus time-courses as a description of the temporal characteristics of the BOLD response during the video clips. Second, effective connectivity between these areas and the left dmPFC was analyzed using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in order to describe condition-related modulatory influences on the coupling between these regions. The FIR analysis showed initially diminished activation in bimodally emotional conditions but stronger activation than that observed in neutral videos toward the end of the stimuli, possibly by bottom-up processes in order to compensate for a lack of emotional information. The DCM analysis instead showed a pronounced top-down control. Remarkably, all connections from the dmPFC to the three other regions were modulated by the experimental conditions. This observation is in line with the presumed role of the dmPFC in the allocation of attention. In contrary, all incoming connections to the AG were modulated, indicating its key role in integrating multimodal information and supporting comprehension. Notably, the input from the FFG to the AG was enhanced when facial expressions conveyed emotional information. These findings serve as preliminary results in understanding network dynamics in human emotional communication and empathy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A disorder of impulsive aggression has been in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) since the first edition. In DSM-III, this disorder was codified as Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) and was thought to be rare. However, DSM criteria for IED were poorly operationalized and empiric research in IED was limited until the past decade when research criteria were developed. Subsequently, renewed interest in disorders of impulsive aggression led to a recent series of community based studies that have now documented IED to be as common as many other psychiatric disorders. Recent research indicates that the core of IED (A criteria) can be captured with new criteria that identify high frequency/low intensity aggressive outbursts (A1) and low frequency/hi intensity outbursts (A2). This paper presents new data regarding the phenomenology, comorbidity/life course of IED as a function of A1 and A2 criteria. Together with reanalysis of previously published data regarding family history, biomarkers, and treatment response in individuals with recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggression, these data provide empirical support for both A1 and A2 criteria for DSM-5 IED.

Abstract = {Research on the effects of the spatial correlation between signal and response key has shown a clear relationship between signal/response spatial correlation and reaction time (RT) for signals and response keys that are in a linear relationship (Morin and Grant 1955; Hoffmann 2010). By means of a reanalysis of previous data of Chan and Chan (2009a, 2009b, 2011a, 2011b, 2010), the equivalent relationships for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) display/control relationships are established. In a 2D array of signals with a corresponding 2D array of response keys, RT is dependent on spatial correlation, with arrangements having transverse compatibility reacting faster than those with longitudinal compatibility. 3D arrangements show a similar effect, with up/down compatibility being a major factor in determination of RT and with similar effects of transverse compatibility. The results indicate the best arrangements of signal/key arrangements where complex designs are necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The previously published randomized controlled trial, EARLY, tested the efficacy of a motivational interviewing (MI) plus feedback condition against a video information (VI) condition and an informational brochure (IB) condition in reducing drinking and/or increasing contraception effectiveness, and found that drinking and rates of effective contraception improved in all conditions. In this reanalysis of the data from EARLY, potential moderating effects of depressive, global distress, and anxiety symptoms in response to the three brief interventions to reduce alcohol exposed pregnancy risk were examined. Women with higher levels of depression at baseline reported greater improvements in the MI plus feedback condition versus the VI and IB conditions with depression moderating both drinking and contraceptive effectiveness. Global distress moderated only drinking behavior in the MI plus feedback but not other groups and anxiety was not a moderator of outcome in any of the intervention groups. Depressed or distressed women at risk for AEP may benefit from an AEP risk reduction intervention that incorporates interaction with a treatment provider versus educational information provided via video or written materials.

Abstract = {Objective: In this paper we evaluate the evidence for sex differences in fetal programming within the context of the proposed viability–vulnerability tradeoff. Methods: We briefly review the literature on the factors contributing to primary and secondary sex ratios. Sex differences in fetal programming are assessed by summarizing previously published sex difference findings from our group (6 studies) and also new analyses of previously published findings in which sex differences were not reported (6 studies). Results: The review and reanalysis of studies from our group are consistent with the overwhelming evidence of increasing risk for viability among males exposed to environmental adversity early in life. New evidence reported here support the argument that females, despite their adaptive agility, also are influenced by exposure to early adversity. Two primary conclusions are (i) female fetal exposure to psychobiological stress selectively influences fear/anxiety, and (ii) the effects of female fetal exposure to stress persist into preadolescence. These persisting effects are reflected in increased levels of anxiety, impaired executive function and neurological markers associated with these behaviors. Conclusions: A tacit assumption is that females, with their adaptive flexibility early in gestation, escape the consequences of early life exposure to adversity. We argue that the consequences of male exposure to early adversity threaten their viability, effectively culling the weak and the frail and creating a surviving cohort of the fittest. Females adjust to early adversity with a variety of strategies, but their escape from the risk of early mortality and morbidity has a price of increased vulnerability expressed later in development.

Abstract = {The aim of the present paper was to apply the ex-Gaussian function to data reported by Parris et al. (2012) given its utility in studies involving the Stroop task. Parris et al. showed an effect of the word blindness suggestion when Response-Stimulus Interval (RSI) was 500 ms but not when it was 3500 ms. Analysis revealed that: (1) The effect of the suggestion on interference is observed in μ, supporting converging evidence indicating the suggestion operates over response competition mechanisms; and, (2) Contrary to Parris et al. an effect of the suggestion was observed in μ when RSI was 3500 ms. The reanalysis of the data from Parris et al. (2012) supports the utility of ex-Gaussian analysis in revealing effects that might otherwise be thought of as absent. We suggest that word reading itself is not suppressed by the suggestion but instead that response conflict is dealt with more effectively.

Abstract = {Objective: An association between bipolar disorder and cognitive impairment has repeatedly been described, even for euthymic patients. Findings are inconsistent both across primary studies and previous meta-analyses. This study reanalysed 31 primary data sets as a single large sample (N = 2876) to provide a more definitive view. Method: Individual patient and control data were obtained from original authors for 11 measures from four common neuropsychological tests: California or Rey Verbal Learning Task (VLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), Digit Span and/or Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Results: Impairments were found for all 11 test-measures in the bipolar group after controlling for age, IQ and gender (Ps ≤ 0.001, E.S. = 0.26–0.63). Residual mood symptoms confound this result but cannot account for the effect sizes found. Impairments also seem unrelated to drug treatment. Some test-measures were weakly correlated with illness severity measures suggesting that some impairments may track illness progression. Conclusion: This reanalysis supports VLT, Digit Span and TMT as robust measures of cognitive impairments in bipolar disorder patients. The heterogeneity of some test results explains previous differences in meta-analyses. Better controlling for confounds suggests deficits may be smaller than previously reported but should be tracked longitudinally across illness progression and treatment.

Abstract = {The matching law, regardless of the version, is a mathematical model that accounts for an organism’s response rate as a function of the reinforcer rate. McDowell (2013) investigated to which extent a combined version of the quantitative law of effect (Herrnstein, 1970) and the generalized matching law (Baum, 1974) accounts for a substantial amount of the variance through several data sets. Even if I agree with most points raised by McDowell, there are 2 important issues within his reanalysis. Two out of 6 studies relied on pooled-subject data that are inappropriate for an investigation of the matching law (Caron, 2013). Moreover, the combined equation was not systemically investigated through all data sets. The current study casts some doubt on the empirical status of modern matching equations and thus shows that they still deserve extensive attention.

Abstract = {In a reanalysis of data from Cousineau and Shiffrin (2004) and two new visual search experiments, we used a likelihood ratio test to examine the full distributions of reaction time (RT) for evidence that the display size effect is a mixture-type effect that occurs on only a proportion of trials, leaving RT in the remaining trials unaffected, as is predicted by serial self-terminating search models. Experiment 1 was a reanalysis of Cousineau and Shiffrin’s data, for which a mixture effect had previously been established by a bimodal distribution of RTs, and the results confirmed that the likelihood ratio test could also detect this mixture. Experiment 2 applied the likelihood ratio test within a more standard visual search task with a relatively easy target/distractor discrimination, and Experiment 3 applied it within a target identification search task within the same types of stimuli. Neither of these experiments provided any evidence for the mixture-type display size effect predicted by serial self-terminating search models. Overall, these results suggest that serial self-terminating search models may generally be applicable only with relatively difficult target/distractor discriminations, and then only for some participants. In addition, they further illustrate the utility of analysing full RT distributions in addition to mean RT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Monitoring is an aspect of executive control that entails the detection of errors and the triggering of corrective actions when there is a mismatch between competing responses or representations. In the language domain, research of monitoring has mainly focused on errors made during language production. However, in language perception, for example while reading or listening, errors occur as well and people are able to detect them. A hypothesis that was developed to account for these errors is the monitoring hypothesis for language perception. According to this account, when a strong expectation conflicts with what is actually observed, a reanalysis is triggered to check the input for processing errors reflected by the P600 component. In contrast to what has been commonly assumed, the P600 is thought to reflect a general reanalysis and not a syntactic reanalysis. In this review, we will describe the different studies that led to this hypothesis and try to extend it beyond the language domain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Our study attracted critique related to the choice of MDS methodology. This response contains additional results from reanalyses of our data, obtained by carefully following the suggestions from the critics. However, the recommended reanalyses did not yield results substantially better than those from our prior attempt to replicate the findings by Center and Heritage (1990).

Abstract = {Comments on an article by P. F. Sullivan et al. (see record [rid]2009-04906-006[/rid]). This first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for major depressive disorder (MDD) has implicated the pre-synaptic protein, Piccolo, but results from multiple replication cohorts remained inconclusive. Here, we present a reanalysis of the Piccolo replication study and argue that the data favor a non-synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a well-characterized protein domain to be a causal risk factor for major depression. From the reanalysis, we conclude that Sullivan et al. provide convincing evidence for the potentially causal association of the non-synonymous coding SNP rs2522833 in PCLO/Piccolo with MDD.

Abstract = {Constraint-based lexical models of language processing assume that readers resolve temporary ambiguities by relying on a variety of cues, including particular knowledge of how verbs combine with nouns. Previous experiments have demonstrated verb bias effects only in structurally complex sentences, and have been criticized on the grounds that such effects could be due to a rapid reanalysis stage in a two-stage modular processing system. In a self-paced reading experiment and an eyetracking experiment, we demonstrate verb bias effects in sentences with simple structures that should require no reanalysis, and thus provide evidence that the combinatorial properties of individual words influence the earliest stages of sentence comprehension.

We thank Dr Little for his interest in our article. Dr Little is correct in that "[t]he VISTA database does not sanction reanalysis of any trial data that will test treatment effects…." However, our observational study did not set out to reanalyze the efficacy of a given thrombolytic agent, but rather to assess the impact of thrombolytic agents administered as part of routine clinical practice in acute stroke trials of neuroprotective agents. We should also emphasize that our study should only be viewed as hypothesis generating. Indeed, the observation that older patients with more severe strokes gain more from intravenous thrombolysis treatment on an absolute scale simply leads to the conclusion that this group of patients may not necessarily have to be denied treatment just on the basis of age or stroke severity and that more study of intravenous thrombolysis use in elderly patients with severe strokes is needed.

The authors feel that, in the original article, the presented findings are not currently sufficiently robust to provide definitive support for the conclusions of the paper, and that an extensive reanalysis of the data is required. The authors have therefore unanimously decided to retract this paper at this time. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-27765-012[/rid]). Functional interactions between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during working memory have been studied extensively as an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. Coupling abnormalities have been found in patients, their unaffected siblings, and carriers of common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, but the global genetic architecture of this imaging phenotype is unclear. To achieve genome-wide hypothesisfree identification of genes and pathways associated with prefrontal– hippocampal interactions, we combined gene set enrichment analysis with whole-genome genotyping and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 269 healthy German volunteers. We found significant enrichment of the synapse organization and biogenesis gene set. This gene set included known schizophrenia risk genes, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, beta 2 subunit (CACNB2), as well as genes with well-defined roles in neurodevelopmental and plasticity processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and have mechanistic links to prefrontal–hippocampal functional interactions. Our results demonstrate a readily generalizable approach that can be used to identify the neurogenetic basis of systems-level phenotypes. Moreover, our findings identify gene sets in which genetic variation may contribute to disease risk through altered prefrontal– hippocampal functional interactions and suggest a link to both ongoing and developmental synaptic plasticity.

To determine whether there was a relationship we computed the vector correlation between the Flynn effects (d) and the change in the g loading (Δg) between measurement occasions for each of the 10 NIT subtests and for each of the seven cohort comparisons, giving a total N of 70 effect sizes. The association between d and Δg was robustly negative (indicating that the Flynn effects were negatively associated with changes in the g loading of subtests) for all cohort comparisons, with values of r ranging from −.100 to −.461 (N = 10). When all effect sizes were analyzed together, the vector correlation was found to be −.281 (p ≤ .05, N = 70). This indicates a significant association between the Flynn effect and ability differentiation. Possible causes of this association are discussed.

Abstract = {We employ Positioning Theory in a reanalysis of data from postconflict reconciliation conversations between Jo Berry, whose father was killed in an IRA bombing, and Patrick Magee, who planted the bomb. The analysis shows how discourse activity simultaneously positions not just the Self and the Other as individuals, but also in dialogic relation to each other, whereby multilayered identities are revealed, negotiated, and shifted. This article has several aims. First, it introduces the new construct, Empathic Mutual Positioning, to describe a key dynamic in reconciliation through which mutual recognition and understanding is made possible for both speakers. It shows how Empathic Mutual Positioning drives the process of reconciliation, and how it evolves and changes as conciliation proceeds. The article illustrates the three functions of Empathic Mutual Positioning: expansive, embracing, and reflexive, and it argues that Empathic Mutual Positioning is a key, distinctive, and essential component in reconciliation processes. As an intentional commitment to conciliation it operates as a force, but it is also a dynamic psychic process in that it changes the people involved while unfolding. Second, the article discusses the potential benefits of applying Empathic Mutual Positioning as a strategic approach to conciliation by mediators engaged in reconciliation practice. Mediators can encourage, support, or exploit Empathic Mutual Positioning to scaffold the process and support participants at difficult points in the conciliation. Finally, it discusses how this new concept, Empathic Mutual Positioning, relates to the Positioning-Interests-Needs model widely used in mediated practical work in conflict resolution/transformation.

Abstract = {In previous studies we demonstrated that the speech of a language-acquiring child and that of her parent can be characterized as a transactional process of dynamic adaptation. We reported a striking attunement between child and parent in the global development of mean length of utterance and utterance length between the ages of 1.5 and 2.5 years. Here we present a reanalysis of these data, focusing on the utilization of different categories of utterance length. In particular we analyzed the temporal structure of the dialogue on the linguistic level using the technique of cross-recurrence quantification. This type of analysis enabled us to study the interaction between interlocutors at the microlevel, revealing the dynamics of child-parent conversation and how this changes over time. Results showed decreasing values for measures quantifying the vertical line structures as well as an increasing average length of the diagonal lines in the recurrence plot. This was interpreted as indicating an increasing flexibility in the patterns of parent-child dialogue over the period of 1 year. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Scaling arises in a wide array of neurophysiological and behavioral systems. A general basis for the emergence of these patterns in biological systems remains under debate. How- ever, biological processes that themselves unfold on timescales ranging from fast to slow often express fractal scaling. One possible basis for self-similar fractal distributions arising for cognitive activity is the fundamental mismatch between relative biological time and absolute clock time.

Abstract = {Binary choice tasks, such as 2-alternative forced choice, show a complex yet consistent pattern of sequential effects, whereby responses and response times depend on the detailed pattern of prior stimuli going back at least 5 trials. We show this pattern is well explained by simultaneous incremental learning of 2 simple statistics of the trial sequence: the base rate and the repetition rate. Both statistics are learned by the same basic associative mechanism, but they contribute different patterns of sequential effects because they entail different representations of the trial sequence. Subtler aspects of the data that are not explained by these 2 learning processes alone are explained by their interaction, via learning from joint error correction. Specifically, the cue-competition mechanism that has explained classic findings in animal learning (e.g., blocking) appears to operate on learning of sequence statistics. We also find that learning of the base rate and repetition rate are dissociated into response and stimulus processing, respectively, as indicated by event-related potentials, manipulations of stimulus discriminability, and reanalysis of past experiments that eliminated stimuli or prior responses. Thus, sequential effects in these tasks appear to be driven by learning the response base rate and the stimulus repetition rate. Connections are discussed between these findings and previous research attempting to separate stimulus- and response-based sequential effects, and research using sequential effects to determine mental representations. We conclude that sequential effects offer a powerful means for uncovering representations and learning mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the processing correlates of core verb features used to generate verb typologies. The aim was to contrast the effects of verb internal structure (as in semantic/conceptual features e.g., Jackend off [1991]; Levin and Rappaport Hovav [2005]) with argument structure and argument realization in sentence processing. To this end, we designed a self-paced reading task with internal structure and argument realization as variables in verb processing. Results showed that absence of a prototypical Agent or mismatch between thematic hierarchies and argument realization yields longer processing times possibly due to some form of thematic reanalysis or as a reaction to a “surprise” effect by the human processor while detecting a non-expected thematic assignment. No effects of verb internal structure were found. We take this result as an indication that argument structure and argument realization play an important role in verb recognition during sentence processing. We further propose that this reflects their prominent role in verb representation and we suggest that this finding could give additional support to verb classifications based on verb argument structure features compared to those based on internal structure.

Abstract = {An analysis of students’ conceptions on climate change shows a great confusion on key aspects of global warming. Even after instruction students often hold conceptions that differ from scientists’ conceptions. Student’s conceptions on global warming were collected in a reanalysis of 24 studies on everyday concepts of global warming as well as in an own interview study with 35 18-year-old students from German grammar schools. Climate-scientists conceptions were analysed from textbooks and research reports in a literature study. All data were analysed by systematic metaphor analysis and qualitative content analysis. Experientialism as a theory of metaphor provided insight in the process of understanding. The analysis of conceptions by experientialism shows that students and scientists have different metaphorical conceptions of global warming—but both refer to the same schemata. These schemata in mind we categorised the conceptions of global warming. Hereby we identified different thinking patterns in students’ and scientists’ conceptions. Following the model of educational reconstruction we took the metaphorical conceptions as a starting point for the development of learning environments. By uncovering the—mostly unconsciously – employed schemata, we gave students access to their metaphorical conceptions and let them reflect on their mental models.

Abstract = {Most research on animal vocal communication analyses frequency measurements on a linear scale, but the mechanisms of pitch perception and of certain aspects of vocal production are better described on a logarithmic scale, that is, as frequency ratios. Thus, for the majority of questions in vocal communication it is advisable to use log-transformed frequency, and the objective of this article is to encourage researchers to adopt this procedure. To illustrate this transition in methodology, I present two reanalyses of work on vocal communication, at the within- and among-species levels. Changing from linear to logarithmic scales yielded qualitatively identical conclusions, even in the among-species example where larger differences in absolute frequency can weaken the correlation between measurements at these two scales. These results suggest that conclusions of past work should generally be robust, at least when the absolute frequencies being compared do not diverge excessively. Results became stronger in the among-species example, suggesting that, as expected, frequency logarithms improve the ability to demonstrate biological phenomena. I hope that this discussion will motivate researchers to analyse frequency on a logarithmic scale for most research goals on vocal communication.

Abstract = {Background: Whereas some studies have shown clear evidence for an augmentation effect of D-cycloserine (DCS) on exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, other studies have shown weak effects or no effect at all. Some preclinical data suggest that the DCS augmentation effect is moderated by the success of extinction learning. Therefore, we conducted a reanalysis of existing data to examine whether the effects of DCS on clinical outcome would vary as a function of response to the exposure session (i.e., exposure success). Methods: In a clinical trial, patients with height phobia received two sessions involving 30 minutes of virtual reality exposure therapy and were randomly assigned to a pill placebo (n = 14) or 50 mg of DCS (n = 15) immediately after each session. Results: Mixed-effects regression analysis showed that the effects of DCS administration on clinical improvement was moderated by the level of fear experienced just before concluding exposure sessions. Patients receiving DCS exhibited significantly greater improvement in symptoms relative to patients who received placebo when fear was low at the end of the exposure. In contrast, when end fear was still elevated, patients receiving DCS improved less compared with those receiving placebo. Conclusions: D-cycloserine appears to enhance the benefits of exposure treatment when applied after a successful session, but it seems to have detrimental effects when administered after inadequate/unsuccessful exposure sessions.

Abstract = {The purpose of this letter is to update readers about the risk of major affective disorder following prenatal exposure to influenza, including a reanalysis of the Finnish data and a review of the literature. The investigations in Finland concerned people born in Uusimaa County, a region including greater Helsinki, who had been admitted to one or more of the eight mental hospitals in this county. The influenza epidemic lasted from 8 October 1957 to 14 November 1957. Patients who were potentially exposed during prenatal life (born 15 November 1957 to 14 August 1958) were classified as born during the index period, while those born in corresponding periods in the previous six years (1951–1956) were considered to have been born during the control period. While our reanalysis of the Finnish data supports the original findings of an increased risk of major affective disorder following prenatal exposure to the 1957 pandemic, the hypothesis is not supported by studies from other regions and of other epidemics. In view of this, we contend that at this point in time there is insufficient evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We develop individual-based movement ecology models (MEM) to explore turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) migration decisions at both hourly and daily scales. Vulture movements in 10 migration events were recorded with satellite-reporting GPS sensors, and flight behavior was observed visually, aided by on-the-ground VHF radio-tracking. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset to obtain values for wind speed, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and cloud height and used a digital elevation model for a measure of terrain ruggedness. A turkey vulture fitted with a heart-rate logger during 124 h of flight during 38 contiguous days showed only a small increase in mean heart rate as distance traveled per day increased, which suggests that, unlike flapping, soaring flight does not lead to greatly increased metabolic costs. Data from 10 migrations for 724 hourly segments and 152 daily segments showed that vultures depended heavily upon high levels of TKE in the atmospheric boundary layer to increase flight distances and maintain preferred bearings at both hourly and daily scales. We suggest how the MEM can be extended to other spatial and temporal scales of avian migration. Our success in relating model-derived atmospheric variables to migration indicates the potential of using regional reanalysis data, as here, and potentially other regional, higher-resolution, atmospheric models in predicting changing movement patterns of soaring birds under various scenarios of climate and land use change.

Abstract = {The results of two text-change experiments are reported. The experiments were designed to investigate the syntactic representation of garden path sentences such as While the man hunted the deer that was brown and graceful ran into the woods, specifically the claim that a significant number of misinterpretations of such sentences are due to incomplete syntactic reanalysis (Christianson et al. Cogn Psychol 42:368–407, 2001). In the experiments reported here, the pronoun it was added (Expt. 1) or deleted (Expt. 2) from short texts containing such sentences. Participants were more or less likely to notice both deletions and additions of it in certain syntactic contexts, as predicted by the incomplete reanalysis account. Correlations with reading times support this interpretation of the results. Overall, the data are consistent with a "good enough" view of language processing (Ferreira et al.

Abstract = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers' efforts to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., & Rayner, K. (1982). Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology, 14, 178-210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision, that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment 2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained, partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing computational models of eye-movements in reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Pavlovian threat (fear) conditioning (PTC) is an experimental paradigm that couples innate aversive stimuli with neutral cues to elicit learned defensive behavior in response to the neutral cue. PTC is commonly used as a translational model to study neurobiological and behavioral aspects of fear and anxiety disorders including Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Though PTSD is a complex multi-faceted construct that cannot be fully captured in animals PTC is a conceptually valid model for studying the development and maintenance of learned threat responses. Thus, it can inform the understanding of PTSD symptomatology. However, there are significant individual differences in posttraumatic stress that are not as of yet accounted for in studies of PTC. Individuals exposed to danger have been shown to follow distinct patterns: some adapt rapidly and completely (resilience) others adapt slowly (recovery) and others failure to adapt (chronic stress response). Identifying similar behavioral outcomes in PTC increases the translatability of this model. In this report we present a flexible methodology for identifying individual differences in PTC by modeling latent subpopulations or classes characterized by defensive behavior during training. We provide evidence from a reanalysis of previously examined PTC learning and extinction data in rats to demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in identifying outcomes analogous to those observed in humans exposed to threat. By utilizing Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to test for heterogeneity in freezing behavior during threat conditioning and extinction learning in adult male outbred rats (n = 58) three outcomes were identified: rapid extinction (57.3%), slow extinction (32.3%), and failure to extinguish (10.3%) indicating that heterogeneity analogous to that in naturalistic human studies is present in experimental animal studies strengthening their translatability in understanding stress responses in humans.

Abstract = {Recognition memory judgments can be based on recollection of qualitative information about an earlier study event or on assessments of stimulus familiarity. Schizophrenia is associated with pronounced deficits in overall recognition memory, and these deficits are highly predictive of global functioning. However, the extent to which these deficits reflect impairments in recollection or familiarity is less well understood. In the current article, we reviewed studies that used remember-know-new, process dissociation, and receiver operating characteristic procedures to investigate recollection and familiarity in schizophrenia. We also performed a quantitative reanalysis of these study results to obtain recollection and familiarity estimates that account for methodological differences between studies. Contrary to previous conclusions that recollection is selectively impaired in schizophrenia, we found evidence for both familiarity and recollection deficits across studies, suggesting multi-focal medial temporal lobe and/or prefrontal cortex dysfunction. The familiarity deficits were more variable with frequent small-to-medium rather than medium-to-large effect sizes, suggesting that familiarity could be potentially used as a compensatory ability, whereas recollection is conceptualized as a therapeutic target for new treatment development.

Abstract = {The development of successful treatments for humans after traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries (TBI and SCI, respectively) requires animal research. This effort can be hampered when promising experimental results cannot be replicated because of incorrect data analysis procedures. To identify and hopefully avoid these errors in future studies, the articles in seven journals with the highest number of basic science central nervous system TBI and SCI animal research studies published in 2010 (N = 125 articles) were reviewed for their data analysis procedures. After identifying the most common statistical errors, the implications of those findings were demonstrated by reanalyzing previously published data from our laboratories using the identified inappropriate statistical procedures, then comparing the two sets of results. Overall, 70% of the articles contained at least one type of inappropriate statistical procedure. The highest percentage involved incorrect post hoc t-tests (56.4%), followed by inappropriate parametric statistics (analysis of variance and t-test; 37.6%). Repeated Measures analysis was inappropriately missing in 52.0% of all articles and, among those with behavioral assessments, 58% were analyzed incorrectly. Reanalysis of our published data using the most common inappropriate statistical procedures resulted in a 14.1% average increase in significant effects compared to the original results. Specifically, an increase of 15.5% occurred with Independent t-tests and 11.1% after incorrect post hoc t-tests. Utilizing proper statistical procedures can allow more-definitive conclusions, facilitate replicability of research results, and enable more accurate translation of those results to the clinic.

Abstract = {The functional electrophysiology of the human cerebellum remains poorly characterized. Existing knowledge originates primarily from lesion studies and increasingly from hemodynamic measures such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, along with some evidence in recent years from transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this context, we revisit the few existing records of intracranial recordings from the human cerebellum, and uncover additional little-known reports—three from the Soviet Union, published in Russian between 1949 and 1951, and one from Belgium, published in French in 1964. These studies together demonstrate electrical rhythms of the human cerebellar cortex at frequencies as high as 250 Hz, including task-related modulations. A reanalysis of their electrode traces with state-of-the-art spectral analysis techniques confirm the reported frequency bands, and showed that these modulations were sustained for 100–200 ms. These remarkable observations from the early ages of intracranial mapping of the human brain are in line with recent electrophysiological studies of oscillations in the rodent cerebellum as well as magnetoencephalographic findings in humans. Time–frequency analyses have provided valuable insight into the function of cerebral cortex, and may prove even more critical for the differing neurophysiology of the cerebellum. We contend that these insights will be invaluable to bridge the role of oscillatory networks in the cerebellum with those of cerebral cortex in mediating perception, action, and cognition and to investigate possible cerebellar involvement in neurological dysfunction.

Abstract = {This article evaluates the suitability of low frequency (LF) heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of sympathetic cardiac control and the LF/high frequency (HF) ratio as an index of autonomic balance. It includes a comprehensive literature review and a reanalysis of some previous studies on autonomic cardiovascular regulation. The following sources of evidence are addressed: effects of manipulations affecting sympathetic and vagal activity on HRV, predictions of group differences in cardiac autonomic regulation from HRV, relationships between HRV and other cardiac parameters, and the theoretical and mathematical bases of the concept of autonomic balance. Available data challenge the interpretation of the LF and LF/HF ratio as indices of sympathetic cardiac control and autonomic balance, respectively, and suggest that the HRV power spectrum, including its LF component, is mainly determined by the parasympathetic system.

Abstract = {Objective: No studies have found a positive effect of anxiety treatment on physical functioning, but recent investigations of the 12-item Short Form Health Questionnaire (SF-12), which is frequently used to assess physical functioning, have suggested that orthogonal scoring of the summary measure may distort representations of physical health. The current study reanalyzes whether anxiety treatment improves physical functioning using oblique scoring in the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) randomized clinical trial for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Replication was tested in reanalysis of data from the earlier Collaborative Care for Anxiety and Panic (CCAP) randomized clinical trial for the treatment of panic disorder. Method: The CALM study included 1004 primary care patients with panic, social anxiety, generalized anxiety or posttraumatic stress disorders. Patients received usual care (UC) or an evidence-based intervention (cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotropic medication or both; ITV). Physical functioning (SF-12v2) was assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months. Oblique and orthogonal scoring methods for the physical functioning aggregate measure from SF-12 scale items were compared. Results: In CALM, physical functioning improved to a greater degree in ITV than UC for oblique but not orthogonal scoring. Findings were replicated in the CCAP data. Conclusions: Evidence-based treatment for anxiety disorders in primary care improves physical functioning when measured using oblique scoring of the SF-12. Due to this scoring issue, effects of mental health treatment on physical functioning may have been understated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {According to several studies auditory discrimination as measured by mismatch negativity (MMN) is compromised in participants with reading disorder. However, studies on duration discrimination have produced conflicting findings [Baldeweg, T., Richardson, A., Watkins, S., Foale, C., & Gruzelier, J., 1999. Impaired auditory frequency discrimination in dyslexia detected with mismatch evoked potentials. Annals of Neurology, 4, 1-9; Corbera, S., Escera, C., & Artigas, J., 2006. Impaired duration mismatch negativity in developmental dyslexia. Neuroreport, 17, 1051-1055]. Auditory sensitivity has not been as actively investigated among children with attention deficit, although attention problems often co-occur with dyslexia. The present study is a reanalysis of MMN data gathered from control children and children with reading disorder (RD) and/or attention deficit (AD). In our previous analysis [Huttunen, T., Halonen, A., Kaartinen, J. & Lyytinen, H., 2007. Does mismatch negativity show differences in reading disabled children as compared to normal children and children with attention deficit? Developmental Neuropsychology, 31, 453-470.], the only significant difference between the groups was in the lateralization of the MMNs in the RD and the control group: the MMNs of the RD group were more pronounced over the left hemisphere, while those of the control group appeared larger over the right hemisphere. A reanalysis was conducted to study whether the group definition criteria and/or overlap of the attention and reading deficits in the AD group might have affected the results. For this purpose participants were divided to four groups: control children, children with RD, children with AD, and children with both RD and AD. MMN was elicited by duration deviations in a continuous sound. Significant differences were observed in the MMN peaks between the control group and all clinical groups: the MMNs were diminished in the right hemisphere in the RD group, in all frontal and central channels in the RD+AD group, and the MMN peaks appeared earlier in frontal channels in the AD group.

Abstract = {This paper examines the hypothesis that grammatical function reanalyses in simple sentences should not be treated as phrase structure revisions, but rather as increased costs in "linking" an argument from a syntactic to a semantic representation. To this end, we investigated whether subject-object reanalyses in German verb-final sentences can be associated with an electrophysiological processing signature that is distinct from the response typically engendered by structure-affecting reanalyses (the P600). We hypothesized that the previously observed heterogeneous ERP component pattern for subject-object reanalyses in German might be due to task- or strategy-related interactions between the critical processing mechanisms and the experimental environment. In order to minimize specific task influences, Experiment 1 therefore embedded subject-object ambiguities into short stories (presented auditorily). Constructions with dative and accusative objects both showed a biphasic N400-late positivity pattern for disambiguation towards an object-initial structure. These results thus contrast with previous findings, in showing that there is no principled difference in the component pattern for the two types of structures. This conclusion was confirmed by the results of Experiment 2, which presented the identical accusative sentences from Experiment 1 in isolation using two different tasks (comprehension vs. acceptability) and again revealed N400-late positivity responses. From the overall data pattern, we conclude that the N400 is a robust correlate of grammatical function reanalysis that occurs independently of any lexical factors and, consequently, that grammatical function reanalysis is functionally distinct from phrase structure reanalysis.

Abstract = {While syntactic reanalysis has been extensively investigated in psycholinguistics, comparatively little is known about reanalysis in the semantic domain. We used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to keep track of semantic processes involved in understanding short narratives such as 'The girl was writing a letter when her friend spilled coffee on the paper'. We hypothesize that these sentences are interpreted in two steps: (1) when the progressive clause is processed, a discourse model is computed in which the goal state (a complete letter) is predicted to hold; (2) when the subordinate clause is processed, the initial representation is recomputed to the effect that, in the final discourse structure, the goal state is not satisfied. Critical sentences evoked larger sustained anterior negativities (SANs) compared to controls, starting around 400 ms following the onset of the sentence-final word, and lasting for about 400 ms. The amplitude of the SAN was correlated with the frequency with which participants, in an offline probe-selection task, responded that the goal state was not attained. Our results raise the possibility that the brain supports some form of non-monotonic recomputation to integrate information which invalidates previously held assumptions.

Abstract = {Background: An important question in the design of experiments is how to ensure that the findings from the experiment are generalizable to a larger population. This concern with generalizability is particularly important when treatment effects are heterogeneous and when selecting units into the experiment using random sampling is not possible—two conditions commonly met in large-scale educational experiments. Method: This article introduces a model-based balanced-sampling framework for improving generalizations, with a focus on developing methods that are robust to model misspecification. Additionally, the article provides a new method for sample selection within this framework: First units in an inference population are divided into relatively homogenous strata using cluster analysis, and then the sample is selected using distance rankings. Result: In order to demonstrate and evaluate the method, a reanalysis of a completed experiment is conducted. This example compares samples selected using the new method with the actual sample used in the experiment. Results indicate that even under high nonresponse, balance is better on most covariates and that fewer coverage errors result. Conclusion: The article concludes with a discussion of additional benefits and limitations of the method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Use of weapons is a risk factor for domestic violence severity, especially lethality. It is not clear, however, whether access to firearms itself increases assault severity, or whether it is characteristic of a subgroup of offenders who are more likely to commit severe and repeated domestic assault. This reanalysis of 1,421 police reports of domestic violence by men found that 6% used a weapon during the assault and 8% had access to firearms. We expected that firearm use would be rare compared to other weapons and that actual weapon use rather than firearm access would increase the severity of domestic assaults. Firearm access was associated with assault severity, but this was mostly attributable to use of nonfirearm weapons. Weapon use was associated with older age, lower education, and relationship history as well as to assault severity. Victims were most concerned about future assaults following threats and actual injuries. Although firearm access and weapon use were related to actuarial risk of domestic violence recidivism, neither predicted the occurrence or severity of recidivism. We conclude that, consistent with previous research in the United States and Canada, firearm use in domestic violence is uncommon even among offenders with known firearm access. Weapon use is characteristic of a subgroup of offenders who commit more severe domestic violence, and seizure of weapons may be an effective intervention.

Abstract = {Eye-movement control during reading depends on foveal and parafoveal information. If the parafoveal preview of the next word is suppressed, reading is less efficient. A linear mixed model (LMM) reanalysis of McDonald (2006) confirmed his observation that preview benefit may be limited to parafoveal words that have been selected as the saccade target. Going beyond the original analyses, in the same LMM, we examined how the preview effect (i.e., the difference in single-fixation duration, SFD, between random-letter and identical preview) depends on the gaze duration on the pretarget word and on the amplitude of the saccade moving the eye onto the target word. There were two key results: (a) The shorter the saccade amplitude (i.e., the larger preview space), the shorter a subsequent SFD with an identical preview; this association was not observed with a random-letter preview. (b) However, the longer the gaze duration on the pretarget word, the longer the subsequent SFD on the target, with the difference between random-letter string and identical previews increasing with preview time. A third pattern—increasing cost of a random-letter string in the parafovea associated with shorter saccade amplitudes—was observed for target gaze durations. Thus, LMMs revealed that preview effects, which are typically summarized under “preview benefit”, are a complex mixture of preview cost and preview benefit and vary with preview space and preview time. The consequence for reading is that parafoveal preview may not only facilitate, but also interfere with lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Although effective in treating an array of neurological disorders, antipsychotics are associated with deleterious metabolic side effects. Through high-throughput screening, we previously identified phenothiazine antipsychotics as modulators of the human insulin promoter. Here, we extended our initial finding to structurally diverse typical and atypical antipsychotics. We then identified the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway as being involved in the effect of antipsychotics on the insulin promoter, finding that antipsychotics activated SMAD3, a downstream effector of the TGFβ pathway, through a receptor distinct from the TGFβ receptor family and known neurotransmitter receptor targets of antipsychotics. Of note, antipsychotics that do not cause metabolic side effects did not activate SMAD3. In vivo relevance was demonstrated by reanalysis of gene expression data from human brains treated with antipsychotics, which showed altered expression of SMAD3 responsive genes. This work raises the possibility that antipsychotics could be designed that retain beneficial CNS activity while lacking deleterious metabolic side effects.

Abstract = {Researchers are strongly encouraged to accompany the results of statistical tests with appropriate estimates of effect size. For 2-group comparisons, a probability-based effect size estimator (A) has many appealing properties (e.g., it is easy to understand, robust to violations of parametric assumptions, insensitive to outliers). We review generalizations of the A statistic to extend its use to applications with discrete data, with weighted data, with k > 2 groups, and with correlated samples. These generalizations are illustrated through reanalyses of data from published studies on sex differences in the acceptance of hypothetical offers of casual sex and in scores on a measure of economic enlightenment, on age differences in reported levels of Authentic Pride, and in differences between the numbers of promises made and kept in romantic relationships. Drawing from research on the construction of confidence intervals for the A statistic, we recommend a bootstrap method that can be used for each generalization of A. We provide a suite of programs that should make it easy to use the A statistic and accompany it with a confidence interval in a wide variety of research contexts.

Abstract = {Even as modern research on mindfulness has expanded, debate continues with regard to the measurement and conceptualization of mindfulness. This divergence has manifested in a proliferation of different measurement approaches. The present research contributes to the advancement of mindfulness measurement by performing a Rasch model analysis of the psychometric properties of the short form of the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI-14). This rigorous psychometric method belongs to the family item response theory and can be considered to be a set of approaches complementing classical test theory. The FMI- 14 was administered to a nonclinical convenience sample of N = 1,452 German adults. Our data showed poor fit to the Rasch model. A reanalysis of the model excluding one particular misfitting item (number 13) yielded an acceptable fit for the originally proposed one-factorial solution to the Rasch model. However, a two-factorial solution with the subfacets “presence” and “acceptance” provided a better overall fit than the unidimensional solution. Some degree of differential item functioning could be observed both in the uni- and two-dimensional solution suggesting that potential exists for improving the measurement quality of the FMI-13. In line with the recent research, it is concluded that the FMI-13 should be considered as a two-dimensional rather than a unidimensional instrument.

Abstract = {Blending theory proposes that metaphor involves mappings between elements in two distinct domains and integration of information from these two domains. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have suggested that literal mapping occurs during metaphor comprehension. However, it has remained unclear whether accessing literal meanings affects metaphor comprehension and the contextual factors affecting blending remain poorly understood. The present study used a two stimulus word-to-sentence matching paradigm to study the effects of literal mapping and semantic congruity on metaphor comprehension using probe words from different domains. ERPs were recorded when 18 participants read short novel metaphors (e.g., The girl is a lemon) or literal control sentences (e.g., The fruit is a lemon) preceded by either a relevant or irrelevant word. Five conditions were measured: congruent target metaphor, congruent source metaphor, congruent literal, incongruent metaphor, and incongruent literal conditions. The analysis of the late positive components (LPC) revealed a significant difference in the P600 amplitudes between incongruent and congruent conditions. We also demonstrated that mapping across remote domains evoked larger P600 amplitudes than mapping across close domains or performing no mapping. The results suggest that the demands of conceptual reanalysis are associated with conceptual mapping and incongruity in both literal and metaphorical language, which supports the position of blending theory that there is a shared mechanism for both metaphoric and literal language comprehension. Amplitude differences suggest that integration difficulty is modulated by mapping degree rather than the timing of lexical access in the present study. Our results do not provide evidence that directly supports earlier models that propose literal meanings are accessed before or in parallel with metaphoric meanings.

Abstract = {This study investigates the reanalysis processes as a consequence of conflict between incompatible sentential representations in sentence comprehension. Using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, we examined the situation in which the sentential representation built upon world knowledge (i.e., the plausibility heuristic) conflicts with the one built upon syntactic rules (i.e., the syntactic analysis). We found that sentence processing is constrained both by the complexity of syntactic structure and by the reader's cognitive control ability. For readers with higher control abilities, as measured by the Stroop task, a sustained positivity was observed between 350 and 850 ms when conflicts occurred in complex (i.e., passive) sentences, whereas an anterior negativity was observed between 300 and 600 ms when conflicts occurred in simple (i.e., active) sentences. For readers with lower control abilities, however, brain potentials were not affected by the complexity of syntactic structure, with a sustained positivity obtained between 350 and 750 ms for conflicts occurring in both active and passive sentences. These results suggest that the mechanisms of cognitive control are involved in the reanalysis processes to resolve conflict between incompatible sentential representations. The sustained positivity is possibly associated with detection and resolution of representational conflict, while the anterior negativity is associated with suppression of inappropriate representation or response tendency.

Abstract = {This paper examines the relevance of the constraints of working memory to Japanese syntactic reanalyses. A phrase-by-phrase, self-paced reading experiment was performed with two kinds of sentences which were assumed to involve reanalyses as experimental sentences. The comprehension accuracy and the reading time were analyzed in relation to the constraints of working memory estimated by the Japanese Reading Span Test. Our results indicated that a reader with a high score in the test, comprehended the sentences with costly reanalyses more accurately, and spent a longer time than a reader with a low score. This suggests that the efficiency generally assumed for readers with high (Japanese) Reading Span Scores does not necessarily imply rapidity in reanalyses. Some implications of our results for models of working memory, and the significance of the limitations of working memory, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The two methodological points that DeVylder identified were not recognized by them or the authors. With respect to the underweighting of the overall sample, it is difficult to determine to what extent it would have changed the results if the sample had been properly weighted. With respect to the second comment, DeVylder correctly notes that it was mistakenly assumed that persons who were missing the 12-month data should be coded as having no psychotic experiences. He presented revised data that correspond to the reanalysis in which missing persons are excluded rather than coded as zero. An additional variable—living in the South versus the West—was found to be significantly associated with reduced rates of psychotic experiences. DeVylder has identified some other differences between the 12-month and lifetime items. Thus the reader should use appropriate caution in interpreting the 12-month findings.

Abstract = {Reports the retraction of "Childhood maltreatment and methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 in bipolar disorder" by Nader Perroud, Alexandre Dayer, Camille Piguet, Audrey Nallet, Sophie Favre, Alain Malafosse and Jean-Michel Aubry (The British Journal of Psychiatry, 2014[Jan][1], Vol 204[1], 30-35). An investigation carried out at the request of the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva has concluded that one of the authors (Alain Malafosse) fabricated methylation data. A reanalysis of the DNA reveals no significant correlation between childhood trauma and methylation of the NR3C1 gene. The original conclusions therefore no longer hold true and we wish to retract the paper. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-02061-008[/rid]). Background: Early-life adversities represent risk factors for the development of bipolar affective disorder and are associated with higher severity of the disorder. This may be the consequence of a sustained alteration of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis resulting from epigenetic modifications of the gene coding for the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). Aims: To investigate whether severity of childhood maltreatment is associated with increased methylation of the exon 1F NR3C1 promoter in bipolar disorder. Method: A sample of people with bipolar disorder (n = 99) were assessed for childhood traumatic experiences. The percentage of NR3C1 methylation was measured for each participant. Results: The higher the number of trauma events, the higher was the percentage of NR3C1 methylation (β = 0.52, 95% CI 0.46–0.59, P << 0.0001). The severity of each type of maltreatment (sexual, physical and emotional) was also associated with NR3C1 methylation status. Conclusions: Early-life adversities have a sustained effect on the HPA axis through epigenetic processes and this effect may be measured in peripheral blood. This enduring biological impact of early trauma may alter the development of the brain and lead to adult psychopathological disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In the Swedish educational system, teachers have the dual responsibility of assigning final grades and marking their own students’ national tests. The Government has mandated the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to remark samples of the national tests to see if teacher marking can be trusted. Reports from this project have concluded that intermarker consistency is low and that teachers’ markings are generous as compared to those of the external markers. These findings have been heavily publicized, leading to distrust in teachers’ assessments. In the article, we analyze and discuss the remarking studies from methodological as well as substantive angles. We conclude that the design applied in the reanalysis does not allow inferences about bias in marking across schools or teachers. We also conclude that there are several alternative explanations for the observation that teacher marks are higher than the external marks: The external markers did not form a representative sample, they read copies with sometimes marginal legibility, and they used a different scale for marking than the teachers had used. The results are thus not as clearcut as suggested by the reports and media releases, which is because a school inspections logic rather than a research logic was applied in designing, conducting, and reporting the studies.

Abstract = {We contend that clusters of cases co-constitute statistical interactions among variables. Interactions among variables imply clusters of cases within which statistical effects differ. Regression coefficients may be productively viewed as sums across clusters of cases, and in this sense regression coefficients may be said to be "composed" of clusters of cases. We explicate a four-step procedure that discovers interaction effects based on clusters of cases in the data matrix, hence aiding in inductive model specification. We illustrate with two examples. One is a reanalysis of data from a published study of the effect of social welfare policy extensiveness on poverty rates across 15 countries. The second uses General Social Survey data to predict four different dimensions of ego-network homophily. We find support for our contention that clusters of the rows of a data matrix may be exploited to discover statistical interactions among variables that improve model fit.

Abstract = {Neuroimaging methods with enhanced spatial resolution such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) suggest that the subcortical striatum plays a critical role in human reward processing. Analysis of FMRI data requires several preprocessing steps, some of which entail tradeoffs. For instance, while spatial smoothing can enhance statistical power, it may also bias localization towards regions that contain more gray than white matter. In a meta-analysis and reanalysis of an existing dataset, we sought to determine whether spatial smoothing could systematically bias the spatial localization of foci related to reward anticipation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). An activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis revealed that peak ventral striatal ALE foci for studies that used smaller spatial smoothing kernels (i.e. b6 mm FWHM) were more anterior than those identified for studies that used larger kernels (i.e. >7 mm FWHM). Additionally, subtraction analysis of findings for studies that used smaller versus larger smoothing kernels revealed a significant cluster of differential activity in the left relatively anterior NAcc (Talairach coordinates: −10, 9, −1). A second meta-analysis revealed that larger smoothing kernels were correlated with more posterior localizations of NAcc activation foci (p < 0.015), but revealed no significant associations with other potentially relevant parameters (including voxel volume, magnet strength, and publication date). Finally, repeated analysis of a representative dataset processed at different smoothing kernels (i.e., 0–12 mm) also indicated that smoothing systematically yielded more posterior activation foci in the NAcc (p < 0.005). Taken together, these findings indicate that spatial smoothing can systematically bias the spatial localization of striatal activity. These findings have implications both for historical interpretation of past findings related to reward processing and for the analysis of future studies.

Abstract = {Students’ engagement and performance in their first year of high school offer strong signals about their prospects for earning a diploma 4 years later. These performance measures can be used to construct on-track indicators to measure a school’s performance and to identify needs of specific students who are at risk of dropping out. This article undertakes a systematic reanalysis of several on-track indicators that predicted the likelihood of graduating with a New York State Regents diploma in New York City. The analytic dataset contains comprehensive longitudinal information for first-time 9th graders who are enrolled in high school between 2001–2002 and 2010–2011. The results show that the current New York City Department of Education indicator (earning 10 or more course credits in the 9th grade) offers a reliable prediction of graduation with a Regents diploma. However, an indicator based on earning 10 or more credits and passing at least one Regents exam represents a substantial improvement on the current indicator and was used as the primary indicator for additional analyses. These analyses showed that this on-track indicator has been reliable and stable across seven cohorts of entering 9th graders. The analysis also shows that the substantial increase in 9th-grade on-track rates offers a reliable foreshadowing of increases in Regents diploma graduation rates in New York City. Additionally, the on-track indicator was highly predictive for a wide range of student subgroups and helps to highlight the prominent gaps in performance along racial, gender, and economic lines. Finally, the article highlights significant variation in on-track rates across schools, that should be investigated in future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

A Norwegian mental health research organization, however, recognizes the importance of involving service users as coresearchers, and it has initiated a training program in research design and methodology intended to empower them as active participants in research projects. In this study, we use qualitative methods to explore how coresearchers with mental health service user background experience their participation as coresearchers and how they experienced attending an academic training program in research methodology. We invited 12 coresearchers with service user background to be participants in the study. We used focus groups as our data collection method, transcribed the group discussions verbatim, and analyzed the transcriptions using qualitative methodology. We then took the preliminary analyses back to the participants for discussion, auditing, and reanalysis. We identified three core themes that represent important coresearcher functions around which the participants developed a consensual understanding: the advocate for usefulness, the brakeman, and the interpreter. There is increasing political will to involve service users in research. Our findings explore how the service user coresearchers experience their potential functions and quality enhancing contributions after having taken part both in a research training course and actual research projects.

Abstract = {Objective: Fluke et al. (2010) analyzed Canadian Incidence Study on Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS) data collected in 1998 to explore the influence of clinical and organizational characteristics on the decision to place Aboriginal children in an out-of-home placement at the conclusion of a child maltreatment investigation. This study explores this same question using CIS data collected in 2003 which included a larger sample of Aboriginal children and First Nations child and family service agencies. Methods: The decision to place a child in an out-of-home placement was examined using data from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect-2003 and a reanalysis of CIS-1998 data (Fluke et al., 2010). The CIS-2003 dataset includes information on nearly 12,000 child maltreatment investigations from the time of report to case disposition. The CIS-2003 also captures information on the characteristics of investigating workers and the child welfare organizations for which they work. Multi-level statistical models were developed to analyze the influence of clinical and organizational variables using MPlus software. MPlus allows the use of dichotomous outcome variables, which are more reflective of decision-making in child welfare and facilitates the specific case of the logistic link function for binary outcome variables under maximum likelihood estimation. Results: Final models revealed the proportion of investigations conducted by the child welfare agency involving Aboriginal children was a key single agency level predictor of the placement decision. Specifically, the higher the proportion of investigations of Aboriginal children, the more likely placement was to occur. Contrary to the findings in the first paper (Fluke et al., 2010), individual Aboriginal status also remained significant in the final model at the first level. Conclusions: Further analysis needs to be conducted to further understand individual and organizational level variables that may influence decisions regarding placement of Aboriginal children. There is also a need for research that is sensitive to differences among, and between, Métis, First Nations and Inuit communities. Results are not generalizable to Québec because data from this province were excluded. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Examine whether long- and short-term sunlight radiation is related to stroke incidence. Methods: Fifteen-year residential histories merged with satellite, ground monitor, and model reanalysis data were used to determine sunlight radiation (insolation) and temperature exposure for a cohort of 16,606 stroke and coronary artery disease-free black and white participants aged ≥ 45 years from the 48 contiguous United States. Fifteen-, 10-, 5-, 2-, and 1-year exposures were used to predict stroke incidence during follow-up in Cox proportional hazard models. Potential confounders and mediators were included during model building. Results: Shorter exposure periods exhibited similar, but slightly stronger relationships than longer exposure periods. After adjustment for other covariates, the previous year’s monthly average insolation exposure below the median gave a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.61 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–2.26), and the previous year’s highest compared to the second highest quartile of monthly average maximum temperature exposure gave an HR of 1.92 (95%, 1.27–2.92). Interpretation: These results indicate a relationship between lower levels of sunlight radiation and higher stroke incidence. The biological pathway of this relationship is not clear. Future research will show whether this finding stands, the pathway for this relationship, and whether it is due to short- or long-term exposures.

Abstract = {Although there is abundant evidence for female superiority in Face Cognition (FC), a number of questions regarding sex differences remain to be addressed. Here we report a reanalysis of data on the level of latent factors, modeled on the basis of an extensive test battery applied to three samples of over 800 adults in all. In independent samples the measurement structure of FC was invariant for both sexes, indicating that the measurement of the construct does not depend on the context variable sex, and investigating mean performance differences will not be biased by measurement issues—a neglected aspect in previous studies. We confirmed female superiority for face perception (FP) and face memory (FM). For the first time we could show that these sex differences prevailed after accounting for sex differences in broadly measured general cognitive functioning and in object perception. Across adult age, sex differences in FM increased due to the rapid decline of this ability in men, whereas performance in women remained stable across adult age. Self-reported social involvement and things-oriented activities moderated sex-differences in FM. Results show that sex differences are salient at the level of specific FC constructs and that they can be partially explained by social involvement.

Abstract = {Objective: To systematically evaluate the latent structure of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) through reanalysis of previous studies and meta confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Method: Data from 28 samples were obtained from published studies concerning the latent structure of the HADS. Ten models were considered, including eight previously identified models and two bifactor models. The fit of each model was assessed separately in each sample and by meta CFA. Meta CFA was conducted using all samples and using subgroups consisting of community samples, cardiovascular disease samples and samples from studies administering the English language version of the HADS. Results: A bifactor model including all items loading onto a general distress factor and two orthogonal anxiety and depression group factors provided the best fit for the majority of samples. Meta CFA provided further support for the bifactor model with two group factors. This was the case using all samples, as well as all subgroup analyses. The general distress factor explained 73% of the covariance between items,with the (autonomic) anxiety and (anhedonic) depression factors explaining 11% and 16%, respectively. Conclusion: A bifactor structure provides the most acceptable empirical explanation for the HADS correlation structure. Due to the presence of a strong general factor, the HADS does not provide good separation between symptoms of anxiety and depression. We recommend it is best used as a measure of general distress.

Abstract = {ERPs are commonly elicited by semantic and syntactic violations in sentences, leading to proposals that they reflect neural activity underlying ordinary language comprehension. We examined ERPs in an auditory sentence-picture-matching task, using nonanomalous sentences that were either semantically reversible, (boy pushes girl) or irreversible, (boy eats apple). Time locked to the end of the critical clause, which occurred in the middle of a longer sentence, we observed an enhanced central-posterior positivity in response to the reversible sentences. The topography of this response is consistent with the P600 potential reported in studies of syntactic anomalies and other manipulations related to sentence structure. Following the end of the sentence, during a memory delay period prior to picture onset, reversible sentences also evoked a protracted anterior negativity, predominantly on the left. This negativity was stronger for sentences containing relative clauses compared to simple active sentences, but did not differ between object-embedded and the less complex subject-embedded clauses. The observation of a P600 occurring selectively in reversible sentences supports the interpretation of that potential as reflecting the syntactic processing of thematic relationships, as irreversible sentences contained alternative cues for thematic roles. The left anterior negativity likely reflects later processes of rehearsal and reanalysis of sentence content in working memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Recent work has shown that α₁-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs extinction in fear conditioning paradigms in rodents. However, studies of the role of α₁-adrenergic receptors in extinction using other conditioning paradigms, such as those examining the conditioned effects of drug of abuse, have yielded inconsistent results. In this article, we reanalyze and extend previously reported findings of the effect of prazosin, an α₁-adrenergic receptor antagonist, on the extinction of a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference in rats, using a median split of performance during the initial test for preference. This new reanalysis, which includes further extinction testing, indicated a paradoxical dose effect. A single post-test administration of a lower dose of prazosin, 0.3 mg/kg intraperitoneally, impaired extinction in rats that showed a below-median preference during initial testing, but had no effect on extinction in rats that showed an above-median preference during initial testing. In contrast, a single post-test administration of a higher dose of prazosin, 1.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally, enhanced extinction in rats that showed an above-median preference during initial testing, but had no effect on extinction in rats that showed a below-median preference during initial testing. Consistent with other studies of fear and drug conditioning, these results suggest the involvement of the α₁-adrenergic receptor in the formation of extinction memories, but also indicate a potentially important differential effect on extinction on the basis of the dose of prazosin and the strength of the initial learning.

Abstract = {We establish that two-part models of pointing performance (Welford's model) describe pointing on a computer display significantly better than traditional one-part models (Fitts's Law). We explore the space of pointing models and describe how independent contributions of movement amplitude and target width to pointing time can be captured in a parameter k. Through a reanalysis of data from related work we demonstrate that one-part formulations are fragile in describing pointing performance, and that this fragility is present for various devices and techniques. We show that this same data can be significantly better described using two-part models. Finally, we demonstrate through further analysis of previous work and new experimental data that k increases linearly with gain. Our primary contribution is the demonstration that Fitts's Law is more limited in applicability than previously appreciated, and that more robust models, such as Welford's formulation, should be adopted in many cases of practical interest.

Abstract = {Arriving late for scheduled contraceptive reinjections is common in many countries and contributes to discontinuation when providers are unsure how to manage such clients. A clinic‐randomized cohort and cross‐sectional study with more than 5,000 clients using injectable contraceptives was conducted in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa to test the effectiveness of a provider job aid for managing late‐returning clients and promoting continued use of the method. A marginally significant difference in reinjection rates between intervention and control groups was found for those up to two weeks late, and reanalysis excluding one clinic that experienced stockout issues revealed a significant difference. The difference in reinjection rates for those 2–12 weeks late was also found to be significant. The one‐reinjection cycle continuation rate for the intervention group was higher than that for the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Appropriate management of late‐returning clients is critical, and this study illustrates that reinjection rates can be significantly increased with a low‐resource provider job aid.

Abstract = {In probabilistic inferences concerning which of two objects has the larger criterion value (e.g., which of two cities has more inhabitants), participants may recognize both objects, only one, or neither. According to the mental-toolbox approach, different decision strategies exist for each of these cases, utilizing different probabilistic cues. Possibly, however, participants use these cues to build a subjective rank order that involves all objects, irrespective of their recognition status. The decision process then simply utilizes the distance between two objects in one’s subjective order. We tested the role of such linear orders in reanalyses of existing data and in a new experiment. Participants’ choices and decision times were determined both by subjective rank-order distances and by the recognition status of the compared objects. To integrate these theoretically inconsistent findings, we discuss the role of the evidential difference (or the degree of conflict) between two objects.

Abstract = {Impaired renal sodium excretion causes sodium retention, which prevents the nocturnal dip in blood pressure (BP); thus, high BP persists until excess sodium is excreted. The authors defined "dipping time" (DT) as the duration until the nocturnal BP falls below 90% of the daytime average. Diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are able to eliminate sodium retention and restore the non-dipper BP rhythm. Reanalysis of two previous studies demonstrate that HCTZ and ARB shortened the DT. Shortening DT correlated directly with the increase in daytime urinary sodium excretion (Study 2). DT can be used as a preliminary indicator of sodium retention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Depressive symptomatology is an important target of treatment in first episode schizophrenia. This reanalysis of the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST) describes the depressive symptomatology and the effect of antipsychotic treatment in patients suffering from first episode schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder randomized to treatment with low dose haloperidol (n = 103), amisulpride (n = 104), olanzapine (n = 105), quetiapine (n = 104) or ziprasidone (n = 82) for one year. At baseline, the mean score on the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) was 5.1 (±4.9) with 38.3% of patients having a CDSS score ≥6, i.e. clinically relevant depressive symptom severity. During treatment depression scores decreased, the mean CDSS score being 1.1 (±2.1) and 3.0% of patients having a CDSS≥6 at 52 weeks. The proportion of patients using antidepressants during the complete trial was 18.5% in the haloperidol group, 28.6% in the olanzapine group compared to 5.8% in the quetiapine group, 12.5% in the amisulpride group, and 9.8% in the ziprasidone group. There were no differences over time in the probability of being depressed (CDSS≥6) between the 5 treatment groups after adjustment for antidepressant use, nor in a sub analysis of patients who did not take any antidepressant. Depression scores at baseline or during the trial had no effect on treatment discontinuation or on the reduction of positive symptoms. In summary, the results of EUFEST did not demonstrate a differential effect of the antipsychotics studied on depressive symptomatology in patients with first episode schizophrenia.

Abstract = {In 1995 when we began our investigations of the human visual system using fMRI, little was known about the temporal properties of the fMRI signal. Before we felt comfortable making quantitative estimates of neuronal responses with this new technique, we decided to first conduct a basic study of how the time-course of the fMRI response varied with stimulus timing and strength. The results ended up showing strong evidence that to a first approximation the hemodynamic transformation was linear in time. This was both important and remarkable: important because nearly all fMRI data analysis techniques assume or require linearity, and remarkable because the physiological basis of the hemodynamic transformation is so complex that we still have a far from complete understanding of it. In this paper, we provide highlights of the results of our original paper supporting the linear transform hypothesis. A reanalysis of the original data provides some interesting new insights into the published results. We also provide a detailed appendix describing of the properties and predictions of a linear system in time in the context of the transformation between neuronal responses and the BOLD signal.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 143(2) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: General (see record [rid]2014-11241-002[/rid]). The article contained a data analysis error, stemming from incorrect data files for three participants being read into the analysis routine. All of the theoretical inferences based on the outcomes of statistical tests reported in the article are unchanged in light of the reanalysis. Although the significant reduction in fit that led the authors to opt for the two-factor structural equation model is now marginally significant, the two-factor interpretation of the data more cleanly characterizes two conceptually distinct constructs and thus is still the preferred model. The text corrections and two corrected figures are provided.] The concept of attention is central to theorizing in learning as well as in working memory. However, research to date has yet to establish how attention as construed in one domain maps onto the other. We investigate two manifestations of attention in category- and cue-learning to examine whether they might provide common ground between learning and working memory. Experiment 1 examined blocking and highlighting effects in an associative learning paradigm, which are widely thought to be attentionally mediated. No relationship between attentional performance indicators and working memory capacity (WMC) was observed, despite the fact that WMC was strongly associated with overall learning performance. Experiment 2 used a knowledge restructuring paradigm, which is known to require recoordination of partial category knowledge using representational attention. We found that the extent to which people successfully recoordinated their knowledge was related to WMC. The results illustrate a link between WMC and representational—but not dimensional—attention in category learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Traditional approaches within the framework of signal detection theory (SDT; Green & Swets, 1966), especially in the field of recognition memory, assume that the positioning of response criteria is not a noisy process. Recent work (Benjamin, Diaz, & Wee, 2009; Mueller & Weidemann, 2008) has challenged this assumption, arguing not only for the existence of criterion noise but also for its large magnitude and substantive contribution to individuals' performance. A review of these recent approaches for the measurement of criterion noise in SDT identifies several shortcomings and confoundings. A reanalysis of Benjamin et al.'s (2009) data sets as well as the results from a new experimental method indicate that the different forms of criterion noise proposed in the recognition memory literature are of very low magnitudes, and they do not provide a significant improvement over the account already given by traditional SDT without criterion noise.

Abstract = {P600 effects have been observed after syntactic ambiguous sentences, after several types of syntactic and semantic anomalies and after orthographic anomalies. On the basis of these findings, several investigators propose the P600 effect to reflect syntactic repair or syntactic restructuring. According to our Monitoring Theory the P600 effect reflects more general sentence reanalysis, to check whether the input sentence has been perceived appropriately. When the brain encounters a highly unexpected linguistic event, a conflict arises between the expected representation and the representation derived from the input. This conflict is proposed to trigger a process of reanalysis. In the present study, expectancy was manipulated by varying the truth-value of a sentence in relation to a picture. ERPs were recorded from 27 electrodes while we presented participants (N = 30) pictures of spatial arrays followed by a sentence giving a correct or incorrect description of the picture. The mismatches were predicted to create a conflict between the conceptual representation on the basis of the picture and the actual sentence and should therefore lead to a P600. A P600 effect was indeed observed after both intra-dimensional  Δ --'the triangle stands in front of the square.', and extra-dimensional  Δ --'the triangle stands below the square.' mismatches.

Abstract = {Understanding a complex sentence requires the processing of information at different (e.g., phonological, semantic, and syntactic) levels, the intermediate storage of this information and the unification of this information to compute the meaning of the sentence information. The present investigation homed in on two aspects of sentence processing: working memory and reanalysis. Event-related functional MRI was used in 12 healthy native speakers of German, while they read sentences. Half of the sentences had unambiguous initial noun-phrases (masculine nominative, masculine accusative) and thus signaled subject-first (canonical) or object-first (noncanonical) sentences. Noncanonical unambiguous sentences were supposed to entail greater demand on working memory, because of their more complex syntactic structure. The other half of the sentences had case-ambiguous initial noun-phrases (feminine gender). Only the second unambiguous noun-phrase (eighth position in the sentences) revealed, whether a canonical or noncanonical word order was present. Based on previous data it was hypothesized that ambiguous noncanonical sentences required a recomputation of the sentence, as subjects would initially commit to a subject first reading. In the respective contrasts two main areas of brain activation were observed. Unambiguous noncanonical sentences elicited more activation in left inferior frontal cortex relative unambiguous canonical sentences. This was interpreted in conjunction with the greater demands on working memory in the former condition. For noncanonical ambiguous relative to canonical ambiguous sentences, an activation of the left supramarginal gyrus was revealed, which was interpreted as a reflection of the reanalysis-requirements induced by this condition.

Abstract = {A psychoanalyst faces the extraordinary demand of becoming instrumental in the psychoanalytic process. In the candidate's attempt to rise to that expectation, the first step is the training analysis. As the centerpiece of psychoanalytic education, it is no ordinary analysis and bears special burdens intrinsic to its multiple functions and institutionalization. Recognizing the difficulties of both analytic education and analytic practice, Freud suggested that the analyst be periodically reanalyzed; for many, reanalysis is integral to their analytic development. Indeed, an analyst is actually never "made" but is always "in the making," developing and maturing in life and in practice. Reanalysis serves to focus elements of transference and resistance, rework defenses, facilitate more extensive regression in the service of the ego, deepen emotional integration, rework those elements of psychoanalysis itself that have been incorporated into defensive structure, and further the maturation of the analyzing instrument. If analysis is our most powerful mode of initial education, reanalysis is the most powerful form of continuing education. That remarkably little attention has been paid to reanalysis is testimony to the infantile fantasies that remain invested in our personal analyses.

Abstract = {Background: Recent studies have indicated that working memory is not a unitary resource and that different types of working memory are used for different types of linguistic processing: syntactic, semantic, and phonological. Phonological working memory was found to support the comprehension of sentences that require re-access to the word-form of a word that appeared earlier in the sentence. Aims: This study explored the relation between phonological working memory and sentence comprehension by testing the comprehension of garden path sentences in individuals with conduction aphasia who have very limited phonological working memory. Our prediction was that if phonological working memory limitation hampers word-form reactivation, only the comprehension of garden paths that require word-form reactivation will be impaired, whereas garden paths that require only structural reanalysis will be better preserved. Methods & Procedures: Five individuals with conduction aphasia and 15 matched controls participated in working memory tests and a garden path comprehension test. The phonological working memory assessment included a battery of 10 tests, which showed that four of the individuals, who had input conduction aphasia, had very limited phonological working memory, and one individual, with output conduction aphasia, had unimpaired working memory. The comprehension study included 60 garden path sentences of three types: structural garden paths, which require only structural reanalysis, lexical garden paths, which require lexical re-access in addition to structural reanalysis, and optional-complement garden paths, which require re-access to the lexical-syntactic frame of the verb in addition to the structural reanalysis. Outcomes & Results: The main result was that the individuals with input conduction aphasia showed different degrees of impairment in different types of garden path sentences. The lexical garden paths were exceptionally hard for them, with a mere 10% correct, and significantly more difficult than the structural garden paths. The individual with output conduction aphasia whose working memory was intact comprehended the lexical garden paths similarly to the normal controls. Conclusions: These findings indicate that phonological working memory impairment only affects the comprehension of sentences that require phonological, word-form re-access. The type of sentence and the type of processing it requires should be taken into account when trying to predict the effect of working memory limitation on a patient's ability to understand sentences. Whereas individuals with input conduction aphasia can understand complex syntactic structures well, they have considerable difficulties understanding sentences that also require re-access to a word-form.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the natural order of acquisition of the proform it, comparing deictic pronoun it, anaphoric pronoun it and expletive it. Files from four children (Adam, Eve, Nina and Peter) aged 1;6-3;0 in the CHILDES database were coded for occurrences of NP it (here it) and expletive it (it's raining). Occurrences of NP it were coded for whether they followed an overt discourse anaphor (anaphoric it) or not (deictic it). All children examined produce deictic and anaphoric pronoun it from the very first files, but do not produce expletive it until 2-7 months later. Following Inoue's (1991) lexical-semantic reanalysis account of the acquisition of expletive there after locative there, we propose that children acquire expletive it by reanalyzing referential pronoun it to include an expletive subtype. This reanalysis takes place when children realize that expletive it never co-occurs with any deictic/anaphoric referent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Two eye movement experiments examined effects on syntactic reanalysis when the correct analysis was briefly entertained at an earlier point in the sentence. In Experiment 1, participants read sentences containing a noun phrase coordination/clausal coordination ambiguity, while in Experiment 2 they read sentences containing a subordinate clause object/main clause subject ambiguity. The critical conditions were designed to induce readers to construct the ultimately correct analysis just prior to being garden-pathed by the incorrect analysis. In both experiments, the earliest measures of the garden path effect were not modulated by this manipulation. However, there was significantly less regressive re-reading of the sentence in those conditions in which the correct analysis was likely to have been constructed, then abandoned, at an earlier point. These results suggest that a syntactic analysis that is abandoned in the course of processing a sentence is not lost altogether, and can be re-activated or retrieved from memory. Implications for models of initial syntactic analysis and reanalysis are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: It has been suggested that there is a mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may interfere with antidepressant response, and poorer outcomes among NSAID-treated patients were reported in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. To attempt to confirm this association in an independent population-based treatment cohort and explore potential confounding variables, the authors examined use of NSAIDs and related medications among 1,528 outpatients in a New England health care system. Method: Treatment outcomes were classified using a validated machine learning tool applied to electronic medical records. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between medication exposure and treatment outcomes, adjusted for potential confounding variables. To further elucidate confounding and treatment specificity of the observed effects, data from the STAR*D study were reanalyzed. Results: NSAID exposure was associated with a greater likelihood of depression classified as treatment resistant compared with depression classified as responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (odds ratio=1.55, 95% CI=1.21–2.00). This association was apparent in the NSAIDs only group but not in those using other agents with NSAID-like mechanisms (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and salicylates). Inclusion of age, sex, ethnicity, and measures of comorbidity and health care utilization in regression models indicated confounding; association with outcome was no longer significant in fully adjusted models. Reanalysis of STAR*D results likewise identified an association in NSAIDs but not NSAID-like drugs, with more modest effects persisting after adjustment for potential confounding variables. Conclusions: These results support an association between NSAID use and poorer antidepressant outcomes in major depressive disorder but indicate that some of the observed effect may be a result of confounding.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether and when individuals with aphasia and healthy controls use lexical and prosodic information during on-line sentence comprehension. Individuals with aphasia and controls (n = 12 per group) participated in a self-paced listening experiment. The stimuli were early closure sentences, such as “While the parents watched(,) the child sang a song.” Both lexical and prosodic cues were manipulated. The cues were biased toward the subject- or object- of the ambiguous noun phrase (the child). Thus, there were two congruous conditions (in which both lexical cues and prosodic cues were consistent) and two incongruous conditions (in which lexical and prosodic cues conflicted). The results showed that the people with aphasia had longer listening times for the ambiguous noun phrase (the child) when the cues were conflicting, rather than consistent. The controls showed effects earlier in the sentence, at the subordinate verb (watched or danced). Both groups showed evidence of reanalysis at the main verb (sang). These effects demonstrate that the aphasic group was sensitive to the lexical and prosodic cues, but used them on a delayed time course relative to the control group.

Abstract = {It has been proposed that the brain predicts the sensory consequences of a movement and compares it to the actual sensory feedback. When the two differ, an error signal is formed, driving adaptation. How does an error in one trial alter performance in the subsequent trial? Here we show that the sensitivity to error is not constant but declines as a function of error magnitude. That is, one learns relatively less from large errors compared with small errors. We performed an experiment in which humans made reaching movements and randomly experienced an error in both their visual and proprioceptive feedback. Proprioceptive errors were created with force fields, and visual errors were formed by perturbing the cursor trajectory to create a visual error that was smaller, the same size, or larger than the proprioceptive error. We measured single-trial adaptation and calculated sensitivity to error, i.e., the ratio of the trial-to-trial change in motor commands to error size. We found that for both sensory modalities sensitivity decreased with increasing error size. A reanalysis of a number of previously published psychophysical results also exhibited this feature. Finally, we asked how the brain might encode sensitivity to error. We reanalyzed previously published probabilities of cerebellar complex spikes (CSs) and found that this probability declined with increasing error size. From this we posit that a CS may be representative of the sensitivity to error, and not error itself, a hypothesis that may explain conflicting reports about CSs and their relationship to error.

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of competing speech on auditory semantic comprehension using a dichotic sentence-word priming paradigm. Lexical decision performance for target words presented in spoken sentences was compared in strongly and weakly biasing semantic contexts. Targets were either congruent or incongruent with the sentential bias. Sentences were presented to one auditory channel (right or left), either in isolation or with competing speech produced by a single talker of the same gender presented simultaneously. The competing speech signal was either presented in the same auditory channel as the sentence context, or in a different auditory channel, and was either meaningful (played forward) or unintelligible (time-reversed). Biasing contexts presented in isolation facilitated responses to congruent targets and inhibited responses to incongruent targets, relative to a neutral baseline. Facilitation priming was reduced or eliminated by competing speech presented in the same auditory channel, supporting previous findings that semantic activation is highly sensitive to the intelligibility of the context signal. Competing speech presented in a different auditory channel affected facilitation priming differentially depending upon ear of presentation, suggesting hemispheric differences in the processing of the attended and competing signals. Results were consistent with previous claims of a right ear advantage for meaningful speech, as well as with visual word recognition findings implicating the left hemisphere in the generation of semantic predictions and the right hemisphere in the integration of newly encountered words into the sentence-level meaning. Unlike facilitation priming, inhibition was relatively robust to the energetic and informational masking effects of competing speech and was not influenced by the strength of the contextual bias or the meaningfulness of the competing signal, supporting a two-process model of sentence priming in which inhibition reflects later-stage, expectancy-driven strategic processes that may benefit from perceptual reanalysis after initial semantic activation.

Abstract = {Using event-related potentials, this study measured the access of suprasegmental (tone) and segmental (vowel) information in spoken word recognition with Mandarin idioms. Participants performed a delayed-response acceptability task, in which they judged the correctness of the last word of each idiom, which might deviate from the correct word in either tone or vowel. Results showed that, compared with the correct idioms, a larger early negativity appeared only for vowel violation. Additionally, a larger N400 effect was observed for vowel mismatch than tone mismatch. A control experiment revealed that these differences were not due to low-level physical differences across conditions; instead, they represented the greater constraining power of vowels than tones in the lexical selection and semantic integration of the spoken words. Furthermore, tone violation elicited a more robust late positive component than vowel violation, suggesting different reanalyses of the two types of information. In summary, the current results support a functional dissociation of tone and vowel processing in spoken word recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Vocal expressions commonly elicit activity in superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices, indicating a distributed network to decode vocally expressed emotions. We examined the involvement of this frontotemporal network for the decoding of angry voices during attention towards (explicit attention) or away from emotional cues in voices (implicit attention) based on a reanalysis of previous data (Frühholz, S., Ceravolo, L., Grandjean, D., 2012. Cerebral Cortex 22, 1107-1117). The general network revealed high interconnectivity of bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to different bilateral voice-sensitive regions in mid and posterior superior temporal gyri. Right superior temporal gyrus (STG) regions showed connectivity to the left primary auditory cortex and secondary auditory cortex (AC) as well as to high-level auditory regions. This general network revealed differences in connectivity depending on the attentional focus. Explicit attention to angry voices revealed a specific right–left STG network connecting higher-level AC. During attention to a nonemotional vocal feature we also found a left–right STG network implicitly elicited by angry voices that also included low-level left AC. Furthermore, only during this implicit processing there was widespread interconnectivity between bilateral IFG and bilateral STG. This indicates that while implicit attention to angry voices recruits extended bilateral STG and IFG networks for the sensory and evaluative decoding of voices, explicit attention to angry voices solely involves a network of bilateral STG regions probably for the integrative recognition of emotional cues from voices.

Abstract = {We examined whether the Concealed Information Test (CIT) may be used when the critical details are unavailable to investigators (the Searching CIT [SCIT]). This use may have important applications in criminal investigations (e.g., finding the location of a murder weapon) and in security-related threats (e.g., detecting individuals and groups suspected in planning a terror attack). Two classes of algorithms designed to detect the critical items and classify individuals in the SCIT were examined. The 1st class was based on averaging responses across subjects to identify critical items and on averaging responses across the identified critical items to identify knowledgeable subjects. The 2nd class used clustering methods based on the correlations between the response profiles of all subject pairs. We applied a principal component analysis to decompose the correlation matrix into its principal components and defined the detection score as the coefficient of each subject on the component that explained the largest portion of the variance. Reanalysis of 3 data sets from previous CIT studies demonstrated that in most cases the efficiency of differentiation between knowledgeable and unknowledgeable subjects in the SCIT (indexed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) approached that of the standard CIT for both algorithms. We also examined the robustness of our results to variations in the number of knowledgeable and unknowledgeable subjects in the sample. This analysis demonstrated that the performance of our algorithms is relatively robust to changes in the number of individuals examined in each group, provided that at least 2 (but desirably 5 or more) knowledgeable examinees are included.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 18(1) of Psychological Methods (see record [rid]2013-07795-003[/rid]). For the article, Drs. Daming Lin of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and George Tomlinson of Toronto General Hospital and the Dalla Lana School of Public Health noted an error in the final version of Equations 6 and 7 on page 423. Dr. Doebler, in a conversation with the Interim Editor, acknowledged the error in the printing of the equations. Dr. Doebler also checked and assured the Interim Editor that the R-code that generated the substantive results for the paper were correctly coded and are identical to the R-code that would result from the derivations suggested by Drs. Lin and Tomlinson and is provided.] We propose 2 related models for the meta-analysis of diagnostic tests. Both models are based on the bivariate normal distribution for transformed sensitivities and false-positive rates. Instead of using the logit as a transformation for these proportions, we employ the tα family of transformations that contains the log, logit, and (approximately) the complementary log. A likelihood ratio test for the cutoff value problem is developed, and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves are discussed. Worked examples showcase the methodology.

Abstract = {Executive function (EF), for example, is a set of cognitive processes—subsuming behavioral inhibition, working memory, and set shifting—that assist in goal-directed behavior, temporal organization of responses, and future-oriented actions in general. Prior studies have found that individual differences in EF predict medication adherence, health behavioral trajectories, and longevity. Given the potential conceptual overlap between conscientiousness and EF, we undertook a reanalysis of this dataset, which also included a measure of the Big Five dimensions of personality (the BFI), as well as accelerometer-assessed physical activity. We believe that although conscientiousness may be a potentially useful heuristic for thinking about health-related behaviors, risks, and outcomes, because there exists empirical overlap with EF—specifically, behavioral inhibition, the most "pure" facet of EF—some of this overlap could be responsible for the association between conscientiousness and outcomes of interest. In summary, we think that the link between conscientiousness and health outcomes is possibly an important one. However, we suggest that there is overlap between conscientiousness and executive function, and that the latter may be a more parsimonious (and powerful) explanatory variable for many health-related phenomena of interest. Careful reconsideration of the conscientiousness dimension from a social neuroscience perspective may be a useful direction forward. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Comments on Bipolar disorder and violent crime: New evidence from population-based longitudinal studies and systematic review (see record [rid]2010-19602-009[/rid]) by Fazel et al. It has come to our attention that the design that we used in the 2 longitudinal studies on violent crime in bipolar disorder underestimated the relative risks of violent crime associated with patients with bipolar disorder, although the absolute risks of violent offending and substance abuse in bipolar disorder remain unchanged. Our design measured rates of violent crime in controls from age 15 years and in cases from after diagnosis. This meant that the time at risk was not similar between cases and controls. We discussed various other potential biases in our article, including the reliance on hospital data to ascertain the cases (which will likely overestimate relative risks) and conviction information to measure violence as an outcome (which will underestimate absolute risks), but would like to address this limitation in the present letter.

Abstract = {In a previous publication, we reported that on the whole, young children in four cultures predictably made same-sex role choices (e.g., girls preferring daughter to son). But contrary to prediction, we found that children in two patricentric societies (patrilineal descent, etc.) made fewer same-sex role choices than did those from two societies without gender-biased social principles (bilateral descent, etc.) This surprising finding, which constituted an acknowledged puzzle for interpretation, prompted the current reanalysis of the dataset. Our new analysis has led to two conclusions: (a) children from the two patricentric societies, besides scoring lower on same-sex role choices, also scored a good deal lower on cognitive-performance tests, so they were generally poor test-takers; and (b) children in one of the patricentric societies—though not in any of the other samples—expressed a strong preference for higher-generation roles (i.e., mother and father). Discussion centers on plausible interpretations of these new-found results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We present three event-related potential studies that investigated the contribution of givenness and position-induced topicality (what a sentence is about) to information processing. The studies compared two types of referential expressions (given and inferred noun phrases (NPs)) in distinct sentential positions. The data revealed position-specific effects, reflected by an interaction of topicality and givenness: inferred NPs registered a more pronounced Late Positivity than given NPs in the canonical sentence-medial position, but not sentence-initially (Experiment 1). Additionally, there was a stable effect of givenness across positions, reflected by an N400 for inferred over given NPs. From a discourse dynamic perspective, the N400 is considered to reflect context-induced linking processes. The Late Positivity is associated with maintaining and updating discourse structure and manifests position-specific instructions for information storage. Subsequent studies strengthened this information packaging account by showing that the Late Positivity pattern is unaffected by syntactic function reanalysis (Experiment 2) or dislocation demands (Experiment 3).

Abstract = {This editorial presents the features of new DSM-5 and also explores the overview of previous edition of DSM. When the DSM-I was published in the early 1950s, it contained 108 descriptions of mental disorders referred to as reactions. Sixteen years later, in 1968, APA revised the DSM-II nosology to include 182 disorders and 10 classes of disorders described in less than 40 pages. In the 1980s, with the publication of the DSM-III, which had been expanded to 265 disorders and 17 categories, an attempt was made to empirically validate the classification of mental disorders. The DSM-III was also the first version of the manual that provided a definition of a mental disorder. Seven years later, in 1994, the DSM-IV was published. The DSM-IV contained 340 mental disorders, classified into 16 types, and its content was based on 150 reviews of the literature, reanalysis of 50 data sets already collected, and 12 issue-specific field trials. The highly anticipated publication of the DSM-5 has been released in May 2013. The DSM-5 have an organizational structure based on "clusters" of diagnoses that have been gleaned from the existing scientific evidence as being distinct from one another. DSM-5 includes cross-cutting dimensional assessment instruments, which have been designed to help increase diagnostic accuracy, assess severity, or track changes in severity during the treatment process.

Abstract = {A landmark research study from the 1950s was reanalyzed. Part of the study's results were confirmed, but other parts were found to have been incompletely analyzed and therefore incorrectly reported. Subsequent scholars who reviewed the study often did not distinguish between the accurate and inaccurate parts of the study. Furthermore, two of the main hypotheses of the study were that one variable (A) was not related to another variable (B) and that variable B was not related to another variable (C). In fact, both null hypotheses, insofar as data could be reconstructed from the original study, could be rejected. A reanalysis is presented here to encourage students in the family field to be bold and not accept published reports “just because” but to evaluate them carefully, perhaps even reanalyzing the data when available. It is hoped that scholars who submit reviews of the literature to Marriage and Family Review will use similar care and attention to assessing the scholarly literature in their particular areas of interest.

Abstract = {This editorial provides an example of how an older piece of research could be re-evaluated in light of improved statistical techniques. It is my hope that family studies instructors could take older examples of important research and subject them in their classrooms to similar scrutiny, asking students to find limitations in the reports and to consider possible ways the statistical analyses could have been improved. Students could be provided with the older articles first and then asked to compare their findings and suggestions with those in the later review or reanalysis. And, of course, they should discuss and critique the limitations of the latter. But more importantly, they should consider whether previous reviews of the literature "got it right" in terms of their interpretation of the scholarly evidence. On the other hand, some older articles may contain much of the original raw data, which can be extracted and subjected to re-analysis, with statistical techniques that are much improved over those available at the time to the authors of those older reports. Such data could be reanalyzed to determine if the pattern of wives having lower marital satisfaction or adjustment than their husbands existed several decades ago, long before later studies came along that looked at that particular gendered pattern for which considerable evidence was found.

Abstract = {Context: Some meta-analyses suggest that efficacy of antidepressants for major depression is overstated and limited to severe depression. Objective: To determine the short-term efficacy of antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder in youth, adult, and geriatric populations. Data Sources: Reanalysis of all intent-to-treat person-level longitudinal data during the first 6 weeks of treatment of major depressive disorder from 12 adult, 4 geriatric, and 4 youth randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine hydrochloride and 21 adult trials of venlafaxine hydrochloride. Study Selection: All sponsor-conducted randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine. Data Extraction: Children’s Depression Rating Scale– Revised scores (youth population), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores (adult and geriatric populations), and estimated response and remission rates at 6 weeks were analyzed for 2635 adults, 960 geriatric patients, and 708 youths receiving fluoxetine and for 2421 adults receiving immediate-release venlafaxine and 2461 adults receiving extended-release venlafaxine. Data Synthesis: Patients in all age and drug groups had significantly greater improvement relative to control patients receiving placebo. The differential rate of improvement was largest for adults receiving fluoxetine (34.6% greater than those receiving placebo). Youths had the largest treated vs control difference in response rates (24.1%) and remission rates (30.1%), with adult differences generally in the 15.6% (remission) to 21.4% (response) range. Geriatric patients had the smallest drug-placebo differences, an 18.5% greater rate of improvement, 9.9% for response and 6.5% for remission. Immediate-release venlafaxine produced larger effects than extended-release venlafaxine. Baseline severity could not be shown to affect symptom reduction. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first research synthesis in this area to use complete longitudinal person-level data from a large set of published and unpublished studies. The results do not support previous findings that antidepressants show little benefit except for severe depression. The antidepressants fluoxetine and venlafaxine are efficacious for major depressive disorder in all age groups, although more so in youths and adults compared with geriatric patients. Baseline severity was not significantly related to degree of treatment advantage over placebo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {There is growing debate about the situations of children who care for a relative with HIV-related illness, especially in developing countries with high HIV prevalence. In particular, there is inadequate information on the long-term consequences of children taking on this caregiving role. The article reanalyses data collected between January and November 2006 in a rural setting in western Kenya where 19 children caring for a total of 15 people living with HIV or AIDS (PLHIV) participated. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, participant observation, focus group discussions and narratives. The findings show that children regularly become involved in caregiving due to lack of a responsible adult to perform the role, which may be as a result of HIV stigma and rejection of the care recipient by extended family members and neighbours or because of cultural barriers. Fulfilling the responsibilities of caregiving had profound repercussions for the children’s lives, including psychological distress, physical burden, dropping out of school, participation in wage labour, and forced early marriage. Financial needs pushed some girls into transactional sexual relations, predisposing them to the risks of unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. Since the children providing care for PLHIV are themselves vulnerable, we recommend that they should be targeted with support. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Previous findings concerning the relation of risk aversion and cooperation in repeated prisoner’s dilemma games have been inconclusive. We hypothesized that this was due to an interaction between personality and environment. Specifically, we argued that in cooperation-friendly environments—given certain beliefs—defection is more risky than cooperation. The main reason for this is that, in such a situation, defection potentially yields outcomes of higher variance (and vice versa, for cooperation-unfriendly environments). In line with this hypothesis, we showed, in two experiments and a reanalysis of a study by Fudenberg, Rand, and Dreber (American Economic Review, in press), that the degree of cooperation increases with dispositional risk aversion in cooperation-friendly environments, but not in cooperation-unfriendly environments. We also found similar person–situation interactions for neuroticism and extraversion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Statistical modeling of school effectiveness data was originally motivated by the dissatisfaction with the analysis of (school-leaving) examination results that took no account of the background of the students or regarded each school as an isolated unit of analysis. The application of multilevel analysis was generally regarded as a breakthrough, although more recent assessments of how they satisfy the goals of school effectiveness studies, to compare the performances of schools, are much more guarded. This article shows that the association of the school effects with randomness is not necessary, because strength can be borrowed across the analyzed schools even when they are associated with fixed effects. The methods are illustrated on a reanalysis of the data from an early study of school effectiveness. It also addresses the problem of excess zero outcomes by treating them as censored (truncated).

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 52(7) of Personality and Individual Differences (see record [rid]2012-06763-012[/rid]). In the original article, a coding error in the NEO personality measure was discovered. A reanalysis of the affected models found only slight differences that do not substantially change the interpretation of regression model results. However, there were several minor ramifications. The correctly coded model resulted in stronger overall fits for both the Personality Model [Old R2 change = 2.975, p = 0.008; New R2 change = 8.259, p < 0.001] and the Cumulative Model, [Old: R2 = 0.306; New: R2 = 0.346] and also changed the contribution of the underlying subscales slightly. Whereas the Openness factor of the NEO had previously not significantly predicted spectating, in the correctly coded data this relationship became significant (β = −0.171, p = 0.005). In addition, the previously reported positive correlation between spectating and the Extroversion 'gregariousness' facet (β = 0.039, p = 0.048) no longer reach criterion significance (β= 0.112, p = 0.153).] Despite the prominence of sports in contemporary society, little is known about the identity and personality traits of sports spectators. With a sample of 293 individuals, we examine four broad categories of factors that may explain variability in the reported amount of time spent watching sports. Using individual difference regression techniques, we explore the relationship between sports spectating and physiological measures (e.g., testosterone and cortisol), clinical self-report scales (ADHD and autism), personality traits (e.g., NEO “Big Five”), and pastime activities (e.g., video game playing). Our results indicate that individuals who report higher levels of sports spectating tend to have higher levels of extraversion, and in particular excitement seeking and gregariousness. These individuals also engage more in complementary pastime activities, including participating in sports and exercise activities, watching TV/movies, and playing video games. Notably, no differences were observed in the clinical self-report scales, indicating no differences in reported symptoms of ADHD or autism for spectators and non-spectators. Likewise, no relationship was seen between baseline concentrations of testosterone or cortisol and sports spectating in our sample. These results provide an assessment of the descriptive personality dimensions of frequent sports spectators and provide a basic taxonomy of how these traits are expressed across the population.

Abstract = {The evidence for associations between genetic polymorphisms and complex behavioral/psychological phenotypes (traits) has thus far been weak and inconsistent. Using the well-studied Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene as an example, we demonstrate that using theoretical models to guide phenotype definition and measuring the phenotypes of interest with a high degree of specificity reveals strong gene–behavior associations that are consistent with prior work and that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Only after statistically controlling for irrelevant portions of phenotype variance did we observe strong (Cohen's d = 0.33–0.70) and significant associations between COMT Val158Met and both cognitive and affective traits in a healthy male sample (N = 201) in Study 1: Carriers of the Met allele scored higher in fluid intelligence (reasoning) but lower in both crystallized intelligence (general knowledge) and the agency facet of extraversion. In Study 2, we conceptually replicated the association of COMT Val158Met with the agency facet of extraversion after partialing irrelevant phenotype variance in a female sample (N = 565). Finally, through reanalysis of a large published data set we showed that Met allele carriers also scored higher in indicators of fluid intelligence after partialing verbal fluency. Because the Met allele codes for a less efficient variant of the enzyme COMT, resulting in higher levels of extrasynaptic prefrontal dopamine, these observations provide further support for a role for dopamine in both intelligence and extraversion. More importantly, the present findings have important implications for the definition of psychological phenotypes in neurogenetic research.

Abstract = {Both animal and human studies have identified a critical role of the hippocampus in contextual fear conditioning. In humans mainly functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used. To extend these findings to volumetric properties, 58 healthy participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and participated in a differential fear conditioning paradigm with contextual stimuli. Ratings of emotional valence, arousal, and contingency as well as skin conductance responses (SCRs) were used as indicators of conditioning. Twenty-nine participants with the smallest hippocampal volumes were compared with 29 persons with the largest hippocampal volumes. Persons with larger hippocampal volume (especially on the right side) learned to discriminate between two conditioned contexts, whereas those with small hippocampal volumes did not, as indicated by SCRs. Further analyses showed that these results could not be explained by amygdalar volumes. In contrast, the participant answers on the self-report measures were not significantly influenced by hippocampal or amygdalar, but by total brain volume, suggesting a role of cortical structures in these more cognitive evaluation processes. Reanalysis of the self-report data using partial hippocampal volumes revealed a significant influence of the posterior but not anterior subvolumes, which is in accordance with theories and empirical findings on hippocampal functioning. This study shows the relevance of hippocampal volume for contextual fear conditioning in healthy volunteers and may have important implications for anxiety disorders.

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of including unpublished trial outcome data obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the results of meta-analyses of drug trials. Design: Reanalysis of meta-analyses. Data sources: Drug trials with unpublished outcome data for new molecular entities that were approved by the FDA between 2001 and 2002 were identified. For each drug, eligible systematic reviews containing at least one meta-analysis were identified by searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library in November 2010. Selection criteria: Eligible systematic reviews were done after FDA approval of the drug, were published in English, and had outcomes and comparators that were the same as those of the trials with unpublished FDA trial outcomes, and the characteristics of participants in the systematic reviews were consistent with the FDA approved indication for the drug. Clinical guidelines, conference proceedings, duplicate systematic reviews, and systematic reviews in which included trials were not referenced or that combined trials across multiple drug classes were excluded. Systematic reviews using non-standard meta-analytic techniques (such as Bayesian or network meta-analyses) and those that used inappropriate or invalid methods for calculation of summary statistics (such as unweighted pooled analyses) were also excluded. Data extraction: Two authors independently extracted data from both the published systematic reviews and the FDA’s medical and statistical reviews of the trials submitted to FDA. Main outcome measure: Summary statistics (risk ratios, odds ratios, or weighted mean differences) for relevant outcomes with and without unpublished FDA trial data. Results: 42 meta-analyses (41 efficacy outcomes, one harm outcome) for nine drugs across six drug classes were reanalysed. Overall, addition of unpublished FDA trial data caused 46% (19/41) of the summary estimates from the meta-analyses to show lower efficacy of the drug, 7% (3/41) to show identical efficacy, and 46% (19/41) to show greater efficacy. The summary estimate of the single harm outcome showed more harm from the drug after inclusion of unpublished FDA trial data. Conclusion: The effect of including unpublished FDA trial outcome data varies by drug and outcome. Unpublished FDA trial outcome data should be available and included in meta-analysis. Making these data easily accessible is particularly important because the effects of including unpublished data vary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) is firmly established as the primary outcome measure for use in Phase III trials of interventions in traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the GOS has been criticized for its lack of sensitivity to detect small but clinically relevant changes in outcome. The Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) potentially addresses this criticism, and in this study we estimate the efficiency gain associated with using the GOSE in place of the GOS in ordinal analysis of 6-month outcome. The study uses both simulation and the reanalysis of existing data from two completed TBI studies, one an observational cohort study and the other a randomized controlled trial. As expected, the results show that using an ordinal technique to analyze the GOS gives a substantial gain in efficiency relative to the conventional analysis, which collapses the GOS onto a binary scale (favorable versus unfavorable outcome). We also found that using the GOSE gave a modest but consistent increase in efficiency relative to the GOS in both studies, corresponding to a reduction in the required sample size of the order of 3–5%. We recommend that the GOSE be used in place of the GOS as the primary outcome measure in trials of TBI, with an appropriate ordinal approach being taken to the statistical analysis.

Abstract = {The so-called action vs. perception model represents one of the currently dominating models addressing visual processing in primates. One of the crucial cornerstones of the action vs. perception model of visual processing is the dissociation of impaired perception versus intact visuomotor control in neurological patients with visual form agnosia (VFA). In fact, virtually all evidence related to VFA supporting the model was reported from only one patient: patient D.F. Through the last two decades D.F. became as important as only very few other exemplar cases in the neurosciences. However, a large corpus of experiments with this individual used methods that were insufficient to reveal less obvious impairments on a single subject level. We reanalysed the data of D.F. and identified basic visuomotor impairments that had been overlooked so far. Our reanalysis underlines the fact that the widespread and popular presentation of strong dissociations between distinct visual systems seems to be exaggerated.

Abstract = {Intersubjective consensus approaches to culture have emerged as a new paradigm for understanding and measuring culture. In this study, I briefly review contemporary definitions of culture in psychology and examine how an intersubjective norm approach may fit. Two central issues are (1) consensus about the norms and (2) the ability to discriminate between individuals from different cultural contexts based on their responses. A reanalysis of intersubjective norms (Fischer, 2006) demonstrates that consensus is low and relatively little variance is explained by cultural background. This challenges the theoretical nature of the construct as capturing culturally shared meaning systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 27(2) of Psychology and Aging (see record [rid]2012-15395-001[/rid]). The authors discovered that the method proposed for individually extracting priming effects from time course analysis may lead to some spurious effects. In view of possible spurious effects from their application of time course analysis, the authors adopted an alternative strategy that retains their attempt to take an individual approach to identifying NCEs in older participants who may vary more than young participants in terms of the prime-target SOA at which NCEs initially appear. This reanalysis is presented in the erratum.] Inhibitory control functions in old age were investigated with the “masked prime” paradigm in which participants executed speeded manual choice responses to simple visual targets. These were preceded—either immediately or at some earlier time—by a backward-masked prime. Young adults produced positive compatibility effects (PCEs)—faster and more accurate responses for matching than for nonmatching prime-target pairs—when prime and target immediately followed each other, and the reverse effect (negative compatibility effect, NCE) for targets that followed the prime after a short interval. Older adults produced similar PCEs to young adults, indicating intact low-level motor activation, but failed to produce normal NCEs even with longer delays (Experiment 1), increased opportunity for prime processing (Experiment 2), and prolonged learning (Experiment 3). However, a fine-grained analysis of each individual's time course of masked priming effects revealed NCEs in the majority of older adults, of the same magnitude as those of young adults. These were significantly delayed (even more than expected on the basis of general slowing), indicating a disproportionate impairment of low-level inhibitory motor control in old age.

Abstract = {Lilienfeld, Garb, and Wood (2011) commented on our recently published meta-analysis (Poston & Hanson, 2010). In their thorough, fine-grained critique, they questioned the study's inclusion criteria, sampling, and results, suggesting the latter are “overstated” (p. 1048). Additionally, they discussed the Barnum effect, suggesting that it accounts, at least partially, for the potential efficacy and/or effectiveness of psychological assessment as a therapeutic intervention (PATI). In addressing Lilienfeld et al.'s (2011) concerns, we incorporate their suggestions and present new findings based on the original data set, including 15 independent and 56 dependent effect sizes (ESs). Upon reanalysis, a comparable, significant overall Cohen's d ES of 0.403 (95% CI [0.302, 0.503]) was found, thus building confidence in our original results, as well as the overall efficacy of PATI. Given PATI's potential treatment utility, we mention possible change mechanisms, above and beyond Barnum effects. And finally, in hopes of launching the field forward, we offer suggestions for future research and collaboration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Participant's eye-movements were recorded while they read locally ambiguous sentences. Evidence for processing difficulty was found when the interpretation of the initially preferred misanalysis clashed with that of the globally correct analysis, demonstrating the persistence of the earlier interpretation. Processing difficulty associated with the syntactic reanalysis was largely localised to the disambiguating region, with difficulty due to semantic persistence occurring later. The results show that semantic persistence is not limited to extreme cases of parse failure, and can occur even when reanalysis is relatively straightforward.

Abstract = {Despite recurring concerns about common method variance (CMV) in survey research, the information systems (IS) community remains largely uncertain of the extent of such potential biases. To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.

Abstract = {Objective: To propose and test a method that produces an unbiased estimate of the average effect of smoking cessation on weight gain. Previous estimates may be biased due to unobservable differences in attributes of quitters and continuing smokers. An accurate estimate of weight gain due to cessation is important for policymakers, health managers, clinicians, consumers, and developers of smoking cessation aids. Study Setting: Our analysis consisted of an instrumental variables (IVs) approach in which treatment assignment in randomized smoking cessation trials served as a random source of variation in probability of quitting. Data Collection: We searched the medical literature for previously conducted smoking cessation trials that contained data suitable for our reanalysis. Principal Findings: We identified one trial for our reanalysis, the Lung Health Study, a randomized smoking cessation trial with 5,887 smokers aged 35-60 from 1986 to 1994 in several sites across the United States. In our IV reanalysis, we estimated a 9.7 kg weight gain over 5 years due to cessation, as compared with the conventional estimate of 5.3 kg. Conclusions: The true effect of smoking cessation on weight gain may be larger than previously estimated. This result indicates the importance of fully understanding the possible weight effects of cessation and underscores the need to accompany cessation programs with weight management interventions. The result, however, does not overturn the conclusion that the net health benefits of quitting are positive and very large. The application of the IV technique we propose is likely to be useful in a variety of contexts in which one is interested in the effect of one health condition on another.

Abstract = {Four published reanalyses of part of the celebrated medical innovation data focus on network effects on the diffusion of tetracycline. Each reanalysis rejects the findings of the previous analysis. This article shows that in the early 1950s, when the original data were collected, private practice physicians, swamped by demand, but facing threats to their autonomy from the federal government and from university medical centers, struggled to keep up with new therapies and relied on colleagues and friends within the profession for help and advice. This article examines the reanalyses' judgment calls concerning the use of a psychophysics power function, the employment of a time-sensitive model, the imputation and exclusion of data, and the addition of new variables. Given the radical undecidability of numerical evidence in the absence of context, the reanalysis of stand-alone data is likely to produce a continuing series of conflicting results.

Abstract = {The passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB, 2002), with its Reading First program provisions, marked a new sort of federal educational policy making in several ways. The NCLB Act federalized reading policy and debates about how best to teach reading moved from teacher lounges and school board meetings to state capitols and finally to the White House and Congress. Congress established a National Reading Panel (NRP) to review the research and report back with conclusions about what the research indicated about effective beginning reading instruction. Three articles in this special issue focus primarily on the report of the National Reading Panel. In one of the articles, three authors review their earlier reanalyses of the NRP phonics data and then provide a refined and extended reanalysis using multilevel modeling. Another article focuses on the comprehension section of the NRP report rather than on the analyses of phonics instruction. The final article discusses the "sustaining myths" and "necessary illusions" central to recent educational policy making in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Abstract = {This study considers the principle that governs syntactic parser's revision processes by investigating how the parser resolves temporary ambiguities which emerge during reanalysis. Previous studies which addressed this issue have argued that the parser prefers preserving as many existing structure and interpretation as possible. This study, however, argues that the hypothesis emphasizing preserving the existing structure needs to be revised and presents the Error Signal-based Revision Principle (ESRP). The ESRP requires the parser to constructs a maximal projection which has a minimal number of nodes dominating the error signal and can be attached into the existing structure in a legitimate way such that the rules of grammar are not violated. We demonstrate that the ESRP can correctly explain the parser's preference in resolving temporary ambiguities during reanalysis. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence from an experiment employing the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) technique which indicate that the ESRP is more plausible than the structure-preserving principle as an ambiguity-resolution principle. Finally, we argue that the ESRP is consistent with the assumption that the parser performs its task in the "least effort" way. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Utilizing standardization and validation data from the NEPSY, this study presents a reanalysis of the High-Functioning Autism (HFA) versus Typical samples using IQ as a covariate. The reanalysis in the present paper should prove important to clinicians and researchers by (1) determining if the original findings can be replicated for the HFA sample when controlling for IQ, and (2) providing neuropsychological description for children with HFA versus Typical children across the NEPSY variables. The sample included 23 children with HFA who ranged in age from 5 years 5 months to 12 years 11 months (Mean = 9.59 years). The HFA Group comprised 19 males, 22 Caucasians, and was 87% right handed. All of the parents had between 12 to 15 years of education. A Typical Group was selected from the standardization sample of the NEPSY and matched on the variables of chronological age, race, gender, parental education, and region of the country. A MAN-COVA revealed significant group differences on 8 of the 14 core subtests of the NEPSY, with the HFA Group performing lower than the Typical Group. While these findings significantly overlapped with those from the original validation study, significant group differences also were uncovered for the subtests of Phonological Processing, Auditory Attention and Response Set, and Speeded Naming; Comprehension of Instructions and Narrative Memory were no longer significant after controlling for IQ. When the groups were compared with respect to the number of cases falling below the 10th percentile, the HFA Group showed a higher rate of occurrence on each subtest, but only significantly so on the Arrows Subtest. These findings provide additional support for the phenotypic neurocognitive presentation of individuals with HFA, and they suggest that the NEPSY can contribute to the neuropsychological description of children with HFA.

Abstract = {Reanalysis in language comprehension provides a window on how superficially similar processes of conflict resolution may differ depending on the context in which they are initiated. Thus, previous ERP studies have shown that reanalyses towards object-initial orders in German sentences with dative-active verbs (e.g., folgen, 'to follow') engender N400 effects, while reanalyses with accusative verbs (e.g., besuchen, 'to visit') elicit P600 effects. This difference appears surprising since these two verb classes are both associated with a subject-initial base order. The present paper reports two ERP experiments designed to shed further light on the nature of the conflict resolution processes involved in each case by examining structures in which word order disambiguation is separated from verb class disambiguation. Experiment 1 contrasted dative-active verbs with accusative verbs, while Experiment 2 compared dative-active and dative object-experiencer verbs (which are associated with an object-initial base order). Our results show that the reanalysis pattern for dative-active constructions is context-dependent: when verb class disambiguation precedes word order disambiguation, an N400-P600 pattern results. By contrast, the reanalysis patterns for the other two verb types are context independent: object-experiencer verbs invariably show an N400 and accusative verbs invariably show a P600. We argue that (a) the N400 is a general marker of reanalysis in dative sentences, reflecting an argument reindexation, while (b) the P600 in accusative sentences reflects a structural recomputation. The variable pattern for dative-active sentences reflects the (in)applicability of "good-enough" representations during conflict resolution in garden path sentences.

Abstract = {Background: In former days, information obtained from randomized well-controlled clinical trials and epidemiological studies on premature ejaculation (PE) was not available, thereby hampering the efforts of the consecutive DSM Work Groups on Sexual Disorders to formulate an evidence-based definition of PE. The current DSM-IV-TR definition of PE is still nonevidence based. In addition, the requirement that persistent self-perceived PE, distress, and interpersonal difficulties, in absence of a quantified ejaculation time, are necessary to establish the diagnosis remains disputable. Aim: To investigate the validity and reliability of DSM and ICD diagnosis of premature ejaculation. Methods: The historical development of DSM and ICD classification of mental disorders is critically reviewed, and two studies using the DSM-IV-TR definition of PE is critically reanalyzed. Results: Reanalysis of two studies using the DSM-IV-TR definition of PE has shown that DSM-diagnosed PE can be accompanied by long intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) values. The reanalysis revealed a low positive predictive value for the DSM-IV-TR definition when used as a diagnostic test. A similar situation pertains to the American Urological Association (AUA) definition of PE, which is practically a copy of the DSM-IV-TR definition. Conclusion: It should be emphasized that any evidence-based definition of PE needs objectively collected patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from epidemiological studies, as well as reproducible quantifications of the IELT.

Abstract = {Background: Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)is associated with a high degree of impairment in social skills, family interaction, and academic functioning. Comorbid ODD is reportedly present in 40% to 70% of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Objective: The goal of this study was to assess theefficacy and safety of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (MAS XR) for the treatment of ODD in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Methods: This was a 4-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose-escalation study. Patients were randomized to receive active treatment with MAS XR 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg/d or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the ODD subscale of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV) parent rating. Primary safety measures included adverse events recorded at each visit and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation, and changes in vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, laboratory tests and physical examinations, and body weight. A post hoc efficacy reanalysis was completed based on the results for the per-protocol population. For this analysis, patients were divided into high and low baseline severity categories according to the dichotomized baseline ODD parent or teacher score or dichotomized baseline ADHD parent or teacher score (high defined as scores at the median or greater and low defined as scores less than the median). Results: A total of 308 children and adolescents (age range, 6-17 years; 213 males, 95 females) were randomized to receive active treatment with MAS XR 10 mg/d (n = 60) 20 mg/d (n = 58), 30 mg/d (n = 69), or 40 mg/d (n = 61) or placebo (n = 60). Of the 308 study patients, 244 (79.2%) had comorbid ADHD. A significant change from baseline in the ODD symptoms measured with the SNAP-IV parent rating subscale was found for the MAS XR 30-mg/d (-0.52; P < 0.001) and 40-mg/d (-0.56; P = 0.002) groups in the per-protocol analysis and for the MAS XR 30-mg/d group in the intent-to-treat analysis (-0.42; P < 0.005). Throughout the study, MAS XR was well tolerated in these children and adolescents with ODD, and most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequently reported adverse events occurring in MAS XR-treated patients were anorexia/decreased appetite (25.3%), insomnia (19.5%), headache (18.5%), and abdominal pain (10.7%). Statistically, but not clinically, significant decreases in body weight were seen with MAS XR (range, -1.1 to -3.5 lb; P < 0.001 vs placebo). Changes in laboratory values, ECG measurements, and physical and other vital signs were also not clinically significant. The post hoc reanalysis was based on the per-protocol population (n = 229). An assessment of the high baseline symptom severity subgroups showed a good response to MAS XR treatment for the SNAP-IV parent and teacher rating scales (both, P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study found that higher doses of MAS XR (30 and 40 mg) were effective and well tolerated in the management of ODD in these school-aged children and adolescents in the presence or absence of ADHD.

Abstract = {The degree to which native and non-native readers interpret English sentences incrementally was investigated by examining plausibility effects on reanalysis processes. Experiment 1 required participants to read sentences word by word and to make on-line plausibility judgements. The results showed that natives and non-natives immediately computed the plausibility of the preferred structural analysis, which then affected ease of reanalysis. Experiment 2 required participants to read the same sentences word by word in order to perform a memory task. The natives showed a similar pattern of results to Experiment 1, whereas for the non-natives plausibility effects were delayed. However, the non-natives still appeared to be performing immediate syntactic reanalysis. It is concluded that syntactic processing was person- and task-independent, whereas the incrementality of interpretation was more dependent on task demands for the non-natives than for the natives.

Abstract = {A multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of bupropion for methamphetamine dependence was reanalyzed using a novel, nonbinary method of evaluating success and failure. The original analysis focused on a group response endpoint (the change in percentage of participants with methamphetamine-free urines each week over the course of the trial) and no significant bupropion effect was observed in the total population of study participants. In this reanalysis, individual participants were regarded as treatment success if they achieved multiple weeks of abstinence lasting through the end of the study, and their degree of success was quantified by calculating the number of beyond-threshold weeks of success (NOBWOS). Thus, setting the threshold at 1 week of end-of-study abstinence (EOSA), treatment successes were assigned NOBWOS values ranging from 1 to 11, with 1 corresponding to 2 weeks EOSA and 11 corresponding to abstinence throughput the entire 12-week trial. Treatment failures were assigned a value of 0. Comparison of NOBWOS values revealed a significant effect of bupropion to facilitate abstinence (P = 0.0176). In the bupropion group, 20% of participants achieved 2 or more weeks EOSA, 14% achieved 6 or more weeks EOSA, and 6% were abstinent throughout the trial; this compares with 7%, 4%, and 1% in the placebo group, respectively. On the basis of the NOBWOS analysis, bupropion seems to effectively facilitate the achievement of abstinence in methamphetamine-dependent individuals.

Abstract = {Semantic preview benefit from parafoveal words is critical for proposals of distributed lexical processing during reading. Semantic preview benefit has been demonstrated for Chinese reading with the boundary paradigm in which unrelated or semantically related previews of a target word N + 1 are replaced by the target word once the eyes cross an invisible boundary located after word N (Yan et al., 2009); for the target word in position N + 2, only identical compared to unrelated-word preview led to shorter fixation times on the target word (Yan et al., in press). A reanalysis of these data reveals that identical and semantic preview benefits depend on preview duration (i.e., the fixation duration on the preboundary word). Identical preview benefit from word N + 1 increased with preview duration. The identical preview benefit was also significant for N + 2, but did not significantly interact with preview duration. The previously reported semantic preview benefit from word N + 1 was mainly due to single- or first-fixation durations following short previews. We discuss implications for notions of serial attention shifts and parallel distributed processing of words during reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The Five-factor theory of personality (FFT) has pervaded personality research in recent years. Although many reliable and valid measurement instruments exist for use with adults, adolescents, and even elementary-age children, there is a lack of available 5-factor measurement tools for use with preschool children. This article expands on previous work developing the M5–PS, a rating form for preschool children designed to be completed by classroom teachers or caregivers. A total of 621 children were rated by their teachers on the 90-item working form of the M5–PS. Through a combination of empirical and rational scale refinement methods, the number of items has been reduced to 35, yielding a revised instrument, the M5–PS–35, with substantially improved construct validity and scale internal consistency. Potential changes in external validity were evaluated by comparative reanalysis of an existing data set. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Viswanathan et al.’s (1996, Nature, 381, 413e415) analysis of the flight patterns of the wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans, led to an explosion of interest in biological Lévy flights and to an accumulation of evidence that a wide variety of animals have movement patterns that can be approximated by Lévy flights. Subsequently, it became apparent that the analysis of Viswanathan et al. (1996) was seriously flawed. Attributing Lévy flights to wandering albatrosses now appeared to be an error that nevertheless served as the basis for new insights into animal behaviour. Here I revisit the issue in light of recent evidence that fishy-scented odours facilitate prey location in these birds. Using a simple mathematical argument I show that the touchdown locations (positions of the located odour sources) of odour-mediated anemotactic (upwind) flight patterns form a Lévy ‘dust’. Lévy flight patterns are therefore predicted to be an emergent property of olfactory searching in turbulent environments. In accordance with the reanalysis of the empirical data, flight lengths are predicted to be gamma distributed when prey lying in nearby crosswind locations can occasionally be detected by purely visual means. These predictions are supported by the results of numerical simulations. The finding invites a further reexamination of the flight patterns of the wandering albatross and provides new insights into the movement patterns of many animals that can locate odour sources in turbulent environments.

Abstract = {Sloutsky and Fisher (2012) attempt to reframe the results presented in Noles and Gelman (2012) as a pure replication of their original work validating the similarity, induction, naming, and categorization (SINC) model. However, their critique fails to engage with the central findings reported in Noles and Gelman, and their reanalysis fails to examine the key comparison of theoretical interest. In addition to responding to the points raised in Sloutsky and Fisher's (2012) critique, we elaborate on the pragmatic factors and methodological flaws present in Sloutsky and Fisher (2004) that biased children's similarity judgments. Our careful replication of that study suggests that, rather than measuring the influence of labels on judgments of perceptual similarity, the original design measured sensitivity to the pragmatics of task demands. Together, the results reported in Noles and Gelman and the methodological problems highlighted here represent a serious challenge to the validity of the SINC model specifically and the words-as-features view more generally.

Abstract = {This article reports the results of an eye-tracking experiment that investigated the processing of coordinate structures in Chinese sentence comprehension. The study tracked the eye movements of native Chinese readers as they read sentences consisting of two independent clauses connected by the word huo zhe. The data strongly confirmed readers’ preference for an initial noun phrase (NP)-coordination parsing in Chinese coordination structure. When huo zhe was absent from the beginning of a sentence, we identified a cost associated with abandoning the NP-coordination analysis, which was evident with regard to the second NP when the coordination was unambiguous. Otherwise, this cost was evident with regard to the verb, the syntactically disambiguating region, when the coordination was ambiguous. However, the presence of a sentence-initial huo zhe reduced reading times and regressions in the huo zhe NP and the verb regions. We believe that the word huo zhe at the beginning of a sentence helps the reader predict that the sentence contains a parallel structure. Before the corresponding phrases appear, the readers can use the word huo zhe and the language structure thereafter to predicatively construct the syntactic structure. Such predictive capability can eliminate the reader’s preference for NP-coordination analysis. Implications for top-down parsing theory and models of initial syntactic analysis and reanalysis are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: Studies that compare the effects of problem-based and conventional medical curricula on student performance generally show no significant differences. However, curriculum comparison studies are at best quasi-experimental, so they are prone to forms of selection bias. The purpose of this study was to reanalyze data from such comparisons by controlling for two potential biases: differential student attrition and differential exposure. Method: The authors reanalyzed 104 previously published comparisons involving a single, problem-based medical school in the Netherlands (Maastricht University’s medical school), using student attrition and study duration data from this school and the schools with which it was compared. The authors removed bias by reequalizing the comparison groups in terms of attrition and study duration. Results: The uncorrected data showed no differences between problem-based and conventional curricula: Mean effect sizes as expressed by Cohen d were 0.02 for medical knowledge and 0.07 for diagnostic reasoning. However, the reanalysis demonstrated medium-level effect sizes favoring the problem-based curriculum. After corrections for attrition and study duration, the mean effect size for knowledge acquisition was 0.31 and for diagnostic reasoning was 0.51. Conclusions: Effects of the Maastricht problem-based curriculum were masked by differential attrition and differential exposure in the original studies. Because this school has been involved in many studies included in influential literature reviews published in the past 20 years, the authors’ findings have implications for the assessment of the value of problem-based learning put forward by these reviews.

Abstract = {Introduction: The popularity of smoking cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis has grown rapidly. Differences in models and inputs mean results may not be comparable, and researchers may have to take them on trust because the methods: are beyond their expertise and not always transparent. We describe a direct method and tables of results for researchers without specialist knowledge. Methods: We estimate the health benefit to an individual attributed to an intervention and compute tables of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for interventions with varying incremental intervention effects and costs. Estimates of life years gained come from the longest epidemiological study. After discounting, adjustments are made for future cessation and relapse. The method is described in simple steps, and conservative inputs are used throughout. Results: To look up an ICER, the user needs only to know the cost of the intervention per smoker and the effect as measured by the percentage of ex-smokers attributable to the intervention at either 6- or 12-month follow-up. Reanalysis of authoritative reports indicates that these ICERs are comparable to those from decision-analytic simulation models. Conclusions: Researchers can now obtain immediate estimates of the CE of interventions in general populations. The method is easily programmed in a spreadsheet. ICERs are from the payer perspective and exclude offset and societal costs. Interventions in subpopulations will require inputs specific to those populations. Readers who wish to include an adjustment for quality of life can easily do so. The tables might promote a standard approach, with interventions compared on a consistent and transparent basis.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between overuse of healthcare services and geographic variations in medical care. Design: Systematic Review. Data Sources: Articles published in Medline between 1978, the year of publication of the first framework to measure quality, and January 1,2009. Study Selection: Four investigators screened 114,830 titles and 2 investigators screened all selected abstracts and articles for possible inclusion and extracted all data. Data Extraction: We extracted data on rates of overuse in different geographic areas. We also extracted data on underuse, if available, for the same population in which overuse was measured. Results: Five papers examined the relationship between geographic variations and overuse of healthcare services. One study in 2008 compared the appropriateness of coronary angiography (CA) for acute myocardial infarction in high-cost areas versus low cost areas in the Medicare population and found largely similar rates of inappropriateness (12.2% vs. 16.2%). A study in 2000 using national data concluded that overuse of CA explained little of the geographic variations in the use of this procedure in the Medicare program. An older study of Medicare patients found similar rates of inappropriate use of CA (15% to 17% vs. 18%), endoscopy (15% vs. 18% 19%), and carotid endar-terectomy (29% vs. 30%) in low-use and high-use regions. A small area reanalysis of data from this study of 3 procedures found no evidence of a relationship between inappropriate use of procedures and volume in 23 adjacent counties of California. Another 2008 study found that inappropriate chemotherapy for stage I cancer was less common in lowcost areas compared with high-cost areas (3.1% vs. 6.3%). Conclusions: The limited available evidence does not lend support to the hypothesis that inappropriate use of procedures is a major source of geographic variations in intensity and/or costs of care. More research is needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between geographic variations and the quality of care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Barnes, Marissa Blanco and Laurie R. Santos (Developmental Science, 2009[Nov], Vol 12[6], 920-928). The original article, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editors in Chief, Michelle De Haan and Charles Nelson and John Wiley & Sons Limited. The authors determined that the looking time coding performed by the first author, N. Mahajan, was inaccurate and did not reflect the looking times found by other trained coders. A reanalysis of the data reported in this paper failed to verify the reported effects, and thus the authors have requested that the publication be retracted. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-19128-011[/rid]). Both human infants and adult non-human primates share the capacity to track small numbers of objects across time and occlusion. The question now facing developmental and comparative psychologists is whether similar mechanisms give rise to this capacity across the two populations. Here, we explore whether non-human primates' object tracking abilities are subject to the same constraints as those of human infants. In particular, we examine whether one primate species, the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), also fails to represent and enumerate objects when they behave non-rigidly or non-cohesively. We presented lemurs with a series of expectancy violation studies involving simple 1 + 1 addition events in which we varied the entities to be enumerated. Like infants, lemurs successfully enumerated the two objects when those objects were rigid, cohesive individuals, but failed to enumerate similar-looking non-rigid piles of sand. In contrast to human infants, however, lemurs successfully enumerated non-cohesive objects that broke into multiple pieces. These results are discussed in light of recent theories about object processing in human infants and adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Animacy is known to play an important role in language processing and production, but debate remains as to how it exerts its effects: (1) through links to syntactic ordering, (2) through inherent differences between animate and inanimate entities in their salience/lexico-semantic accessibility, and (3) through links to specific thematic roles. We contrasted these three accounts in two event-related potential (ERP) experiments examining the processing of direct object arguments in simple English sentences. In Experiment 1, we found a larger N400 to animate than inanimate direct object arguments assigned the Patient role, ruling out the second account. In Experiment 2, we found no difference in the N400 evoked by animate direct object arguments assigned the Patient role (prototypically inanimate) and those assigned the Experiencer role (prototypically animate), ruling out the third account. We therefore suggest that animacy may impact processing through a direct link to syntactic linear ordering, at least on postverbal arguments in English. We also examined processing on direct object arguments that violated the animacy-based selection-restriction constraints of their preceding verbs. These violations evoked a robust P600, which was not modulated by thematic role assignment or reversibility, suggesting that the so-called semantic P600 is driven by overall propositional impossibility, rather than thematic role reanalysis.

Abstract = {This paper proposes a diachronic analysis of the grammaticalization of a marker of negation into a yes/no question particle in Chinese. I propose that the input to the reanalysis was a vP-neg-vP disjunctive question in which the second vP was projected by a negative auxiliary. Head movement of this auxiliary to the head of an immediately dominating disjunction phrase allowed the negator to enter into an Agree relation with interrogative C and check the [Q] feature there. In time, the negator acquired the [uQ] feature originally on the disjunction. This allowed the negator to subsequently be base merged in C and function as a Q particle.

@article{2011-18808-00520111101,
Abstract = {It has been shown across several languages that verb inflection is difficult for agrammatic aphasic speakers. In particular, Tense inflection is vulnerable. Several theoretical accounts for this have been posed, for example, a pure syntactic one suggesting that the Tense node is unavailable due to its position in the syntactic tree (Friedmann & Grodzinsky, 1997); one suggesting that the interpretable features of the Tense node are underspecified (Burchert, Swoboda-Moll, & De Bleser, 2005; Wenzlaff & Clahsen, 2004, 2005); and a morphosemantic one, arguing that the diacritic Tense features are affected in agrammatism (Faroqi–Shah & Dickey, 2009; Lee, Milman, & Thompson, 2008). However recent findings (Bastiaanse, 2008) and a reanalysis of some oral production studies (e.g. Lee et al., 2008; Nanousi, Masterson, Druks, & Atkinson, 2006) suggest that both Tense and Aspect are impaired and, most importantly, reference to the past is selectively impaired, both through simple verb forms (such as simple past in English) and through periphrastic verb forms (such as the present perfect, ‘has V-ed’, in English). It will be argued that reference to the past is discourse linked and reference to the present and future is not (Zagona, 2003, in press). In-line with Avrutin’s (2000) theory that suggests discourse linking is impaired in Broca’s aphasia, the PAst DIscourse LInking Hypothesis (PADILIH) has been formulated. Three predictions were tested: (1) patients with agrammatic aphasia are selectively impaired in use of grammatical morphology associated with reference to the past, whereas, inflected forms which refer to the present and future are relatively spared; (2) this impairment is language-independent; and (3) this impairment will occur in both production and comprehension. Agrammatic Chinese, English and Turkish speakers were tested with the Test for Assessing Reference of Time (TART; Bastiaanse, Jonkers, & Thompson, unpublished). Results showed that both the English and Turkish agrammatic speakers performed as hypothesized, showing a selective deficit for production of inflected forms referring to the past, despite the typological difference between the languages. The Chinese agrammatic speakers were poor in reference to the past as well, but reference to the present and future also was severely impaired. For comprehension, the results were strikingly similar for the three languages: reference to the past was impaired for all. These results confirmed our hypothesis that reference to the past is discourse linked and, therefore, grammatical morphology used for reference to the past is impaired in agrammatic aphasia, whether this is done through Tense and/or Aspect markers.

Abstract = {We consider the estimation of probabilistic ranking models in the context of conjoint experiments. By using approximate rather than exact ranking probabilities, we avoided the computation of high-dimensional integrals. We extended the approximation technique proposed by Henery (1981) in the context of the Thurstone-Mosteller-Daniels model to any independent locally shifted random utility model. In particular, this allowed us to estimate any independent random utility model with common shape (e.g., normal, logistic) and scale. Moreover, our approach also allows for the analysis of any partial ranking. Partial rankings are essential in practical conjoint analysis to collect data efficiently to relieve respondents’ task burden. We applied the approach to the reanalysis of the career preference data set described in Maydeu-Olivares and Böckenholt (2005), and to a holiday preferences data set.

We propose to consider items as elements of a multivariate space, where DIF items are outlying elements. Following this approach, the situation of multiple groups is a quite natural case.

Here we suggest a number of rhythmic refinements for the application of the nPVI in musical contexts.

Abstract = {Discussions about the use of interviews in applied linguistics research have been ongoing in methods-oriented literature for some time. The focus of much of this discussion has concerned studies employing qualitative frameworks in which interviews are the primary method for generating data. However, there has been relatively little discussion of studies employing mixed methods—in which qualitative interviews are adopted as secondary or tertiary methods of data generation and are used in conjunction with conventionally quantitative measures. In this article I reconsider the assumptions informing my own analytic and representational practices as they relate to my use of interviews in a descriptive, mixed methods study of L2 lexical inferencing. Drawing on Talmy’s (2010) notion of interview as social practice, the notion of entextualization (Bauman and Briggs, 1990), and what Bamberg (2006) has referred to as small stories, I trace the process by which three instances of multiple and conflicting responses to questions concerning one participant’s ‘self-reported background information’ went unreported in that study. The reanalysis presents an opportunity to discuss compatibility between representational formats and data generation methods, important differences between theorization of interviews and participation in them, and the role of qualitative interviews in mixed methods research more generally.

Abstract = {The main argument against therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in psychiatry, which aims at helping the prescribing physician to optimize her/his pharmacotherapy is that "there is no dose–response relationship in psychiatry". We therefore posit that by basing the analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) on plasma levels rather than daily dose, one would considerably increase the statistical power of the data. The apparent discrepancies found can be reconciled in a unifying hypothesis that demands that the results of RCTs be based on plasma levels rather than daily dose and that a little data transformation is necessary to reveal the ligand–receptor interaction that the clinical effects of psychopharmacological medications are based on. To summarize, the apparent discrepancies detailed above can be reconciled in a unifying hypothesis that demands that the results of RCTs be based on plasma levels rather than daily dose and that a little data transformation is necessary to reveal the ligand–receptor interaction that the clinical effects of psychopharmacological medications are based on. For smaller patient samples, ROC analysis or analysis using a dichotomous variable have proven useful in that respect. Confounding variables, such as the presence of active metabolites and varying parent/metabolite ratios, as well as differences in p-glycoprotein engagement and consequently, differences in brain/plasma ratios among individual compounds will have to be addressed in future analyses, including a reanalysis of the inconclusive evidence regarding tricyclic antidepressants.

Abstract = {Aims: To provide 12-month prevalence and disability burden estimates of a broad range of mental and neurological disorders in the European Union (EU) and to compare these findings to previous estimates. Referring to our previous 2005 review, improved up-to-date data for the enlarged EU on a broader range of disorders than previously covered are needed for basic, clinical and public health research and policy decisions and to inform about the estimated number of persons affected in the EU. Method: Stepwise multi-method approach, consisting of systematic literature reviews, reanalyses of existing data sets, national surveys and expert consultations. Studies and data from all member states of the European Union (EU-27) plus Switzerland, Iceland and Norway were included. Supplementary information about neurological disorders is provided, although methodological constraints prohibited the derivation of overall prevalence estimates for mental and neurological disorders. Disease burden was measured by disability adjusted life years (DALY). Results: Prevalence: It is estimated that each year 38.2% of the EU population suffers from a mental disorder. Adjusted for age and comorbidity, this corresponds to 164.8 million persons affected. Compared to 2005 (27.4%) this higher estimate is entirely due to the inclusion of 14 new disorders also covering childhood/adolescence as well as the elderly. The estimated higher number of persons affected (2011: 165 m vs. 2005: 82 m) is due to coverage of childhood and old age populations, new disorders and of new EU membership states. The most frequent disorders are anxiety disorders (14.0%), insomnia (7.0%), major depression (6.9%), somatoform (6.3%), alcohol and drug dependence (<4%), ADHD (5%) in the young, and dementia (1–30%, depending on age). Except for substance use disorders and mental retardation, there were no substantial cultural or country variations. Although many sources, including national health insurance programs, reveal increases in sick leave, early retirement and treatment rates due to mental disorders, rates in the community have not increased with a few exceptions (i.e. dementia). There were also no consistent indications of improvements with regard to low treatment rates, delayed treatment provision and grossly inadequate treatment. Disability: Disorders of the brain and mental disorders in particular, contribute 26.6% of the total all cause burden, thus a greater proportion as compared to other regions of the world. The rank order of the most disabling diseases differs markedly by gender and age group; overall, the four most disabling single conditions were: depression, dementias, alcohol use disorders and stroke. Conclusion: In every year over a third of the total EU population suffers from mental disorders. The true size of “disorders of the brain” including neurological disorders is even considerably larger. Disorders of the brain are the largest contributor to the all cause morbidity burden as measured by DALY in the EU. No indications for increasing overall rates of mental disorders were found nor of improved care and treatment since 2005; less than one third of all cases receive any treatment, suggesting a considerable level of unmet needs. We conclude that the true size and burden of disorders of the brain in the EU was significantly underestimated in the past. Concerted priority action is needed at all levels, including substantially increased funding for basic, clinical and public health research in order to identify better strategies for improved prevention and treatment for disorders of the brain as the core health challenge of the 21st century.

Abstract = {Sensory experience rating (SER), a new variable motivated by the grounded cognition framework of conceptual processing (e.g., Barsalou, 2008), indexes the degree to which a word evokes sensory/perceptual experiences. In the present study, SERs were collected for over 2,850 words. While SER is correlated with imageability, age of acquisition, and word frequency, the latter variables (along with seven others) account for less than 30% of the variance in SER. Reanalyses of two large-scale studies demonstrate that SER significantly predicts lexical decision times when other established predictor variables are statistically controlled. These results suggest that conceptual processing is grounded in sensory systems. Additionally, a major benefit of this variable is that it allows psycholinguistic researchers to examine semantic–perceptual links for all word classes with a single rating.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Life histories of the Dobe !Kung: Food, fatness, and well-being over the life-span by Nancy Howell’s (2010). This well-written book describes reanalysis of existing anthropometric and behavioral data on the !Kung of northern Botswana, the same data that previously underpinned Howell’s classic and much admired volume, The Demography of the Dobe !Kung. Since that book was published, increasing interest has been directed to analyzing the life history profiles of various foraging populations. On both counts, this very generous book is an elegant guide that shows how seemingly simple anthropometric and dietary data can be used to tease out answers to fundamental questions in human ecology and life history. Howell’s particular interest is in understanding how the nutritional status of the Dobe !Kung population correlates with energy capture from the environment and, in particular, who funds the expensive growth costs of children who, until adulthood, invariably consume more calories than they produce. Howell takes the reader carefully through both theoretical issues, and the limitations of her data, and she addresses a series of related questions so the reader steadily gains expertise in the process. She also incorporates much valuable ethnographic material, and her work doubtless benefits from the insights gained from other researchers who conducted fieldwork at the same time. Her clarity makes this a very rewarding book, and both her approach and her findings are likely to prove very stimulating to the field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Analysis of the health care utilisation of migrants with mental disorders compared to Germans with mental disorders under consideration of migration-related and socio-economic factors. Methods: Reanalysis of the supplement survey “Mental Disorders” of the “German Health Survey” 1998 with a matched sample of migrants (n = 151) and Germans (n = 151) with a positive 12-month prevalence of mental disorders. Results: Regarding the prevalence rates for mental disorders and health care utilisation no differences in the sample between Germans and migrants could be found. Conclusions: The migration background alone does not explain the differences in health care utilisation which are found in many studies. It is assumed, that differences arise multifactorial, and can be explained through migration-related factors but especially through socio-economic factors. To provide a better understanding of health care utilisation of migrants it might be necessary to set the focus on socio-economic factors. In addition a differentiated measurement of cultural and migration-related factors is needed in future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {M. Carrasco and B. McElree (2001) presented a speed–accuracy trade-off experiment, investigating covert attention in visual search. One of the conclusions from Carrasco and McElree was that adding distractors to a single feature search does not decrease the speed with which information is accumulated about target identity. We present a reanalysis of the relevant data from Carrasco and McElree in which we demonstrate that their conclusion was incomplete and we demonstrate a processing speed advantage for single feature search displays with no distractors compared with displays with distractors. This finding is confirmed in a new speed–accuracy trade-off experiment presented here. Further, we demonstrate that increasing the display duration increases the processing speed of displays with distractors but not for displays without distractors. We discuss these results in relation to theories of visual attention and the debate between graded and fixed architecture accounts for attentional allocation.

Abstract = {The German “bekommen-passive” is a recipient passive construction that is generally considered to be a case of “grammaticalization-in-progress”. It emerges on the basis of constructional ambiguity: In a bracket structure with a finite form of the verbs bekommen or kriegen (‘to get’, ‘to receive’) and a past participle in sentence-final position, the get-verb can be reanalyzed as a passive auxiliary, when certain structural and semantic conditions are met. The new recipient passive construction is very productive, and its use is even extended to two-place verbs, where a very abstract notion of benefaction or malefaction is possible. The article will analyze the structural and semantic properties of the construction in a range of data and in correlation with the ongoing grammaticalization process of the construction. Also, the particular structural features of German that serve as a starting point for the reanalysis of this construction will be described. The semantics of the construction will be described on the basis of semantic classes of ditransitive structures, as suggested by Leirbukt 1997 and Goldberg 1995. It will be argued that there is a potentially wide-ranging semantic productivity with a construction, once it is established. Descriptions in terms of a form-function correlation are useful to capture a certain tendency in the meaning, but they should not exclude some potential flexibility with respect to the situation of use. The motivation for the development of the German bekommen-passive will be outlined with respect to findings and considerations from functional syntactic theories. Evidence from two corpus studies will be discussed to show that the general syntactic-pragmatic principle, that topics tend to become subjects cross-linguistically, motivates the emergence and distribution of the bekommen-passive construction.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Woman's Unconscious Use of Her Body: A Psychoanalytic Perspective by Dinora Pines (see record [rid]2010-08279-000[/rid]). The sequence of papers contained in the book reflects the course of Pines's own personal and professional life. When she was starting out as a dermatologist, she saw vividly how one's skin, which is a primal agency of communicating both merger and separation (like the experiences of pregnancy and birth that were to intrigue her during the later stages of her career), can physically communicate emotions that cannot yet be conveyed verbally. Author expands her ideas about communication via skin appearance by describing her reanalysis of a woman who had been compliant and imitative of the analyst during her first analysis. The relief that she obtained from her depression, suicidal inclinations, and intermittent psychosis during that analysis disappeared when that first analyst left the country. Author stresses the way in which unresolved preoedipal fantasies and conflicts can create serious problems in relation to pregnancy and childbirth. Author makes the important point that she has repeatedly had to be willing to literally feel her patients' excruciating pain in order to verify the reality of their experiences for them, and only then is she able to put things into words for them—to enable them to do this for themselves.

Abstract = {This paper describes the humor of Deaf communities, arguing that the humor is related primarily to the dominant visual experience of Deaf people, but also influenced by their knowledge of humor traditions in the hearing society at large. Sign language humor in America and Britain may be seen in the creation of new visual signs, the witty reanalysis of existing signs and in bilingual games in which English is manipulated within sign languages. The content of Deaf humor supports the in-group of community members who embrace their signing collective Deaf identity and denigrates out-group people, including deaf people who do not belong to the community and hearing people who are often seen as a threat to the community. Many of these jokes also make reference to sign language. We conclude that the visual nature of Deaf humor is one of its key characteristics and ask what else this can tell us about the Deaf cultural way of interacting with and presenting the world.

Abstract = {Purpose: Traditionally, the voices of service users have been silent in research into mental health issues. A Norwegian research network, however, recognizes the importance of involving service users as coresearchers and initiated a training program in research methodology and design intended to empower them as active participants in research projects. In this article, we explore how these coresearchers with a mental health service user background experience their participation in projects as well as in attending the training: What is it like being a service user coresearcher in collaborative studies on issues in mental health? How do coresearchers negotiate their roles and mandate? Method: We used focus groups as our data collection method, transcribed the group discussions verbatim, and analyzed the transcriptions using qualitative methodology. We then took the preliminary analyses back to the participants for discussion, auditing, and reanalysis. Results: We identified themes that represent important social processes around which the participants developed a consensual understanding: self-definition, constructive differentiation and negotiations. Conclusion: Our findings generate hypotheses on how participatory research into mental health issues can be fruitfully organized, in a way that empowers service users to active and constructive participation.

Abstract = {In French, a causal relation is often conveyed by the connectives car, parce que or puisque. Since the seminal work of the Lambda-l Group (1975), it has generally been assumed that parce que, used to relate semantic content, contrasts with car and puisque, both used to connect either speech act or epistemic content. However, this analysis leaves a number of questions unanswered. In this paper, I present a reanalysis of this trio, using empirical methods such as corpus analysis and constrained elicitation. Results indicate that car and parce que are interchangeable in many contexts, even if they are still prototypically used in their respective domain in writing. As for puisque, its distribution does not overlap with car, despite their similar domains of use. I argue that the specificity of puisque with respect to the other two connectives is to introduce a cause with an echoic meaning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {To clarify the time course over which the human brain processes information about durations up to ∼300 ms, we reanalyzed the data that were previously reported by Mitsudo et al. (2009) using a multivariate analysis method. Event-related potentials were recorded from 19 scalp electrodes on 11 (nine original and two additional) participants while they judged whether two neighboring empty time intervals—called t1 and t2 and marked by three tone bursts—had equal durations. There was also a control condition in which the participants were presented the same temporal patterns but without a judgment task. In the present reanalysis,we sought to visualize how the temporal patterns were represented in the brain over time. A correlation matrix across channels was calculated for each temporal pattern. Geometric separations between the correlation matrices were calculated, and subjected to multidimensional scaling. We performed such analyses for a moving 100-ms time window after the t1 presentations. In the windows centered at <100ms after the t2 presentation, the analyses revealed the local maxima of categorical separation between temporal patterns of perceptually equal durations versus perceptually unequal durations, both in the judgment condition and in the control condition. Such categorization of the temporal patterns was prominent only in narrow temporal regions. The analysis indicated that the participants determined whether the two neighboring time intervals were of equal duration mostly within 100ms after the presentation of the temporal patterns. A very fast brain activity was related to the perception of elementary temporal patterns without explicit judgments. This is consistent with the findings of Mitsudo et al. and it is in line with the processing time hypothesis proposed by Nakajima et al. (2004). The validity of the correlation matrix analyses turned out to be an effective tool to grasp the overall responses of the brain to temporal patterns.

Abstract = {Objective: To reanalyze data from a 2002 study by the Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group to determine whether patients who believed they were receiving active therapy rather than placebo obtained greater improvement, independent of treatment. Method: Three hundred forty adults with major depressive disorder (according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) and baseline scores of ≥ 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) were randomized to Hypericum perforatum 900-1,500 mg/d, sertraline 50-100 mg/d, or placebo and were asked to guess their assigned treatment after 8 weeks. This reanalysis of data was performed from October 1, 2009, to April 15, 2011. The intent-to-treat sample included 207 subjects (mean age = 44 years) who had (1) at least 1 postbaseline visit; (2) adherence data based on serum levels of hyperforin, sertraline, and desmethylsertraline; and (3) guess data. Univariate factorial analysis of variance was used to determine whether treatment assignment affected clinical improvement according to HDRS-17 score and whether this effect was moderated by patient guess of sertraline, Hypericum, or placebo. Analysis of covariance was used to determine whether side effects mediated improvement in the context of patient guess and assigned treatment. χ₂ analyses compared response rates (≥ 50% decrease in HDRS-17 score) between the guess groups and between the treatment groups within each guess group. Results: Assigned treatment had no significant effect on clinical improvement (P = .65), but patient guess was significantly associated with improvement (P < .001), and treatment and guess interacted significantly (P = .005). Among subjects who guessed placebo, clinical improvement was small and did not differ significantly across treatments. Among subjects who guessed Hypericum, improvement was large and did not differ significantly across treatments. Among subjects who guessed sertraline, those who received placebo or sertraline had large improvements, but those who received Hypericum had significantly less improvement (P < .001). Similar findings were obtained for response rates. Conclusions: Patient beliefs regarding treatment may have a stronger association with clinical outcome than the actual medication received, and the strength of this association may depend upon the particular combination of treatment guessed and treatment received.

Abstract = {Despite the central position of CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampal circuit, the experimental investigation of their synaptic properties has been limited. Recent slice experiments from adult rats characterized AMPA and NMDA receptor unitary synaptic responses in CA3b pyramidal cells. Here, excitatory synaptic activation is modeled to infer biophysical parameters, aid analysis interpretation, explore mechanisms, and formulate predictions by contrasting simulated somatic recordings with experimental data. Reconstructed CA3b pyramidal cells from the public repository NeuroMorpho.Org were used to allow for cell-specific morphological variation. For each cell, synaptic responses were simulated for perforant pathway and associational/commissural synapses. Means and variability for peak amplitude, time-to-peak, and half-height width in these responses were compared with equivalent statistics from experimental recordings. Synaptic responses mediated by AMPA receptors are best fit with properties typical of previously characterized glutamatergic receptors where perforant path synapses have conductances twice that of associational/commissural synapses (0.9 vs. 0.5 nS) and more rapid peak times (1.0 vs. 3.3 ms). Reanalysis of passive-cell experimental traces using the model shows no evidence of a CA1-like increase of associational/commissural AMPA receptor conductance with increasing distance from the soma. Synaptic responses mediated by NMDA receptors are best fit with rapid kinetics, suggestive of NR2A subunits as expected in mature animals. Predictions were made for passive-cell current clamp recordings, combined AMPA and NMDA receptor responses, and local dendritic depolarization in response to unitary stimulations. Models of synaptic responses in active cells suggest altered axial resistivity and the presence of synaptically activated potassium channels in spines.

Abstract = {Objective: This study involves a reanalysis of data from a randomized controlled trial to examine whether child–parent psychotherapy (CPP), an empirically based treatment focusing on the parent–child relationship as the vehicle for child improvement, is efficacious for children who experienced multiple traumatic and stressful life events (TSEs). Methods: Participants comprised 75 preschool-aged children and their mothers referred to treatment following the child’s exposure to domestic violence. Dyads were randomly assigned to CPP or to a comparison group that received monthly case management plus referrals to community services and were assessed at intake, posttest, and 6-month follow-up. Treatment effectiveness was examined by level of child TSE risk exposure (<4 risks versus 4+ TSEs). Results: For children in the 4+ risk group, those who received CPP showed significantly greater improvements in PTSD and depression symptoms, PTSD diagnosis, number of co-occurring diagnoses, and behavior problems compared to those in the comparison group. CPP children with <4 risks showed greater improvements in symptoms of PTSD than those in the comparison group. Mothers of children with 4+ TSEs in the CPP group showed greater reductions in symptoms of PTSD and depression than those randomized to the comparison condition. Analyses of 6-month follow-up data suggest improvements were maintained for the high risk group. Conclusions: The data provide evidence that CPP is effective in improving outcomes for children who experienced four or more TSEs and had positive effects for their mothers as well. Practice implications: Numerous studies show that exposure to childhood trauma and adversity has negative consequences for later physical and mental health, but few interventions have been specifically evaluated to determine their effectiveness for children who experienced multiple TSEs. The findings suggest that including the parent as an integral participant in the child’s treatment may be particularly effective in the treatment of young children exposed to multiple risks.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Fermín Moscoso del Prado Martín (see record [rid]2011-14317-002[/rid]). Moscoso del Prado Martín (2011) reported reanalyses of data from the English Lexicon Project . Contrary to his claims, his results actually provide further evidence in favor of the pervasive hypothesis. ELP word naming latencies and durations both exhibit 1 ⁄ f scaling, directly parallel to the RT and duration results found by Kello et al. (2007). Both ELP measures exhibited 1 ⁄ f scaling, and a generalization of transfer entropy (TE) was formulated that yielded two causally distinct sources of 1 ⁄ f scaling (error rates also exhibited 1 ⁄ f scaling, but not distinct from RTs and durations). The TE analysis measures predictive power among time series variables, that is, the degree to which past information about one variable predicts future values of another. Moscoso del Prado Martín (2011) also applied his method to the Kello et al. (2008) speech data and found an estimated 10–12 causally distinct sources of 1 ⁄ f scaling (given a priori hypotheses that narrowed down the set of causal relations tested). Thus, the estimated number of causally distinct sources of 1 ⁄ f scaling is lower than the estimated number of linearly separable sources. Finally, as a mechanism that might yield pervasive 1 ⁄ f scaling, the random walk plus negative feedback mechanism is different than the one motivating our work.

Abstract = {This article presents the study of grammaticalization within the fields of language change and variation, and historical linguistics. Grammaticalization has to do with the diachronic relationship between the lexicon and grammar and with stages of relatively greater and lesser grammaticality. The major effects of grammaticalization, e.g. phonological reduction, semantic generalization, and fusion (or bondedness) are reviewed. The various roles that reanalysis, analogy, and frequency play in grammaticalization are also discussed. The paper further presents the role that grammaticalization studies has played in establishing diachronic universals and discusses metaphor and metonymy in motivating those universals. Finally, the controversies concerning the exceptional status of grammaticalization, the unidirectionality hypothesis, and the legitimacy of grammaticalization as ‘process’ and ‘theory’ are addressed.

Abstract = {This study presents and analyzes the comprehension of relative clauses in child and adult speakers of Russian, comparing monolingual controls with Russian heritage speakers (HSs) who are Englishdominant. Monolingual and bilingual children demonstrate full adultlike mastery of relative clauses. Adult HSs, however, are significantly different from the monolingual adult controls and from the child HS group. This divergent performance indicates that the adult heritage grammar is not a product of the fossiJization of child language. Instead, it suggests that forms existing in the baseline undergo gradual attrition over the life span of a HS. This result is consistent with observations on narrative structure in child and adult HSs (Polinsky, 2008b). Evidence from word order facts suggests that relative clause reanalysis in adult HSs cannot be attributed to transfer from English. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Swets, Tanner Jr., and Birdsall (1961) proposed a 4-alternative forced-choice task with two choices (4AFC-2R) for distinguishing between the Equal-Variance Signal Detection model and the One-High Threshold model. This task was recently implemented in the field of recognition memory (Parks & Yonelinas, 2009), a field in which several candidate models have been proposed. One advantage of the 4AFC-2R task is that it permits parameter estimation and goodness of fit testing, something which so far was only possible through the use of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) functions for the more complex candidate models. The present article provides a thorough characterization and comparison of the main recognition memory models in the context of this task. Results are illustrated by a reanalysis of Parks and Yonelinas’ original data, revealing a preference for hybrid approaches to recognition memory, more specifically for the dual-process model (Yonelinas, 1997), whereas pure signal detection models performed poorly. The present analysis provides an assessment of the merits and limitations of this task, highlighting future research applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: This review explores whether smoking prevalence in addiction treatment samples exceeds that shown in epidemiological data for persons with alcohol or other drug use disorders and whether smoking may have decreased over time in the addiction treatment population as it has done in the general population. Methods: English language papers published between 1987 and 2009 were searched electronically. Forty papers reporting smoking prevalence for addiction treatment samples in the United States were identified, and key predictor variables were abstracted. Random logistic models were used to assess relationships between each individual predictor (year, treatment modality, primary drug treated, government status, and public/private funding status) and smoking prevalence. Results: The lowest smoking prevalence aggregated for studies reported in any single year was 65%, well above epidemiological estimates reported among those with alcohol use and drug use disorders. The odds of smoking were higher in methadone maintenance programs (odds ratio [OR] = 2.25, CI = 1.08, 4.68) as compared with outpatient programs. No other variables in the model were significant. Reanalysis omitting recent studies that may represent outliers or confounding with type of treatment showed a small but significant decrease in smoking over time (OR = 0.9891, CI = 0.9888, 0.9893). Conclusions: The very high smoking rates reported in addiction treatment samples warrant significant, organized, and systemic response from addiction treatment systems, from agencies that fund and regulate those systems, and from agencies concerned with tobacco control.

Abstract = {Despite a growing body of neuroimaging data, little consensus has been reached regarding the neural correlates of temporal processing in humans. This paper presents a reanalysis of two previously published neuroimaging experiments, which used two different cognitive timing tasks and examined both sub- and supra-second intervals. By processing these data in an identical manner, this reanalysis allows valid comparison and contrasting across studies. Conjunction of these studies using inclusive masking reveals shared activity in right hemispheric dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, supporting a general-purpose system for cognitive time measurement in the right hemispheric prefrontal cortex. Consideration of the patterns of activity in each dataset with respect to the others, and taking task characteristics into account, provides insight into the possible role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in working memory and of posterior parietal cortex and anterior cingulate in attentional processing during cognitive time measurement tasks.

Abstract = {This paper proposes an explanation for the rise and fall of a 1PL imperative ending in the dialect of Mesocco, a Northern Italo-Romance variety from southern Switzerland. This ending cannot be explained with inherited 1PL morphology: rather, it is best accounted for by assuming the reanalysis of a 2PL imperative hosting a 1SG pronominal object clitic. This reanalysis, it is suggested, must have occurred in the syntactic context provided by the 'ethical' dative construction. It has been prompted by several factors, among which the crucial one is functional in nature, viz the pragmatic homology between 1PL imperative - unmarkedly inclusive in meaning - and the ethical dative construction with a 2PL imperative. Comparative evidence is also adduced from studies in linguistic typology, showing that similar crossovers between 1st and 2nd person plural morphology, although unattested in Romance (or, more precisely, in the better-known standard Romance languages), are not without parallels cross-linguistically. Finally, a functional motivation is provided for the deacquisition of this 1PL imperative form in the dialect of the younger generations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Presents a case report of Auguste Deter, a middle aged woman in whom Alois Alzheimer was first reported. The patient came to Alzheimer’s attention when she was admitted to his psychiatric service at age 51 years, because of substantial forgetfulness accompanied by hallucinations. Dementia progressed rapidly and she died 5 years later, in 1906, at age 56 years. Neuropathological analysis of her cerebral cortex revealed many amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Originally, the term Alzheimer’s disease referred to presenile dementia as reported by Alzheimer in Auguste Deter and in another patient. Both the patient records of Auguste Deter and the histological slides prepared from her brain in Alzheimer’s laboratory have been rediscovered. Neuropathological reanalysis confirmed the original diagnosis. Because mutations in PSEN1 are the most common cause of autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease, the authors analyzed PSEN1 in DNA extracted from a histological section of Auguste Deter’s brain. In summary, the PSEN1 mutation in Auguste Deter is consistent with the clinical findings and uncovers the cause of disease in this important historical case.

The conclusion drawn by the author in his reanalysis of data from the original study which yielded evidence consistent with a labeled line model of the functional organisation of frontal cortex, can not be supported with the analyses that he describes. This is because his method does not take into account the temporal dependencies of the theoretically discrete processes engaged by the behavioural task that produced the data. That author's analysis may not be appropriate for a reanalysis of the data from Postle et al (2000) is foreshadowed by his statement in the Introduction, that fMRI time courses "are analogous to event-related potential scalp voltage timecourses". This would seem to overlook a critical difference between the two; the latter arises directly from neural activity whereas the former is a lowpass-filtered (i.e., "smeared out") transform of this activity. One consequence of this difference is that simply plucking a time point from an fMRI time course does not yield a "clean," or "process-pure" datum.

Abstract = {Five studies have examined the relationship between sexual orientation and the relative lengths of the 2nd and 4th fingers (the 2D:4D ratio). Although differences have commonly been found between heterosexuals and homosexuals, the direction of the difference has not been consistent across studies. The original data from all five studies were reanalyzed in a search for possible explanations of the discrepancies. Because ethnicity is known to affect the 2D:4D ratio, the reanalysis focused on participants who identified themselves as White or Caucasian, the ethnic group that was most numerous in all of the studies. Age differences did not account for the discrepancies. Differences in variability within different groups were minor. One interesting result to emerge from the reanalysis was that the 2D:4D ratios for the homosexual groups were relatively similar across studies. It was the 2D:4D values for the heterosexual participants that varied most, particularly between the USA and the British studies, and these were responsible for many of the discrepancies in the conclusions across studies. The constancy of the 2D:4D ratio for the White homosexuals did not appear to extend to homosexuals of three other ethnicities, and there were also subpopulation differences related to right or left hands.

Abstract = {Previous attempts to elucidate the dimensional structure of personality disorders (PDs) have been based on single samples and measures. Like one-item tests, they are useful but scattered and potentially misleading glimpses at the true structure of PDs. Therefore, reanalyses of 33 previously published data sets were conducted using recommended statistical procedures to arrive at consensus structures. Similar reanalyses of published data were conducted on associations between PDs and the five-factor model of normal personality characteristics. High degrees of congruence were observed between the consensus PD structures and the consensus structures suggested by dimensions of normal personality. The analytic techniques used in the present study helped bypass methodological problems inherent in previous tests and revealed higher levels of support for both theoretically and empirically based representations of the five-factor model approach to PDs.

Abstract = {In a recent positron emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated the ability to measure amphetamine-induced dopamine (DA) release in the human cortex with the DA D2/3 radioligand [¹¹C]FLB 457. As previous studies in animals have shown that a relatively high fraction of the [¹¹C]FLB 457 signal in the cerebellum represents specific binding to D2/3 receptors, there was concern that the use of the cerebellum as a measure of nonspecific binding (i.e., reference region) to derive [¹¹C]FLB 457 binding potential (BP) (BPND) would bias cortical DA release measurements. Thus, we evaluated the fractional contribution of specific binding to D2/3 receptors in the human cerebellum for [¹¹C]FLB 457. Six healthy human subjects (5M/1F) were studied twice with [¹¹C]FLB 457, once at baseline and again following a single oral dose of 15 mg of aripiprazole, a D2/3 partial agonist. [¹¹C]FLB 457 distribution volume (VT) was estimated using kinetic analysis in the cortical regions of interest and potential reference regions. The change in [¹¹C]FLB 457 VT following aripiprazole ranged from −33 to −42% in the cortical regions of interest (ROIs). The aripiprazole-induced change in [¹¹C]FLB 457 VT in three potential reference regions suggests significant specific binding the cerebellum (CER, –17 ± 12%), but not pons (PON, –10 ± 10%) and centrum semiovale (CESVL, –3 ± 12%). Nevertheless, a reanalysis of the published [¹¹C]FLB 457 test–retest and amphetamine studies suggests that the use of the PON VT and CESVL VT as an estimate of nonspecific binding to derive [¹¹C]FLB 457 BPND in DA release studies is unlikely to be successful because it leads to less reproducible outcome measures, which in turn diminishes the ability to measure DA release in the cortex. D2/3 blocking studies with aripiprazole and [¹¹C]FLB 457 suggest specific binding to D2/3 receptors in the cerebellum. These data also suggest that the contribution of specific binding to D2/3 receptors in the cerebellum is lower than that in the cortical ROIs and that CER VT is mostly representative of nonspecific binding. Nevertheless, caution is advised when using reference tissue methods that rely solely on the cerebellum signal as an input function to quantify [¹¹C]FLB 457 BPND.

Abstract = {This study explored the somatotopy of the motor areas of the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere, in the human brain. In a sample of 16 healthy participants, we drew 9 regions of interest (ROI) over the primary motor area (M1), each corresponding to a well-known somatic representation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the resting state functional connectivity between each selected ROI and the motor areas of the medial wall. The main finding was the identification of a rostrocaudal gradient of connectivity in which the more we move from cranial to caudal body representation areas in M1, the more the corresponding connected area in the medial wall is shifted rostrocaudally, confirming the somatotopic schema found in the SMA. We also reanalyzed data obtained in a previous experiment, we performed using hand and foot motor tasks; the reanalysis consisted in traditional BOLD and functional connectivity analyses. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of 28 studies of hand and foot motor tasks, mapping their cerebral representations using the tools provided by the Brainmap database. All data converge in confirming a somatotopic representation of the medial wall motor areas, with hand representation placed more rostrally and ventrally than that of the foot.

Abstract = {Several articles have recently questioned the distinction between acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and traditional cognitive therapy (CT). This study presents a reanalysis of data from Zettle and Rains that compared 12 weeks of group CT with group ACT. For theoretical reasons, Zettle and Rains also included a modified form of CT that did not include distancing, and no intent-to-treat analysis was included. Particularly because that unusual third condition did somewhat better than the full CT package, it contaminated the direct comparison of ACT and CT, which has of late become theoretically interesting. In the present study, data from participants in the ACT and CT conditions were reanalyzed. ACT was shown to produce greater reductions in levels of self-reported depression using an intent-to-treat analysis. Posttreatment levels of cognitive defusion mediated this effect at follow-up. The occurrence of depressogenic thoughts and level of dysfunctional attitudes did not function as mediators. This study adds additional evidence that ACT works through distinct and theoretically specified processes that are not the same as CT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The present study addresses the question of whether case and verb agreement are cross linguistically equivalent during sentence processing. This question is addressed by exploring the brain mechanisms involved in processing Basque, a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) head-final language with ergative alignment, case morphology and multiple verb agreement. Basque speakers’ ERPs were recorded during an auditory grammatical judgment task. Participants were presented with correct and incorrect sentences addressed to study ergative case and subject and object verb-agreement processing. Incorrect sentences elicited, in all cases, a P600 component, an ERP effect repeatedly reported in previous studies that explored syntactic violations similar to the present ones, although in nominative languages. The results of this study show comparable ERP responses to both subject and object agreement and indicate that specific features of agreement (number versus person) have distinct ERP correlates, at least for multiple verb agreement. In addition, the ERP signatures for the ergative case violation were comparable to the ones found by previous studies on nominative case. Overall, the present study shows that the repair and reanalysis processes involved in verb agreement and case violations are sustained by equivalent neural mechanisms across language types.

Abstract = {While it is widely acknowledged in the formal semantic literature that both the truth-functional focus particle only and it-clefts convey exhaustiveness, the nature and source of exhaustiveness effects with it-clefts remain contested. We describe a questionnaire study (n = 80) and an event-related brain potentials (ERP) study (n = 16) that investigated the violation of exhaustiveness in German only-foci versus it-clefts. The offline study showed that a violation of exhaustivity with only is less acceptable than the violation with it-clefts, suggesting a difference in the nature of exhaustivity interpretation in the two environments. The ERP-results confirm that this difference can be seen in online processing as well: a violation of exhaustiveness in only-foci elicited a centro-posterior positivity (600–800ms), whereas a violation in it-clefts induced a globally distributed N400 pattern (400–600ms). The positivity can be interpreted as a reanalysis process and more generally as a process of context updating. The N400 effect in it-clefts is interpreted as indexing a cancelation process that is functionally distinct from the only case. The ERP study is, to our knowledge, the first evidence from an online experimental paradigm which shows that the violation of exhaustiveness involves different underlying processes in the two structural environments.

Abstract = {Three experiments examined the influence of first lexeme morphological family size on English compound word recognition. Concatenated compound words whose first lexemes were from large morphological families were responded to faster in word naming and lexical decision than compounds from small morphological families. In addition, an eye movement experiment showed that gaze durations were shorter on compounds from large morphological families during sentence reading. This was mainly due to more refixations on compounds from small morphological families. Posthoc analyses and reanalysis of past studies suggested that compounds with a larger number of higher frequency family members (HFFM) are read more slowly than compounds with fewer HFFM. Thus, while morphological family size is generally facilitative, the presence of HFFM has an inhibitory effect on eye movement behaviour. The time-course of these effects is discussed.

Abstract = {Deteriorated phonological representations are widely assumed to be the underlying cause of reading difficulties in developmental dyslexia; however, existing evidence also implicates degraded orthographic processing. Here, we used event-related potentials whilst dyslexic and control adults performed a pseudoword-word priming task requiring deep phonological analysis to examine phonological and orthographic priming, respectively. Pseudowords were manipulated to be homophonic or non-homophonic to a target word and more or less orthographically similar. Since previous ERP research with normal readers has established phonologically driven differences as early as 250 ms from word presentation, degraded phonological representations were expected to reveal reduced phonological priming in dyslexic readers from 250 ms after target word onset. However, phonological priming main effects in both the N2 and P3 ranges were indistinguishable in amplitude between groups. Critically, we found group differences in the N1 range, such that orthographic modulations observed in controls were absent in the dyslexic group. Furthermore, early group differences in phonological priming transpired as interactions with orthographic priming (in P2, N2 and P3 ranges). A group difference in phonological priming did not emerge until the P600 range, in which the dyslexic group showed significantly attenuated priming. As the P600 is classically associated with online monitoring and reanalysis, this pattern of results suggest that during deliberate phonological processing, the phonological deficit in reading may relate more to inefficient monitoring rather than deficient detection. Meanwhile, early differences in perceptual processing of phonological information may be driven by the strength of engagement with orthographic information.

Abstract = {Visual search involves a subtle coordination of visual memory and lower-order perceptual mechanisms. Specifically, the fluctuations in gaze may provide support for visual search above and beyond what may be attributed to memory. Prior research indicates that gaze during search exhibits fractal fluctuations, which allow for a wide sampling of the field of view. Fractal fluctuations constitute a case of fast diffusion that may provide an advantage in exploration. We present reanalyses of eye-tracking data collected by Stephen and Mirman (Cognition, 115, 154–165, 2010) for single-feature and conjunction search tasks. Fluctuations in gaze during these search tasks were indeed fractal. Furthermore, the degree of fractality predicted decreases in reaction time on a trial-by-trial basis. We propose that fractality may play a key role in explaining the efficacy of perceptual exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

First of all, it was impossible to fit a GFP model to the personality data without setting the error variance associated with Extraversion to zero and thus aligning it exclusively with Extraversion. Second, in the full model, which included likeability and popularity, a model without GFP showed a better fit than the Van der Linden et al. (2010) GFP model. Third, when entered together with Extraversion, the GFP did not add any additional variance in likeability and even acted as an suppressor variable of the relation between Extraversion and popularity.

The authors argue that additive controls and dropping irrelevant dyads constitute misspecifications of their effects. There are theoretical reasons to believe that the impact of distance on conflict is not sufficiently severe to justify the practice of simply dropping irrelevant dyads. Moreover, they argue that political irrelevance and dyadic democracy, rather than subtracting some constant quantity, interact to impose an upper bound on the probability of conflict initiation. They find both of these arguments to be supported in a reanalysis of a prominent study of dispute initiation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This article addresses a paradox surrounding psychosocial maturity and self-actualizing in relation to well-being. Several stage theories of maturity (notably ego development; Loevinger, 1976) culminate in self-actualizing, which Maslow (1968) characterizes as the pinnacle of psychological health and well-being. However, empirical measures of maturity and well-being do not correlate. In a reanalysis of three datasets, we find preliminary support for the notion that people scoring at the highest stage of Loevinger’s ego development might have higher levels of well-being and narrate a more growth-focused self-identity than people scoring at all other stages. Drawing on Erikson’s (1959/1994) claim that the acceptance of life’s complexities underlies ego integrity, we attempt to provide a theoretical explanation for how well-being might emerge normatively at the highest stage of psychosocial maturity.

The author seeks to draw together work on acquisition and change, an enterprise that I endorse strongly: "Findings from diachronic studies put issues on the research agenda of acquisition studies". However, he argues here that "language acquisition in multilingual settings may be a more plausible source of grammatical reanalysis than monolingual first language development" and works with the third, Ethnologue view of languages; all of his examples concern speakers of languages like "German" interacting with speakers of "Turkish", etc. The author's paper is full of references to "transmission failure", "unsuccessful acquisition", "incomplete acquisition", "acquisition failure", and even "the wrong grammar", but such phrases refer to children acquiring different grammars from somebody else and there is nothing wrong or unsuccessful and no failure. The author has no basis for denying that new grammars may emerge under other circumstances and offers no reason not to take a broader view of what is meant by languages. Indeed, when English developed a new set of inflectional elements, so-called modal auxiliaries that are not verbs, it wasn't because another influential language had them; they were a unique innovation in English with no parallel in any European language.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Jürgen M. Meisel (see record [rid]2011-09609-001[/rid]). We applaud the author's tackling the fundamental questions of learnability as they arise in the context of Bilingual first language acquisition (BFLA), and specifically the issue of when and how "acquisition failure" can occur. The debate over the status of unbalanced BFLA is, in any case, tangential to the author's research question. The argument that unbalanced BFLA is not a form of second language acquisition leads the author to conclude that "cases of bilingual development where one language is weaker than the other do not seem to be prone to lead to transmission failures of the sort which might explain reanalysis in diachronic change". But the validity of this conclusion depends on whether there is cross-linguistic influence between the child's developing grammars. The author's perspective on the role of BFLA in grammatical change is limited by the assumption of a theoretical model which excludes from the outset much of contact-induced change. Nonetheless, the author has moved the debate forward by distinguishing the logic of the arguments with respect to each type of bilingualism, and formulating the issues clearly and forcefully.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Jürgen M. Meisel (see record [rid]2011-09609-001[/rid]). The article is literally thought-provoking, especially for the issues that one can raise out of the central position that he develops, viz., "although bilingual acquisition in situations of language contact can be argued to be of significant importance for explanations of grammatical change, reanalysis affecting parameter settings is much less likely to happen than is commonly assumed in historical linguistics". As in much of the linguistics literature, the author uses the terms transmission and acquisition in a Saussurean way, with language being an institution that native speakers would preserve intact if it were not for nonnative speakers who acquire it imperfectly, under the influence of the languages they have acquired previously. Conversely, in ideal conditions, children would acquire their parents' systems faithfully, just like biological offspring are believed to inherit the biological characteristics of their parents. Overall, the article has the merit of prompting us to think harder on the causes, or to use Hickey's term, "motives", of language change qua system reorganization. I believe he has provided only part of the answer but not the fundamental one, which lies in the fact that language acquisition is reconstruction from multiple, variable, and changing inputs, and learners are not equally gifted.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Jürgen M. Meisel (see record [rid]2011-09609-001[/rid]). The author's keynote article in this issue rightly makes a strong argument for the type of collaboration between linguists from several (sub)fields to do precisely this. I also agree with his view that at first sight not much seems to remain of the idea that L1 children are the agents of change if we take into account recent findings on child L1 acquisition. meets. In Meisel's view, bilingualism is the central key in our understanding of language change, as made explicit in the subtitle of his paper: "bilingualism as cause and effect of grammatical change". It is certainly true that in many cases change goes hand in hand with bilingualism. Meisel concludes that "reanalysis affecting parameter settings is much less likely to happen than is commonly assumed in historical linguistics". This indeed makes sense if L2 factors play an important role in change and if L1 acquisition is very robust, as Meisel describes. What makes the claim somewhat problematic, however, is that the notion parameter is nowadays in use for all sorts of micro variation and there hardly is a principled distinction with 'macro parameters'. Nobody will probably deny that change does take place regularly in the micro domains, but the implication is that we do not really understand why this would not be the case for the macro domains.

Abstract = {Ladd and Lenz (see record [rid]2008-02791-007[/rid]) question a central claim of affective intelligence theory (AIT), namely that anxiety affects political judgments indirectly by reducing the role of predispositions and increasing the role of contemporary information. They claim that alternative hypotheses, especially the notion that emotions are simply rationalizations of political preferences, better explain the role of emotion in politics. Their ultimate conclusions, however, rest on an overly narrow view of both theory and evidence. Even if one accepts Ladd and Lenz's reanalysis of survey data, there is insufficient evidence to cast aside either AIT or the hypothesis that anxiety affects the mode of political judgment. AIT explains a broad range of political relationships that are unchallenged by the reassessment and which cannot be explained by the offered alternatives. Moreover, numerous experimental studies reject the alternative explanations in favor of an exogenous, often interactive role for anxiety. AIT will surely require amendment, if not abandonment, someday. Competing theories of emotion already exist and, unlike the alternative championed by Ladd and Lenz, these theories too suggest a meaningful role for emotion in political judgment and behavior. For now, given all of the research to date, AIT is a robust competitor, scarcely in need of being “salvaged.” Burgeoning research on the political relevance of emotions will benefit from further debates, replications, and extensions, as long as new claims and evidence are put in proper perspective.

Abstract = {The dual process model of moral judgment (DPM; Greene et al., 2004) argues that such judgments are influenced by both emotion-laden intuition and controlled reasoning. These influences are associated with distinct neural circuitries and different response tendencies. After reanalyzing data from an earlier study, McGuire et al. (2009) questioned the level of support for the dual process model and asserted that the distinction between emotion evoking moral dilemmas (personal dilemmas) and those that do not trigger such intuitions (impersonal dilemmas) is spurious. Using similar reanalysis methods on data reported by Moore, Clark, & Kane (2008), we show that the personal/impersonal distinction is reliable. Furthermore, new data show that this distinction is fundamental to moral judgment across widely different cultures (U.S. and China) and supports claims made by the DPM.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by J. D. Heider and J.J. Skowronski (see record [rid]2007-05078-004[/rid]). The authors reanalyzed data from a set of studies—J. D. Heider and J.J. Skowronski (2007)—that explored links between the race IAT and discriminatory behavior. The studies in that report were designed to have methodological improvements over past studies of predictive validity, and the authors concluded that links between race IAT scores and “prejudiced responding” and “discriminatory behavior” were supported. Our reanalysis reveals that this was not the case for either study. Study 1 was designed to test for links between the race IAT and competitive behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma game. We found a pattern not conveyed in the original report, which is that the IAT predicted greater competition with both White and Black opponents. The IAT did not predict racially biased behavior. Study 2 was designed to test for links between the race IAT and friendliness of verbal and nonverbal treatment of confederates. We found that the published results for Study 2 were based on erroneous IAT scores. Analysis of the true data revealed that the race IAT did not predict racially biased behavior. These results add to recent evidence calling into question the predictive validity of the race IAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {According to social rank theory, involuntary subordination may be adaptive in species that compete for resources as a mechanism to switch off fighting behaviors when loss is imminent (thus saving an organism from injury). In humans, major depression is thought to occur when involuntary subordination becomes prolonged. The present study sought to operationalize involuntary subordination. Study 1 involved a reanalysis of a Gilbert and Allan (1998) study, with the hypothesis that social comparison (i.e., perceived status), submissive behavior, feelings of defeat, and entrapment would load on a common factor (interpreted as involuntary subordination). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis supported this model. In Study 2 measures of these same variables were administered to a group of undergraduate students. Eight items were selected from each measure (on the basis of item-total correlations) to form the Involuntary Subordination Questionnaire (ISQ). In Study 3 scores on the ISQ showed high levels of internal consistency and test–retest reliability in a sample of undergraduate students. Scores on the ISQ were significantly positively correlated with various neurotic personality styles and negatively correlated with variables indicating dominance or mastery. Involuntary subordination scores also significantly predicted change in social anxiety symptoms over 9 weeks. In Study 4 scores on the ISQ were examined in relation to nonverbal behaviors. In men, the ISQ was correlated with behaviors indicating a lack of confidence and submissiveness. Involuntary subordination appears to be a relatively stable trait with implications for personality, mood, and real-world behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: The symptom checklist SCL-27 is a short, multidimensional screening instrument for mental health problems. It contains six scales: depressive, dysthymic, vegetative, agoraphobic and sociophobic symptoms; symptoms of mistrust; and a global severity index (GSI-27). Methods: A survey of two student samples from Poland and Germany (n ∼ 400) is presented. Results: Most scales of the SCL-27 showed good to satisfactory reliability (i.e. Cronbach's α > 0.70). Some items displayed different characteristics in students than in non-student samples. These discrepancies can be explained partly by the particular situation students face and partly by some country-specific or language-specific aspects of the measuring instrument. Differences between Polish and German students were marginal at best; in general, the Polish students tended to assent more easily to the items of the SCL-27 than did the German students. Conclusions: The SCL-27 is suitable for international comparisons. In both, Germany and Poland, students display a characteristic response pattern that differs from those of other samples. It can be applied as a separate instrument or for reanalysis of data collected with the SCL-90_R. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Longitudinal research has demonstrated a link between exposure to sexual content in media and subsequent changes in adolescent sexual behavior, including initiation of intercourse and various noncoital sexual activities. Based on a reanalysis of one of the data sets involved, Steinberg and Monahan (2011) have challenged these findings. However, propensity score approaches—especially the version of this method used by Steinberg and Monahan, which lacks covariates—do not necessarily result in more accurate estimates of treatment effects than does the regression with covariates approach employed by prior research. There are also a number of problems with the specific set of analyses presented by Steinberg and Monahan and the conclusion they draw from them. In contrast to Steinberg and Monahan's claim, there is substantial evidence of an association between sexual media exposure and adolescent sexual initiation.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Xiang Wan and Paul Pavlidis (see record [rid]2008-06150-005[/rid]). The authors present an excellent overview of efforts to make the reanalysis of microarray data a reality. As Wan and Pavlidis demonstrate, reanalysis of microarray data in neuroscience has not yet occurred to any significant extent. To understand why, it helps to examine the chain of events that constitute this endeavor. At the risk of oversimplification, I have divided this chain into five major events: sample collection, gene-expression profiling, annotation, sharing, and statistical analysts. Given the current state of computer science, there is little evidence that software capable of parsing a biomedical ontology to specify an appropriate analysis will appear on the horizon anytime soon, even for rigorously annotated data. I agree with the authors that software capable of combining a variety of microarray data sets would be an important step toward realizing the full potential of such experiments, and I share their desire to realize this goal. However, I strongly believe that, for the near future, we must emphasize the centrality of interdisciplinary collaboration in the reanalysis of microarray data, rather than promise the development of software supporting independent analysis, as the latter will be a long time in coming.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Z. G. Zhang et al. (see record [rid]2012-18575-016[/rid]). The goal of triplet paradigm is to identify key-evoked potential parameters that are less affected by stimulus energy and repetition and more strongly correlated with the subject’s perception of pain intensity. According to a recent study by Zhang et al. this is where gamma band oscillations (GBOs) might play a pivotal role in pain research. Zhang et al. reexamined data from the original triplet laser stimulation study with a focus on GBOs. The relationship between GBOs, stimulus repetition, and stimulus intensity is perhaps best illustrated in the left panel. While a relationship emerges between rating of perceived stimulus intensity, LEPs, and GBOs, only GBOs are unaffected by stimulus repetition. That is, GBOs do not appreciably change from one stimulus to the next, and thus, correspond with the rating of perceived intensity to a given stimuli. In the subsequent figures by Zhang et al., this point is illustrated and substantiated by statistical analysis revealing that the intensity of pain but not stimulus repetition or stimulus energy, resulted in significant changes in GBO magnitude. While Zhang et al. were not the first to identify the relationship between GBOs and pain intensity, the reanalysis of the triplet laser stimulation data controls for the potential confound of stimulus saliency. Given the marked effect of saliency on LEPs, it was important to test whether GBOs behave similarly. In contrast to LEP amplitude, laser-induced GBOs appear to represent a more direct measure of pain perception. To account for eye movements, Zhang et al. used independent component analysis to remove ocular artifacts. However, to further minimize the contribution of ocular artifacts, future experiments that aim to study pain-evoked GBOs should consider recently developed guidelines. In the context of clinical trials, GBOs may be useful to objectively monitor and track pain relief due to a therapeutic intervention. Monitoring continuous GBOs may also improve the objective assessment of pain. Such a technique could be equally or potentially more meaningful than event-related GBOs to diagnose spontaneous or idiopathic pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

These studies showed some interesting similarities in activation of brain regions involved in working memory functioning and its specific pattern in either depressed or elder persons. The next part presents the reanalysis of the performance of more or less complex working memory tasks by depressed and older adults. In these reanalyses we applied the Brinley plots for comparing results from different populations and from tasks of varied difficulty.

Abstract = {The role of grammatical gender and number representations in syntactic processes during reading in Spanish was studied using the event-related potentials (ERPs) technique. The electroencephalogram was recorded with a dense array of 128 electrodes while Spanish speakers read word pairs (Experiment 1) or sentences (Experiment 2) in which gender or number agreement relationships were manipulated. Disagreement in word pairs formed by a noun and an adjective (e.g., faro-alto [lighthouse-high]) produced an N400-type effect, while word pairs formed by an article and a noun (e.g., el-piano [the-piano]) showed an additional left anterior negativity effect (LAN). Agreement violations with the same words inserted in sentences (e.g., El piano estaba viejo y desafinado [them-spianom-s was oldm-s and off-key]) resulted in a pattern of LAN-P600. This effect was found both when the violation occurred in the middle of the sentence (at the adjective), as well as when this happened at the beginning of the sentence (at the noun), but the last segment of the P600 effect was greater for the middle sentence position, which could indicate differences in the complexity of reanalysis processes. Differences between grammatical gender and number disagreement were found in late measures. In the word pairs experiment, P3 peak latency varied across conditions, being later for gender than for number disagreement. Similarly, in the sentence experiment, the last segment of the P600 effect was greater for gender than for number violations. These event-related potentials (ERPs) effects lend support to the idea that reanalysis or repair processes after grammatical disagreement detection could involve more steps in the case of gender disagreement, as grammatical gender is a feature of the lexical representation in contrast to number, which is considered a morphological feature that combines with the stem of the word.

We identified the following problems with their analysis: Secondary, rather than primary, sources were used in the initial literature review; 15 studies were included that should have been omitted; there were no decision rules for calculating effect sizes, leading to inaccuracies in most of these; the statistical test used to compare categories was of low power; the coding of study characteristics was inaccurate. A reanalysis that corrected these problems produced a lower mean weighted correlation (r=.08 instead of the reported r=.14). The conclusions from our categorical comparisons were different from those of Book et al.: Neither of their positive findings (a decline with age; lower correlations in morning than afternoon samples) were confirmed. We found significant differences for sex, age, offender status, and source of hormone measure, all of which are different from those in the original analysis.

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the availability and the consistency of prevalence findings of epidemiological studies on cognitive impairment and dementia conducted in Eastern and Middle Europe. Methods: We adopted a stepwise multimethod study approach consisting of iterative literature searches for epidemiological articles published between 1990 and 2006 and subsequent data analyses of published material, reanalyses of existing accessible epidemiological data sets and expert inquiries in Eastern and Middle European countries. Systematic computer-assisted searches used the keywords: "dementia", "Alzheimer", "cognitive impairment", "incidence", "prevalence", "epidemiology" in combination with the name of the relevant countries or "Europe" in English and Polish language. We supplemented the literature search with a review of the references in the articles that were identified during the initial search. Results: We were able to find few regional and country-specific epidemiological studies of various kinds (population-based, cohort, cross-sectional studies) and conducted on different restricted population groups of patients (from neurological units, out-patients units, residential homes). No studies were identified from most of the countries taken under consideration and the ones we found were characterized by an immense diversity with a considerable degree of clinical and methodological variations. The few studies that there are suggest prevalence rates of dementia in Eastern Europe similar to those in Western Europe. Conclusions: There is strong need for epidemiological studies in Eastern and Middle Europe, as well as for greater coordination and standardization of methods to improve the quality and comparability of epidemiological data to determine the prevalences' rates of dementia in all the EU countries.

@article{2011-00808-00620110201,
Abstract = {Background: In addition to the canonical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, German also allows for non-canonical order (OVS), and the case-marking system supports thematic role interpretation. Previous eye-tracking studies (Kamide et al., 2003; Knoeferle, 2007) have shown that unambiguous case information in non-canonical sentences is processed incrementally. For individuals with agrammatic aphasia, comprehension of non-canonical sentences is at chance level (Burchert et al., 2003). The trace deletion hypothesis (Grodzinsky 1995, 2000) claims that this is due to structural impairments in syntactic representations, which force the individual with aphasia (IWA) to apply a guessing strategy. However, recent studies investigating online sentence processing in aphasia (Caplan et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 2007) found that divergences exist in IWAs' sentence-processing routines depending on whether they comprehended non-canonical sentences correctly or not, pointing rather to a processing deficit explanation. Aims: The aim of the current study was to investigate agrammatic IWAs' online and offline sentence comprehension simultaneously in order to reveal what online sentence-processing strategies they rely on and how these differ from controls' processing routines. We further asked whether IWAs' offline chance performance for non-canonical sentences does indeed result from guessing. Methods & Procedures: We used the visual-world paradigm and measured eye movements (as an index of online sentence processing) of controls (N = 8) and individuals with aphasia (N = 7) during a sentence-picture matching task. Additional offline measures were accuracy and reaction times. Outcomes & Results: While the offline accuracy results corresponded to the pattern predicted by the TDH, IWAs' eye movements revealed systematic differences depending on the response accuracy. Conclusions: These findings constitute evidence against attributing IWAs' chance performance for non-canonical structures to mere guessing. Instead, our results support processing deficit explanations and characterise the agrammatic parser as deterministic and inefficient: it is slowed down, affected by intermittent deficiencies in performing syntactic operations, and fails to compute reanalysis even when one is detected.

This reanalysis supports percent of subjects with no heavy drinking days as the primary outcome. Appropriately, Falk et al. also encourage the search for "more sensitive and clinically meaningful outcome measures, including alcohol sensitive biomarkers". At least 2 of the drugs examined in the secondary analysis by Falk et al. began life as drugs approved for a different indication (naltrexone and topirimate). Finally, the early era of psychotropic drug development required the focused efforts of a distinct center at NIMH, that actually had to be mandated by an act of Congress. The progress that has been made in the past decade was a consequence of focused and wise leadership at NIAAA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {During sentence processing there is a preference to treat the first noun phrase found as the subject and agent, unless marked the other way. This preference would lead to a conflict in thematic role assignment when the syntactic structure conforms to a non-canonical object-before-subject pattern. Left perisylvian and fronto-parietal brain networks have been found to be engaged by increased computational demands during sentence comprehension, while event-reated brain potentials have been used to study the on-line manifestation of these demands. However, evidence regarding the spatiotemporal organization of brain networks in this domain is scarce. In the current study we used Magnetoencephalography to track spatio-temporally brain activity while Spanish speakers were reading subject- and object-first cleft sentences. Both kinds of sentences remained ambiguous between a subject-first or an object-first interpretation up to the appearance of the second argument. Results show the time-modulation of a frontal network at the disambiguation point of object-first sentences. Moreover, the time windows where these effects took place have been previously related to thematic role integration (300–500ms) and to sentence reanalysis and resolution of conflicts during processing (beyond 500ms post-stimulus). These results point to frontal cognitive control as a putative key mechanism which may operate when a revision of the sentence structure and meaning is necessary.

Abstract = {The relationship between interference and facilitation effects in the Stroop task is poorly understood yet central to its implications. At question is the modal view that they arise from a single mechanism—the congruency of color and word. Two developments have challenged that view: (a) the belief that facilitation effects are fractionally small compared with interference effects, or nonexistent altogether; and (b) the finding that interference and facilitation effects are inversely correlated. Statistical simulations, reanalysis of past data, and two new experiments indicate that facilitation is robust and substantial when congruency is deconfounded from lexicality, and that the inverse correlations are mostly spurious. Instead, interference and facilitation are uncorrelated, or at most weakly but inversely related. Resolution of response conflict and lexical convergence can explain either finding. Modeling and interpretation of the Stroop task must distinguish between nonspecific lexicality-based effects and specific color-word congruency effects.

Abstract = {The present study aimed to examine the influence of musical expertise on the metric and semantic aspects of speech processing. In two attentional conditions (metric and semantic tasks), musicians listened to short sentences ending in trisyllabic words that were semantically and/or metrically congruous or incongruous. Both ERPs and behavioral data were analyzed and the results were compared to previous nonmusicians' data. Regarding the processing of meter, results showed that musical expertise influenced the automatic detection of the syllable temporal structure (P200 effect), the integration of metric structure and its influence on word comprehension (N400 effect), as well as the reanalysis of metric violations (P600 and late positivities effects). By contrast, results showed that musical expertise did not influence the semantic level of processing. These results are discussed in terms of transfer of training effects from music to speech processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Our programmatic article on Homo heuristicus (Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009) included a methodological section specifying three minimum criteria for testing heuristics: competitive tests, individual‐level tests, and tests of adaptive selection of heuristics. Using Richter and Späth's (2006) study on the recognition heuristic, we illustrated how violations of these criteria can lead to unsupported conclusions. In their comment, Hilbig and Richter conduct a reanalysis, but again without competitive testing. They neither test nor specify the compensatory model of inference they argue for. Instead, they test whether participants use the recognition heuristic in an unrealistic 100% (or 96%) of cases, report that only some people exhibit this level of consistency, and conclude that most people would follow a compensatory strategy. We know of no model of judgment that predicts 96% correctly. The curious methodological practice of adopting an unrealistic measure of success to argue against a competing model, and to interpret such a finding as a triumph for a preferred but unspecified model, can only hinder progress. Marewski, Gaissmaier, Schooler, Goldstein, and Gigerenzer (2010), in contrast, specified five compensatory models, compared them with the recognition heuristic, and found that the recognition heuristic predicted inferences most accurately.

This article subjects a randomized controlled trial (RCT) published in the American Journal of Psychiatry to a methodological and statistical critique, including a reanalysis of the effect size statistics presented. The published trial tested the use of combination antidepressants (mirtazapine coprescribed with either bupropion, venlafaxine, or fluoxetine) at treatment initiation as compared with fluoxetine monotherapy. The authors report that combination therapy was effective, with a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) statistic of 3-5, a strong effect size. Scrutiny of the methodology and clinical trial registration shows that 4 of 6 preregistered outcomes were statistically nonsignificant, 1 outcome was not reported, and 1 unregistered outcome was published. The well-critiqued Hamilton Depression Inventory was the only positive outcome measure. Calculating confidence intervals for the reported NNT demonstrates substantial uncertainty (95% CI for NNT = 2.3-18.0). In an era of evidence-based psychiatric practice, there is insufficient evidence to recommend combination therapy at initiation of treatment.

Abstract = {In this paper we report on a visual world eye-tracking experiment that investigated the differing abilities of adults and children to use referential scene information during reanalysis to overcome lexical biases during sentence processing. The results showed that adults incorporated aspects of the referential scene into their parse as soon as it became apparent that a test sentence was syntactically ambiguous, suggesting they considered the two alternative analyses in parallel. In contrast, the children appeared not to reanalyze their initial analysis, even over shorter distances than have been investigated in prior research. We argue that this reflects the children's over-reliance on bottom-up, lexical cues to interpretation. The implications for the development of parsing routines are discussed.

Abstract = {This study analyzed the electrophysiological correlates of language switching in second language learners. Participants were native Spanish speakers classified in two groups according to English proficiency (high and low). Event‐related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while they read English sentences, half of which contained an adjective in Spanish in the middle of the sentence. The ERP results show the time‐course of language switch processing for both groups: an initial detection of the switch driven by language‐specific orthography (left‐occipital N250) followed by costs at the level of the lexico‐semantic system (N400), and finally a late updating or reanalysis process (LPC). In the high proficiency group, effects in the N400 time window extended to left anterior electrodes and were followed by larger LPC amplitudes at posterior sites. These differences suggest that proficiency modulates the different processes triggered by language switches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about the impact of CBT on frontostriatal dysfunctioning, known to be the neuronal correlate of OCD. Method: A probabilistic reversal learning (RL) task probing adaptive strategy switching capabilities was used in 10 unmedicated patients with OCD and 10 healthy controls during an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Patients were scanned before and after intensive CBT, controls twice at comparable intervals. Results: Strategy change within the RL task involved activity in a broad frontal network in patients and controls. No significant differences between the groups or in group by time interactions were detected in a whole-brain analysis corrected for multiple comparisons. However, a reanalysis with a more lenient threshold revealed decreased responsiveness of the orbitofrontal cortex and right putamen during strategy change before treatment in patients compared with healthy subjects. A group by time effect was found in the caudate nucleus, demonstrating increased activity for patients over the course of time. Patients with greater clinical improvement, reflected by greater reductions in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores, showed more stable activation in the pallidum. Conclusions: Although these findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they indicate a possible influence of psychotherapy on brain activity in core regions that have been shown to be directly involved both in acquisition of behavioral rules and stereotypes and in the pathophysiology of OCD, the caudate nucleus and the pallidum.

Abstract = {Background: In 2002 an American cargo plane and a Russian passenger plane collided over the Lake of Constance and 71 people died, among them 45 children. Methods: Police officers engaged in the aftermath of this disaster were investigated anonymously one year later by a questionnaire for assessing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Primarily the PTSD Symptom Scale Self-Report (PSS-SR) was applied. Main aim of the research was a reanalysis of the data, adding multivariate analyses for possibly influencing factors and for the identification of risk clusters. The PSS-SR with 17 items assesses the criteria of PTSD after DSM-IV including the scales flashback, arousal and avoidance. The data basis was provided by answers of 1103 police officers. Results:The full criteria of PTSD after DSM-IV were reached by 3.1 % of the officers one year after the disaster. After the criteria of ICD-10 7% had PTSD; but subsyndromal scores much often occurred. Bivariate correlations of the PSS whole score showed significant correlations with age, the durance of the action and the numbers of straining events, but correlations did not exceed r = 0.25. The cluster analysis yielded a clear risk cluster (approx. 20% of the officers) with high PSS-SR scores (mean = 4.4), which was characterised by the longest action times (accordingly a high number of straining events), and primarily by an intense confrontation with corpses. The results show a marked dose effect relationship with respect to action typical strains and the development of a PTSD. Conclusions: The results clearly speak for a special aftercare for officers with the risk constellations found—independent from whether the officer directly asks for care or expresses needs in a screening questionnaire.

Abstract = {Psycholinguistic investigations of reanalysis phenomena have typically focused on revisions of phrase structure. Here, we identify a further subcomponent of syntactic reanalysis, namely the revision of case marking. This aspect of reanalysis was isolated by examining German subject-object ambiguities that require a revision towards a dative-initial order. Since dative-initial orders are potentially unmarked, no phrase structure corrections are required, but the original, preference-based nominative assignment must be revised. Experiment 1, an ERP study, revealed an N400 component for reanalysis of case marking, which contrasted with a P600 component for phrase structure revisions. The 'reanalysis N400' was replicated in Experiment 2, which also showed that direct lexical support for a dative-initial order leads to a reduction of the effect. Finally, in Experiment 3, direct time course measures provided by the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure supported the case reanalysis account by showing that conditions hypothesized to involve case reanalysis (dative-initial structures) require longer computation times than their nominative-initial counterparts. Lexeme-specific support for the dative-initial reading, however, does not lead to a faster computation of the target structure, but rather increases the likelihood that the correct interpretation will be computed. We interpret these findings as evidence for the general availability of an unmarked dative-nominative word order in German, the accessibility of which may be increased by lexical information. Moreover, the data show that syntactic reanalysis is not a homogeneous process, but may rather be subdivided along several dimensions that interact in determining overall garden path strength.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 11(1) of International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (see record [rid]2007-04780-015[/rid]). During the course of monitoring and audit of one of the sites conducting a trial with paliperidone ER in subjects with schizophrenia, serious violations of GCP were found. All ongoing trials were terminated at this site. In addition, a review of previous trials undertaken by this site, including RIS-INT-59, was conducted. Although there was no evidence of violations of GCP in the past at this site, in order to be prudent and cautious, Janssen-Cilag decided to reanalyse the primary efficacy endpoints, after excluding all subjects who participated at this centre. It was also decided that, in order to be transparent, the results of this reanalysis would be conveyed to relevant regulatory authorities and journals. The results of this reanalysis are shown in the current article, which should replace Table 1 of the original paper.] OBJECTIVE: The aim of this open multicenter international study was an assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone administered for 12 months in patients with early schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred and five patients, 113 male and 92 female, aged 15-46 years were included. The mean daily risperidone dose was 3.3 ± 1.4 mg/day and in three-quarters of patients the dose was in the range of 2-4 mg. For psychometric assessment the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were used. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two patients (64%) completed the study. Significant improvement (at least 20% reduction) was found on PANSS subscales for positive symptoms (89% of patients), negative symptoms (77% of patients), as well as for depressive symptoms measured by MADRS (78% of patients). Parkinsonian symptoms occurred in 53 patients (26.5%), necessitating the use of anticholinergic drugs. Risperidone treatment did not exert a significant effect on vital signs and on ECG recordings. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, in a substantial proportion of patients with early schizophrenia, risperidone can be successfully used for initiation of pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia and then be continued on the long-term basis.

Abstract = {Classifiers in Mandarin Chinese typically occur after a numeral and before a noun. In this paper, we examine the interactions that the Mandarin general classifier, ge, has with its neighboring elements as they form constructions. Taking the usage-based approach, we investigate post-verbal constructions involving ge, i.e., 'V yi ge N' and its variations. Because of repeated use, the prototypical 'V yi ge N' gives rise to some variant constructions through formal reduction and some other through reanalysis and decategorization. Some of the variant constructions can express the speaker's stance, and we analyze the pragmatic inferencing steps that derive these evaluative meanings and study how some of these meanings are strategically exploited in clause structure and in discourse interaction. Our analysis points to the significance of the collocational/metonymic association between co-occurring linguistic elements in forming constructions and developing constructional meanings. Our study also shows that frequent use is the source for the establishment of the prototype, which in turn provides a point of departure for the application of pragmatic principles, formal reanalysis, and the inclusive interpretation of non-prototypical, extensional uses.

Though many randomized trials have been conducted, these have been criticized for deficiencies of methodology, acupuncture technique, and sample size. Somewhat less emphasis has been placed on methods of statistical analysis. This paper describes 4 recent randomized trials of acupuncture for musculoskeletal or headache pain. Each trial used statistical methods that did not adjust for baseline pain scores and were thus of suboptimal power. The objective of this study is to reanalyze the trials using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Methods: Raw data for the 4 trials were obtained from the original authors. Data were reanalyzed by ANCOVA. Results: For 2 trials--acupuncture versus placebo for chronic headache and acupuncture versus transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation for back pain--reanalysis did not change the conclusion of no difference between groups, but showed that clinically significant differences between groups could not ruled out. Reanalysis of a trial of acupuncture versus placebo for shoulder pain slightly strengthened the evidence of acupuncture effectiveness. Reanalysis of the fourth trial, which compared acupuncture to placebo acupuncture and massage for neck pain, reversed the results of the original paper: reanalysis found acupuncture to be effective and that its effectiveness could not be ascribed to a placebo effect. Discussion: Future trials of acupuncture and other modalities for pain should use efficient statistical methods. ANCOVA is more efficient than unadjusted analysis where used appropriately.

Abstract = {A. Toomela (2003) concluded that personality structure may be shaped by a cultural mechanism, word meaning structure, and that the apparent universality of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) was the result of inadequate sampling of concrete thinkers. A reanalysis using targeted rotation showed that the intended structure was generally replicated; small deviations in the most concrete thinkers were probably due to measurement error. The reanalysis authors found no evidence of structural differences in a second sample of adults classified as concrete or abstract thinkers. The FFM structure has been replicated in many samples containing individuals with cognitive or educational limitations; observer ratings may be preferred if these limitations are severe. To date, there is no compelling evidence that culture affects personality structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Napier and Walker's (1967) locomotor category of vertical clinging and leaping (VC&L) is one of the most familiar in primatology, and tarsiers are probably the most morphologically specialized of its membership. However, the link between vertical clinging and leaping remains unelucidated. We attempt to do so by reanalysis of Crompton's 1985 and 1986 field observations of locomotion and habitat use in Tarsius bancanus, using loglinear modeling. Loglinear modeling is better suited to the categorical variables used in many field studies than more traditional statistics, such as ANOVA, developed for continuous variables. We show that climbing, as well as leaping, is one of the predominant forms of locomotion, and that all other things being equal, tarsiers tend to take off from, and land on, similar sized supports, which suggests that the following findings are not likely to be a result of substrate availability alone. Small body size lead to a prediction that tarsiers should leap down but climb up: this was not sustained: rather leaps tend to be level, and climbing accounts for more height loss than randomly expected. However, a prediction that to avoid energy loss to the substrate, the tarsiers should show a preference for large diameter supports for takeoff when leaping longer distances was supported, although tarsiers do not avoid moderately compliant supports. The prediction from ballistic principles that the longest leaps should start from high-angled supports was only weakly sustained, but low-angled supports tend to be strongly associated with short leaps, suggesting that such supports do not facilitate 45° takeoff trajectories. However, tarsiers displayed a preference for landing on medium-sized supports when leaping long distances, suggesting a preference for balancing the need for stability with minimizing musculoskeletal shock.

Abstract = {Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been used for several decades in criminal justice research to assess the benefits of interventions. RCTs have been employed with some frequency in evaluating batterer intervention programs (BIPs); between 1990 and 2005, there were five RCTs of BIPs. While most of these studies failed to find positive findings, one conducted in Brooklyn, New York, appeared to detect a positive effect of a BIP on domestic violence re-offending. Subsequent inspection of the data, however, revealed several complicating factors that led us to reanalyze these data. Our reanalysis focused on whether the intervention temporarily suppresses abusive behavior during the time that offenders are under court control, or whether the program produces lasting changes in offender behavior. With improved data analysis techniques, additional outcome data, and several alternative analytical models, we arrive at an alternative conclusion than is reported in the original publication. While we still find evidence of a reduction in the number of new incidents across a 15-month period due to treatment assignment, we now find that the effect of attending treatment does not likely persist beyond the treatment period once the treatment measure is specified as a time-dependent parameter rather than a fixed effect. This outcome is more consistent with a suppression/supervision explanation rather than a therapeutic outcome explanation. The implications of these results are discussed.

Abstract = {Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico has been the focus of much recent archaeological research on Pueblo groups who lived during the 9th through 12th centuries in the American Southwest. Here, we examine variation in mortuary patterns in the canyon, focusing in particular on one mortuary crypt, to address questions of social differentiation and the chronology of important sociopolitical processes. Based on new radiocarbon dates as well as reanalysis of the stratigraphy and spatial distribution of materials in the mortuary crypt, we conclude that significant social differentiation began in Chaco ca. 150–200 y earlier than suggested by previous research. We argue that social inequality was sanctified and legitimized by linking people to founders, ancestors, and cosmological forces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This article presents a set of research studies that aim to adapt Carol Ryff s scales of psychological wellbeing (SPWB) and to analyze its psychometric properties in adolescents. The first two studies focused on the reliability and factorial validity of different Portuguese short versions of SPWB, revealing measurement models inadequacies and low internal consistency. In the third study we developed a shortened version (30 items), taking into account the application of psychometric criteria suggested by van Dierendonck (2005). The scales of this version revealed better reliability and adequate goodness of fit indices for the six-factor model, as proposed by Carol Ryff's PWB theory. Although further research focused on the psychometrical properties reanalysis of this shortened version of SPWB is needed, this article provides a contribution to the research and intervention on positive mental health during adolescence.

Abstract = {Male and female participants were instructed to produce an altered response pattern on an Implicit Association Test measure of gender identity by slowing performance in trials requiring the same response to stimuli designating own gender and self. Participants’ faking success was found to be predictable by a measure of slowing relative to unfaked performances. This combined task slowing (CTS) indicator was then applied in reanalyses of three experiments from other laboratories, two involving instructed faking and one involving possibly motivated faking. Across all studies involving instructed faking, CTS correctly classified 75% of intentionally faking participants. Using the CTS index to adjust faked Implicit Association Test scores increased the correlation of CTS-adjusted measures with known group membership, relative to unadjusted (i.e., faked) measures.

Abstract = {A-wave is a late motor response that maintains the same characteristics of latency, amplitude and shape with every electrical stimuli at a proper given intensity. The presence of A-waves was reported both in chronic (CIDP) and acute (AIDP) forms of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. It is attributed to the effect of either sprouting phenomena or ephaptic/ectopic discharge. In the first condition it could be a sign of functional recovery, while in the second it could represent an early indicator of demyelination. Aims of our research were to investigate retrospectively the presence of the A-waves, establishing whether its frequency is more common in CIDP or AIDP. Data from 77 patients, 57 male and 20 female, mean age 60.7 years (SD 15.4), were recovered from clinical records and their neurophysiological tests retrieved for reanalysis. Our results seem to indicate that A-waves can represent an early sign of acute pathology of peripheral nervous system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Perceptual systems must learn to explore and to use the resulting information to hone performance. Optimal performance depends on using information available at many time scales, from the near instantaneous values of variables underlying perception (i.e., detection), to longer term information about appropriate scaling (i.e., calibration), to yet longer term information guiding variable use (i.e., attunement). Fractal fluctuations in explorations would entail fluctuation at all time scales, allowing perceptual systems a flexible way to detect information at all time scales. We tested whether perceptual learning in dynamic touch is related to the fractality of wielding behaviors. A reanalysis of wielding behaviors from Arzamarski, Isenhower, Kay, Turvey, and Michaels (2010) revealed that exploratory movements were fractal and that a fractal-scaling exponent predicts individual differences in haptic judgments.

Abstract = {Context: Diagnostic errors have been associated with bias in clinical reasoning. Empirical evidence on the cognitive mechanisms underlying biases and effectiveness of educational strategies to counteract them is lacking. Objectives: To investigate whether recent experience with clinical problems provokes availability bias (overestimation of the likelihood of a diagnosis based on the ease with which it comes to mind) resulting in diagnostic errors and whether reflection (structured reanalysis of the case findings) counteracts this bias. Design, Setting, and Participants: Experimental study conducted in 2009 at the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, with 18 first-year and 18 second-year internal medicine residents. Participants first evaluated diagnoses of 6 clinical cases (phase 1). Subsequently, they diagnosed 8 different cases through nonanalytical reasoning, 4 of which had findings similar to previously evaluated cases but different diagnoses (phase 2). These 4 cases were subsequently diagnosed again through reflective reasoning (phase 3). Main Outcome Measures: Mean diagnostic accuracy scores (perfect score, 4.0) on cases solved with or without previous exposure to similar problems through nonanalytical (phase 2) or reflective (phase 3) reasoning and frequency that a potentially biased (ie, phase 1) diagnosis was given. Results: There were no main effects, but there was a significant interaction effect between "years of training" and "recent experiences with similar problems." Results consistent with an availability bias occurred for the second-year residents, who scored lower on the cases similar to those previously encountered (1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.96) than on the other cases (2.19; 95% CI, 1.73-2.66; P =.03). This pattern was not seen among the first-year residents (2.03; 95% CI, 1.55-2.51 vs 1.42; 95% CI, 0.92-1.92; P =.046). Second-year residents provided the phase 1 diagnosis more frequently for phase 2 cases they had previously encountered than for those they had not (mean frequency per resident, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.93-1.96 vs 0.72; 95% CI, 0.28-1.17; P =.04). A significant main effect of reasoning mode was found: reflection improved the diagnoses of the similar cases compared with nonanalytical reasoning for the second-year residents (2.03; 95% CI, 1.49-2.57) and the first-year residents (2.31; 95% CI, 1.89-2.73; P =.006). Conclusion: When faced with cases similar to previous ones and using nonanalytic reasoning, second-year residents made errors consistent with the availability bias. Subsequent application of diagnostic reflection tended to counter this bias; it improved diagnostic accuracy in both first- and second-year residents.

Abstract = {The assumption of strongly ignorable treatment assignment is required for eliminating selection bias in observational studies. To meet this assumption, researchers often rely on a strategy of selecting covariates that they think will control for selection bias. Theory indicates that the most important covariates are those highly correlated with both the real selection process and the potential outcomes. However, when planning a study, it is rarely possible to identify such covariates with certainty. In this article, we report on an extensive reanalysis of a within-study comparison that contrasts a randomized experiment and a quasi-experiment. Various covariate sets were used to adjust for initial group differences in the quasi-experiment that was characterized by self-selection into treatment. The adjusted effect sizes were then compared with the experimental ones to identify which individual covariates, and which conceptually grouped sets of covariates, were responsible for the high degree of bias reduction achieved in the adjusted quasi-experiment. Such results provide strong clues about preferred strategies for identifying the covariates most likely to reduce bias when planning a study and when the true selection process is not known.

Abstract = {In their 2007 article in this journal, Duncan et al. examined 6 longitudinal data sets to gauge the links between 3 key elements of readiness at school entry (academic, attention, and socioemotional skills) and later achievement. Across all 6 data sets, the strongest predictors of later achievement were school-entry math, reading, and attention skills. Social skills and internalizing and externalizing behavior did not predict subsequent achievement, even among children with relatively high levels of problem behavior. Patterns of association were similar for boys and girls and were not moderated by socioeconomic status. The 5 articles in this section reconsider the original findings and reanalyze the data involved. Overall, the thrust of these articles confirms the original article. The articles in this section, however, do offer some new insights. In general, the articles find somewhat more support for socioemotional factors, especially for prosocial skills, but the relationships involved are very small. Perhaps the most striking new finding is the added emphasis on fine motor skills, which is the focus of 2 articles. Taken together, the articles reveal the value of reanalysis and replication in developmental psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Based on written and spoken corpora, this paper examines the on-going functional shift of the Japanese connective shi ‘and, and so’ into a sentence-final particle. The paper will first identify and clarify the functions of this newly emerging usage. As a sentence-final particle, shi indicates the speaker’s emotional stance (that is often negative) toward the proposition, context, or the addressee. We then propose that the reanalysis of shi from a coordinate conjunction to a sentence-final particle is an instance of ‘subjectification’ and ‘intersubjectification’ (Traugott, 2003). We also argue that the change is motivated by the frequency of the specific structural and communicative context of its use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The majority of deaths in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) follow decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Clinicians use prognostic tests including MRI to help determine prognosis and decide whether to consider treatment withdrawal. A recently published meta-analysis provided valuable information on the prognostic utility of magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers in HIE and suggested, in particular, that proton MR spectroscopy is the most accurate predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome. How should this evidence influence treatment-limitation decisions? In this article I outline serious limitations in existing prognostic studies of HIE, including small sample size, selection bias, vague and overly inclusive outcome assessment, and potential self-fulfilling prophecies. Such limitations make it difficult to answer the most important prognostic question. Reanalysis of published data reveals that severe abnormalities on conventional MRI in the first week have a sensitivity of 71% (95% confidence interval: 59%–91%) and specificity of 84% (95% confidence interval: 68%–93%) for very adverse outcome in infants with moderate encephalopathy. On current evidence, MR biomarkers alone are not sufficiently accurate to direct treatment-limitation decisions. Although there may be a role for using MRI or MR spectroscopy in combination with other prognostic markers to identify infants with very adverse outcome, it is not possible from meta-analysis to define this group clearly. There is an urgent need for improved prognostic research into HIE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

(b) To what extent can the original models be successfully replicated? Regarding (a), we e-mailed authors of 31 articles that did not contain information needed to replicate the study and asked them for the missing information. We obtained data from only four authors. Regarding (b), we succeeded in replicating 89% of the models in the preliminary analysis, 87% to 100% of fit indices, and 94% of parameter estimates.

Abstract = {Objective: Comparison of 4-week, 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of mental disorders between the German general population and persons without German nationality who were not born in Germany (migrants). Methods: A migration-sensitive reanalysis of the supplement survey "mental disorders" of the German Health Survey 1998/1999 was conducted. 143 migrants were compared with 3,740 Germans. Results: Results demonstrate significantly higher 4-week, 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of mental disorders for migrants in comparison to Germans. These differences are highest regarding affective disorders (4-week prevalence: 11.7 vs. 5.8 %; 12-month prevalence: 17.9 vs. 11.3 %; lifetime prevalence: 24.9 vs. 18.2 %) and somatoform disorders (4-week prevalence: 15.5 vs. 6.9 %; 12-month prevalence: 19.9 vs. 10.3 %; lifetime prevalence: 24.1 vs. 15.4 %). Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of a differentiating examination of prevalence rates for migrants. They also serve as a basis for further investigation of the relation between migration and mental health as well as for developing a cultural sensitive health care.

Abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like paroxetine have replaced older antidepressants mainly because of a more favorable safety profile, but they are still associated with burdensome side effects. We investigate the tolerability of St. John's wort extract WS 5570, a herbal antidepressant with proven efficacy, in comparison to paroxetine and other SSRIs and placebo. A reanalysis was performed based on the original data from four controlled clinical trials during which 1661 outpatients with major depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria) received between 600 and 1800 mg/day WS 5570 (n=1264), 20 or 40 mg/day paroxetine (n=126), or placebo (n=271) for 6 weeks. For single and grouped adverse events, the risk ratios for treatment group comparisons were determined along with their 95% confidence intervals, including comparisons with published data for SSRIs. Across the four trials, the percentage of patients with any adverse events under WS 5570 exposition was comparable with placebo [risk ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.1 (0.9–1.3) in favor of WS 5570] and significantly lower than for paroxetine [2.4 (2.1–2.8)]. Compared with the herbal extract adverse event rates under paroxetine were between 10 and 38-fold higher (point estimates) in five out of seven symptom clusters inspected. WS 5570 was devoid of effects of sedation, anticholinergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and sexual dysfunction often found during treatment with SSRIs and other synthetic antidepressants. In conclusion, WS 5570 exhibits substantially lower incidence rates of adverse events than paroxetine and other SSRIs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {State-trace analysis was used to investigate the effect of concurrent working memory load on perceptual category learning. Initial reanalysis of Zeithamova and Maddox (2006, Experiment 1) revealed an apparently two-dimensional state-trace plot consistent with a dual-system interpretation of category learning. However, three modified replications of the original experiment found evidence of a single resource underlying the learning of both rule-based and information integration category structures. Follow-up analyses of the Zeithamova and Maddox data, restricted to only those participants who had learned the category task and performed the concurrent working memory task adequately, revealed a one-dimensional plot consistent with a single-resource interpretation and the results of the three new experiments. The results highlight the potential of state-trace analysis in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms underlying category learning.

Abstract = {The purpose of this ethnographic study was to examine employed mothers’ social support network composition in relation to their orientation to worker ideology. A reanalysis of data from two longitudinal, interview studies was conducted. Ecomaps were developed to depict women’s social support network composition, revealing five types of support sources: household family, nonhousehold family, friends and neighbors, workplace, and formal services. A typology of diverse, restricted, and mixed networks, reflecting patterns in availability, consistency, and types of support sources, was identified and analyzed in relation to women’s orientation to worker ideology. Women with innovator or conformist orientations to worker ideology tended to have mixed or diverse networks. Women with a conformist orientation did not utilize formal services but tended to have a supportive workplace. Most of the women who transitioned into an innovator orientation had available, consistent support, most notably from household family. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Antipathetic relationships and friendships are common during adolescence. One type of antipathetic relationship that has received no empirical attention is one that emerges from a broken friendship. Two studies, a reanalysis of N. A. Card’s previously published data (Study 1) and newly collected data (Study 2), investigated this topic through mixed-methods analysis of emerging adults’ retrospective reports of relationships during high school. Qualitative analyses revealed jealousy, incompatibility, intimacy-rule violations, and aggression as themes in the transformation of friendship to antipathy. Quantitative analyses revealed intimacy-rule violations in the formation; relational aggression, competition, and avoidance during the maintenance; and continued contact following high school as more common for former friends. These findings highlight the dynamic relations between friendship and antipathy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Opponent-process theories of externalizing disorders (ExD) attribute them to some combination of overactive reward processing systems and or underactive behavior inhibition systems. Reward processing has been indexed by recruitment of incentive-motivational neurocircuitry of the ventral striatum (VS), including nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an incentive task to determine whether externalizing symptomatology in adolescence is correlated with an enhanced VS recruitment by cues for rewards, or by deliveries of rewards. Twelve community-recruited adolescents with externalizing disorders (AED) and 12 age gender-matched controls responded to targets to win or avoid losing 0, 0.20, 1, 5, or an unknown amount (ranging from 0.20 to 5). Cues to respond for rewards activated the NAcc (relative to cues for no incentive), in both subject groups similarly, with greatest NAcc recruitment by cues for the largest reward. Loss-anticipatory NAcc signal increase was detected in a volume-of-interest analysis but this increase occurred only in trials when subjects hit the target. Relative to controls, AED showed significantly elevated NAcc activation by a linear contrast between reward notification versus notification of failure to win reward. In a post hoc reanalysis, VS and pregenual anterior cingulate activation by the reward versus non-reward outcome contrast also directly correlated with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Externalizing total scores (across all subjects) in lieu of a binary diagnosis. Finally, both groups showed right insula activation by loss notifications (contrasted with avoided losses). Externalizing behavior, whether assessed dimensionally with a questionnaire, or in the form of a diagnostic categorization, is associated with an exaggerated limbic response to outcomes of reward-directed behavior. This could be a neurobiological signature of the behavioral sensitivity to laboratory reward delivery that is characteristic of children with externalizing symptomatology. Of interest is future research on incentive-motivational processing in more severe, clinically referred AED. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in patients with confusion may be difficult to distinguish from nonepileptic (metabolic/toxic, postanoxic, and spongiform) encephalopathies. This study aimed to describe the misleading presentation of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) who were initially diagnosed with a refractory NCSE (rNCSE). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, EEG records, brain MRI scans, 14-3-3 protein detection in CSF, genotype of the prion protein gene, and neuropathologic data of patients referred to our neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) with this presentation. Results: Ten patients with a final diagnosis of definite (n = 7) or probable (n = 3) sCJD were referred to our NICU with an initial diagnosis of rNCSE. Reanalysis of the EEG ruled out ictal rhythmic activities, but showed diffuse, periodic, or semiperiodic sharp-wave complexes (PSWC) with short period. PSWC were briefly attenuated by auditory (n = 5) or painful (n = 3) stimuli and by IV injection of antiepileptic drugs (n = 5) but without clinical improvement. In addition, PSWC showed fluctuations according to the vigilance level (n = 5). Brain MRI showed hyperintensities in basal ganglia (n = 9/10) and in cortical areas (n = 7/10). 14-3-3 Protein was detected in CSF (n = 10). Only 2 sCJD subtypes were found (MM1 5/7, MV1 2/7). Conclusions: This series of patients suggests that sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis, rather than as a cause, of apparent refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus diagnosis should rely on careful examination of both EEG parameters and clinical state so that aggressive, unnecessary treatments can be avoided.

Abstract = {This study uses self-report measures completed by one hundred and twenty three (123) undergraduate technology students to investigate the validity of Peterson and Seligman’s (2004) classification system of 24 character strengths embodied in six core virtues. Using exploratory factor analyses we found, that an exact convergence of the character strengths was explicitly absent with the six-virtues. In our study, a five-factor solution was more comprehensive and well representing the resultant factor loadings upon analyzing the data which is further compared to a similar empirical study available for analyzing structural dynamics. In this paper, we have discussed the five-factor solution and renamed the dimensions to show a legitimate picture of the classification system, which requires further justification, and in addition, advocates reanalysis and reinterpretation of the originally propounded values in action (VIA) classification as a recommendation for future research.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by R. C. Green et al. (see record [rid]2010-01838-001[/rid]) regarding the effect of tarenflurbil on cognitive and functional decline in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. These investigators used a rigorous design and a long exposure period of 18 months. During the trial protocol, modifications were made (based on reanalysis of phase 2 data) consisting of shifting from 2 doses to a single high dose and modifying entry criteria to include only very mildly impaired subjects (with Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scores of 20-26 inclusive). In the face of these modifications and the relatively long exposure period, most subjects (97%) were available for the primary analysis and the mean medication compliance rate was higher than 90%. It is therefore quite disappointing to see the dramatic lack of effect in the primary and secondary outcomes, with the exception of the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores, which favored placebo. So why did this fail? Were there any data that should have limited enthusiasm to move to a phase 3 study? Was there false enthusiasm that moved this trial beyond the apparent data? There are several things to consider. These are elucidated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Psychotherapy–pharmacotherapy combinations are frequently recommended for the treatment of chronic depressive disorders. Our aim in this novel reanalysis of archival data was to identify patient subgroups on the basis of symptom trajectories and examine the clinical significance of the resultant classification on basis of differential treatment effects to psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy), pharmacotherapy (nefazodone), and their combination. Method: We selected data for 504 patients diagnosed with chronic depression from archival data of a clinical trial (N = 681) and analyzed treatment courses (as assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) using growth mixture models, a contemporary exploratory analysis technique. Results: Three patient subgroups were identified from the typical patterns of change of depression severity during 12-week acute-phase treatment. Within these patient subgroups, differential treatment effects were evident: combination treatment clearly outperformed the 2 monotherapies in the largest patient subgroup, characterized by moderate depression severity, but not in the remaining 2 subgroups, characterized by low and severe depression at baseline. Patient characteristics prior to initiation of treatment enabled allocation of 61% of patients to these subgroups. Conclusions: Research on patient subgroups with different change patterns may support classifications of patients that indicate which treatment is most effective for which type of patient.

Abstract = {Nail and McGregor (2009) reported that a sample of Americans drawn soon after the Al Qaeda attacks on 9/11/01 reported more conservative political attitudes than a similar sample drawn in 2000. This conservative shift was strongest on two items with direct relevance to 9/11/01, George W. Bush and Increasing Military Spending, but also extended to two residual items not connected with 9/11/01. Curiously, no effects were found on four other residual items. A reanalysis of the Nail and McGregor data suggests that a conservative shift occurred on only some of their residual items because only on these items were thoughts of 9/11/01 primed by first asking participants their attitude toward Bush. Shifts in political attitudes may sometimes depend upon priming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Results indicating that high stem tones realizing word accents activate a certain class of suffixes in online processing of Central Swedish are presented. This supports the view that high Swedish word accent tones are induced onto word stems by particular suffixes rather than being associated with words in the mental lexicon. Using event-related potentials, effects of mismatch between word accents and inflectional suffixes were compared with mismatches between stem and suffix in terms of declension class. Declensionally incorrect suffixes yielded an increase in the N400, indicating problems in lexical retrieval, as well as a P600 effect, showing reanalysis. Both declensionally correct and incorrect high tone-inducing (Accent 2) suffixes combined with a mismatching low tone (Accent 1) on the stems produced P600 effects, but did not increase the N400. Suffixes usually co-occurring with Accent 1 did not yield any effects in words realized with the nonmatching Accent 2, suggesting that Accent 1 is a default accent, lacking association with any particular suffix. High tones on Accent 2 words also produced an early anterior positivity, interpreted as a P200 effect reflecting preattentive processing of the tone.

García-Pérez and Alcalá-Quintana overlook, however, fundamental properties of 2AFC psychometric functions and Type B order errors in their reanalysis.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 74(3) of Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics (see record [rid]2012-06023-003[/rid]). The original article contains an error that has some theoretical importance. The error lies in that asymptote parameters reflecting lapses or finger errors should not enter the constraint relating the psychometric functions that describe performance when the comparison stimulus in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) discrimination task is presented in the first or second interval. The error is also demonstrated in the erratum.] Lapid, Ulrich, and Rammsayer (see record [rid]2008-04948-010[/rid]) reported that estimates of the difference limen (DL) from a two- alternative forced choice (2AFC) task are higher than those obtained from a reminder task. This article reanalyzes their data in order to correct an error in their estimates of the DL from 2AFC data. We also extend the psychometric functions fitted to data from both tasks to incorporate an extra parameter that has been shown to allow obtaining accurate estimates of the DL that are unaffected by lapses. Contrary to Lapid et al.’s conclusion, our reanalysis shows that DLs estimated with the 2AFC task are only minimally (and not always significantly) larger than those estimated with the reminder task. We also show that their data are contaminated by response bias, and that the small remaining difference between DLs estimated with 2AFC and reminder tasks can be reasonably attributed to the differential effects that response bias has in either task as they were defined in Lapid et al.’s experiments. Finally, we discuss a novel approach presented by Ulrich and Vorberg (2009) for fitting psychometric functions to 2AFC discrimination data.

In response to our reanalysis and extension of Jacobs and Carmichael (2002) in which we found no evidence of a Black mayor effect, Jacobs (this issue) critiques our article on theoretical and methodological grounds. Theoretically, Jacobs argues that we did not provide sufficient justification for the inclusion of the percentage of the city council that was Black. Methodological criticisms include failure to include a nonlinear specification of percent divorced, improper temporal ordering, and the inclusion of only a single regional dummy variable. In our rejoinder we clarify the theoretical importance of the percentage of the city council that was Black and we address each of Jacobs’ methodological concerns. In additional analyses, we again find that the effect of the Black mayor variable is not robust to model specification or data employed, which was the point of our original article.

In a recent publication Kaminsky and Stucky (2009) claim our finding that the presence of a black mayor reduces killings of police officers (see Jacobs & Carmichael 2002) does not hold after they correct an error I made in the 2002 publication. Kaminsky and Stucky, however, ignore our most comprehensive models, which included a nonlinear specification with considerable explanatory power. They instead confine their reanalysis to a simplified and initial less exhaustive model in our paper that did not include the nonlinear specification without mentioning this and other omissions. After I correct my error, and retain the nonlinear specification that was in our definitive models, multiple versions of this model continue to support our hypothesis that the presence of a black mayor reduces killings of police officers. This comment concludes by outsome problems in Kaminski and Stucky’s analysis of later data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Deaf native signers have a general working memory (WM) capacity similar to that of hearing non-signers but are less sensitive to the temporal order of stored items at retrieval. General WM capacity declines with age, but little is known of how cognitive aging affects WM function in deaf signers. We investigated WM function in elderly deaf signers (EDS) and an age-matched comparison group of hearing non-signers (EHN) using a paradigm designed to highlight differences in temporal and spatial processing of item and order information. EDS performed worse than EHN on both item and order recognition using a temporal style of presentation. Reanalysis together with earlier data showed that with the temporal style of presentation, order recognition performance for EDS was also lower than for young adult deaf signers. Older participants responded more slowly than younger participants. These findings suggest that apart from age-related slowing irrespective of sensory and language status, there is an age-related difference specific to deaf signers in the ability to retain order information in WM when temporal processing demands are high. This may be due to neural reorganization arising from sign language use. Concurrent spatial information with the Mixed style of presentation resulted in enhanced order processing for all groups, suggesting that concurrent temporal and spatial cues may enhance learning for both deaf and hearing groups. These findings support and extend the WM model for Ease of Language Understanding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background/Context: The Equality of Educational Opportunity study is widely recognized as one of the most important studies on schooling ever performed. The findings from the report have shaped the field of education, national education policies, and wider public and scholarly opinion regarding the contributions of schools and schooling to equality and productivity in the United States. Despite past reanalyses of the data and decades of research on the effects of schools as organizations, the report’s fundamental finding—that a student’s family background is far more important than school social composition and school resources for understanding student outcomes—still retains much of its currency. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Using the original Equality of Educational Opportunity data, this study replicated Coleman’s statistical models but also applied a two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) to measure the effects of school-level social composition, resources, teacher characteristics, and peer characteristics on ninth-grade students’ verbal achievement. Research Design: HLM allows researchers to disentangle how schools and students’ family backgrounds contribute to learning outcomes. The methodology offers a clearer interpretation of the relative effects of school characteristics, including racial/ethnic composition, and family background, including race/ethnicity and social class, on students’ academic outcomes. Findings/Results: Our results suggest that schools do indeed matter, in that when one examines the outcomes across the national sample of schools, fully 40% of the differences in achievement can be found between schools. Even after statistically taking into account students’ family background, a large proportion of the variation among true school means is related to differences explained by school characteristics. Within-school inequalities in the achievement outcomes for African American and White students and students from families of higher and lower social class are explained in part by teachers’ biases favoring middle-class students and by schools’ greater reliance on curriculum differentiation through the use of academic and nonacademic tracking. Conclusions/Recommendations: Formal decomposition of the variance attributable to individual background and the social composition of the schools suggests that going to a high-poverty school or a highly segregated African American school has a profound effect on a student’s achievement outcomes, above and beyond the effect of individual poverty or minority status. Specifically, both the racial/ethnic and social class composition of a student’s school are 1 3/4 times more important than a student’s individual race/ethnicity or social class for understanding educational outcomes.

Abstract = {This study aims to add to the growing research related to the implementation of non-traditional writing tasks in classrooms to encourage science literacy. A secondary reanalysis methodology was employed to review student interviews collected as a part of several individual studies during a ten year research program. This method established an interpretive framework different than the particular frameworks guiding the individual studies. In doing so, a greater ability to generalize findings was sought. Main assertions emerging from the student responses analyzed include recognition of benefits of non-traditional writing, recognition of the need for particular task characteristics to encourage these benefits, and recognition of greater cognitive activity than is present in typical science classroom writing.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by L. D. Nelson & J. P. Simmons (see record [rid]2007-18215-015[/rid]). The authors reported that peoples' initials negatively affect their various performances. As their first data set is publicly available, reanalysis was conducted. Their first data set was Major League Baseball statistics. They claimed that players with the 1st or last initial K strike out more than those with other initials. Their results were also reported on popular media. However, some researchers may be skeptical about it, and lay people also expressed skepticism. Inconceivable as it sounds, however, given its very small p value, one should not deny it outright. However, it is very well known among baseball fans that the baseball statistics are inhomogeneous across years. Recognizing this inhomogeneity, they conducted some additional analyses, and still obtained significant results. However, as their statistical methods presume linearity, other approaches should be taken as well. This brief note should not just be perceived as a light-hearted reading to comfort baseball managers in the draft, but should prompt psychologists to have a serious thought on publication bias.

Abstract = {Armstrong and Vogel (2009) proposed that the differences between self-efficacy and interests are a matter of measurement artifact rather than substance. In tests of this hypothesis, they conceived of self-efficacy and interest as observed indicators of larger RIASEC (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional) types and as response method factors. We revisit the authors’ theoretical assumptions, measurement procedures, analyses, and interpretation of findings. When viewing this study in the context of the larger literature, we find ample support for the construal of self-efficacy and interests as distinct but related constructs. In addition, we examine the authors’ reanalysis of earlier longitudinal findings, reaching different conclusions than they did about the nature of the temporal relations among the social cognitive variables. Ultimately, whether one wishes to highlight or minimize the differences between interest and self-efficacy may largely depend on whether one’s purpose is explanation (e.g., how do people make career-relevant choices?) or classification (e.g., which RIASEC type does a person most resemble?).

Abstract = {In this article, I review the diagnostic criteria for Gender Identity Disorder (GID) in children as they were formulated in the DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV. The article focuses on the cumulative evidence for diagnostic reliability and validity. It does not address the broader conceptual discussion regarding GID as “disorder,” as this issue is addressed in a companion article by Meyer-Bahlburg (2009). This article addresses criticisms of the GID criteria for children which, in my view, can be addressed by extant empirical data. Based in part on reanalysis of data, I conclude that the persistent desire to be of the other gender should, in contrast to DSM-IV, be a necessary symptom for the diagnosis. If anything, this would result in a tightening of the diagnostic criteria and may result in a better separation of children with GID from children who display marked gender variance, but without the desire to be of the other gender.

However, Stalder and Baron did not consider the two orthogonal subfactors of NFC, decisiveness and need for structure (Neuberg, Judice, & West, 1997). A reanalysis of the original data showed that need for structure predicted dissonance-produced attitude change whereas decisiveness attenuated it. In addition, only decisiveness related to two other modes of dissonance reduction (trivialization and external justification).

Abstract = {Reanalyses of data from experiments on telepathic communication of emotions, as evoked by slide pictures, between groups of senders and groups of receivers are reported. In the present study, variability in performance rather than level of performance was in focus. Fits between variability in distributions of hits expected by chance and variability in empirical distributions were explored. The expected distributions were derived by means of the hypergeometric distribution, which provides the number of successes in a sequence of n draws from a finite population without replacement. Session level analyses showed that the variability in hit-rate was smaller than that expected by chance, particularly when the session groups who started as senders and those who started as receivers were analyzed separately and when the geomagnetic activity was low. Monte Carlo analyses indicated that these results could not be explained by stacking effects. Individual level analyses did not show any effects. In a second part of the study, the variability of responses to the individual target pictures was explored. The variability differed significantly among the pictures. Simulation showed that this effect was not attributable to stacking effects. Two predictions to be tested in an ongoing replication experiment are presented.

Abstract = {Empirical evidence demonstrating that sentence meaning is rapidly reconciled with the visual environment has been broadly construed as supporting the seamless interaction of visual and linguistic representations during situated comprehension. Based on recent behavioral and neuroscientific findings, however, we argue for the more deeply rooted coordination of the mechanisms underlying visual and linguistic processing, and for jointly considering the behavioral and neural correlates of scene–sentence reconciliation during situated comprehension. The Coordinated Interplay Account (CIA; Knoeferle, P., & Crocker, M. W. (2007). The influence of recent scene events on spoken comprehension: Evidence from eye movements. Journal of Memory and Language, 57(4), 519–543) asserts that incremental linguistic interpretation actively directs attention in the visual environment, thereby increasing the salience of attended scene information for comprehension. We review behavioral and neuroscientific findings in support of the CIA’s three processing stages: (i) incremental sentence interpretation, (ii) language-mediated visual attention, and (iii) the on-line influence of non-linguistic visual context. We then describe a recently developed connectionist model which both embodies the central CIA proposals and has been successfully applied in modeling a range of behavioral findings from the visual world paradigm (Mayberry, M. R., Crocker, M. W., & Knoeferle, P. (2009). Learning to attend: A connectionist model of situated language comprehension. Cognitive Science). Results from a new simulation suggest the model also correlates with event-related brain potentials elicited by the immediate use of visual context for linguistic disambiguation (Knoeferle, P., Habets, B., Crocker, M. W., & Münte, T. F. (2008). Visual scenes trigger immediate syntactic reanalysis: Evidence from ERPs during situated spoken comprehension. Cerebral Cortex, 18(4), 789–795). Finally, we argue that the mechanisms underlying interpretation, visual attention, and scene apprehension are not only in close temporal synchronization, but have co-adapted to optimize real-time visual grounding of situated spoken language, thus facilitating the association of linguistic, visual and motor representations that emerge during the course of our embodied linguistic experience in the world.

Abstract = {Recent studies show that when words are correlated with the colours they are printed in (e.g., MOVE is presented 75% of the time in blue), colour identification is faster when the word is presented in its correlated colour (MOVE in blue) than in an uncorrelated colour (MOVE in green). The present series of experiments explored the possible mechanisms involved in this colour-word contingency learning effect. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the effect is already present after 18 learning trials. During subsequent unlearning, the effect extinguished equally rapidly. Two reanalyses of data from Schmidt, Crump, Cheesman, and Besner (2007) ruled out an account of the effect in terms of stimulus repetitions. Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants who carry a memory load do not show a contingency effect, supporting the hypothesis that limited-capacity resources are required for learning. Experiment 3 demonstrated that memory resources are required for both storage and retrieval processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

These analyses suggest the presence of strong genetic correlations between cerebral structures, particularly between regions of like tissue type or in spatial proximity. Structural modeling estimated that most of the variance in all structures is associated with highly correlated lobar latent factors, with differences in genetic covariance and heritability driven by a common genetic factor that influenced gray and white matter differently.

Abstract = {The Wason selection task, a standard test of conditional reasoning, has featured prominently in experimental studies of cognitive adaptations for cooperation. The most prominent of these is Cosmides' investigations of cheater detection on social contract versions of the Wason selection task [Cognition 31 (1989) 187–276]. Subsequent to Cosmides' initial investigations, several researchers [Evol Hum Behav 21 (200) 25–37; Manage Decis Econ 19 (1998) 467–480; J Genet Psychol 163 (2002) 425–444; Evol Hum Behav 27 (2006) 366–380] have argued that people also are competent at detecting altruism on the Wason selection task, suggesting that there is nothing privileged about the detection of cheaters. However, an analysis of the selection tasks on which these claims are based suggests that participants may have solved these altruism-detection tasks correctly because the scenarios explicitly or implicitly provide the answer to the task in the scenario [Evol Hum Behav 21 (200) 25–37; Manage Decis Econ 19 (1998) 467–480; J Genet Psychol 163 (2002) 425–444], or due to confounds in the cheater-detection tasks leading to the (misleading) appearance of enhanced altruist-detection performance [Evol Hum Behav 27 (2006) 366–380]. We tested our conjecture by giving participants selection tasks with and without the answer embedded in the scenario. Performance dropped significantly on the altruism-detection tasks when the embedded answers were removed, whereas performance on cheater-detection versions was unaffected by the manipulation. A reanalysis of the findings of Oda et al. suggested that participants performed significantly worse on their altruism-detection problems than their cheater-detection problems—a finding that we replicate after removing confounds from the cheater-detection tasks of Oda et al. The results reaffirm the specificity of cheater-detection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant treatment: Reanalysis of the randomized placebo-controlled studies of fluoxetine and venlafaxine" by Robert D. Gibbons, C. Hendricks Brown, Kwan Hur, John M. Davis and J. John Mann (JAMA Psychiatry, 2012[Jun], Vol 69[6], 580-587). For the original article, included the following statement: "A detailed description of the study data is available on request from the authors and will be available in a related publication." While a general overview of the studies was provided in the companion article (Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2012;69[6]:572-579), the authors have responded to requests for additional information. For clarification, the following sentence has been added to the article. "In addition, an eTable with the detailed study data and an eList of publications for the studies included in the article are available as supplementary online content (at jamapsychiatry.com)." (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-03110-011[/rid]). Context: The US Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for antidepressants and suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and young adults. Objective: To determine the short-term safety of antidepressants by standard assessments of suicidal thoughts and behavior in youth, adult, and geriatric populations and the mediating effect of changes in depressive symptoms. Data Sources: All intent-to-treat person-level longitudinal data of major depressive disorder from 12 adult, 4 geriatric, and 4 youth randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine hydrochloride and 21 adult trials of venlafaxine hydrochloride. Study Selection: All sponsor-conducted randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine. Data Extraction: The suicide items from the Children’s Depression Rating Scale–Revised and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as well as adverse event reports of suicide attempts and suicide during active treatment were analyzed in 9185 patients (fluoxetine: 2635 adults, 960 geriatric patients, 708 youths; venlafaxine: 2421 adults with immediate-release venlafaxine and 2461 adults with extended-release venlafaxine) for a total of 53 260 person-week observations. Data Synthesis: Suicidal thoughts and behavior decreased over time for adult and geriatric patients randomized to fluoxetine or venlafaxine compared with placebo, but no differences were found for youths. In adults, reduction in suicide ideation and attempts occurred through a reduction in depressive symptoms. In all age groups, severity of depression improved with medication and was significantly related to suicide ideation or behavior. Conclusions: Fluoxetine and venlafaxine decreased suicidal thoughts and behavior for adult and geriatric patients. This protective effect is mediated by decreases in depressive symptoms with treatment. For youths, no significant effects of treatment on suicidal thoughts and behavior were found, although depression responded to treatment. No evidence of increased suicide risk was observed in youths receiving active medication. To our knowledge, this is the first research synthesis of suicidal thoughts and behavior in depressed patients treated with antidepressants that examined the mediating role of depressive symptoms using complete longitudinal person-level data from a large set of published and unpublished studies.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by M. J. Brandt (see record [rid]2011-26192-010[/rid]). In a recent research report, Brandt suggests that sexist ideologies predict increases in gender inequality at the country level. Using advanced multilevel modeling methods, the author combined aggregated individual-level data on sexism (N > 80,000) from the World Values Survey (World Values Survey Association, 2009) with country-level data on gender inequality (N < 60) from United Nations Human Development Reports. We were curious and plotted the sexism effect based on the data printed in the article. Our reanalysis casts serious doubts on Brandt’s (2011) conclusion. We are not suggesting that it would have been better for these influential cases to have been deleted. However, they should have been discussed so that readers could assess the robustness of the effect. Furthermore, unusual cases often tell their own important stories, which may critically inform future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Age-related deficits in low-level inhibitory motor control" by Friederike Schlaghecken, Kulbir S. Birak and Elizabeth A. Maylor (Psychology and Aging, 2011[Dec], Vol 26[4], 905-918). The authors discovered that the method proposed for individually extracting priming effects from time course analysis may lead to some spurious effects. In view of possible spurious effects from their application of time course analysis, the authors adopted an alternative strategy that retains their attempt to take an individual approach to identifying NCEs in older participants who may vary more than young participants in terms of the prime-target SOA at which NCEs initially appear. This reanalysis is presented in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-10375-001[/rid].) Inhibitory control functions in old age were investigated with the “masked prime” paradigm in which participants executed speeded manual choice responses to simple visual targets. These were preceded—either immediately or at some earlier time—by a backward-masked prime. Young adults produced positive compatibility effects (PCEs)—faster and more accurate responses for matching than for nonmatching prime-target pairs—when prime and target immediately followed each other, and the reverse effect (negative compatibility effect, NCE) for targets that followed the prime after a short interval. Older adults produced similar PCEs to young adults, indicating intact low-level motor activation, but failed to produce normal NCEs even with longer delays (Experiment 1), increased opportunity for prime processing (Experiment 2), and prolonged learning (Experiment 3). However, a fine-grained analysis of each individual's time course of masked priming effects revealed NCEs in the majority of older adults, of the same magnitude as those of young adults. These were significantly delayed (even more than expected on the basis of general slowing), indicating a disproportionate impairment of low-level inhibitory motor control in old age.

Abstract = {Since the classic descriptions of the course of bipolar and recurrent depressive forms of manic-depressive illness by Emil Kraepelin a century ago, it has been considered a truism that the rate of cycling increases, and wellness intervals shorten, with rising counts of recurrences, particularly early in the natural history of the illness. Less well known is that the analysis of this phenomenon is vulnerable to a computational artifact first described by Eliot Slater, based on his reanalysis of data from manic-depressive patients first evaluated by Kraepelin at the Munich Psychiatric Institute. Slater realized that there is an increasingly disproportionate representation of faster-cycling patients in sub-samples involving higher cycle-counts in pooled samples of subjects. More accurate results require analyzing illness-course either within individuals, or in groups matched for episode-counts. This artifact is pervasive in the older and modern research literature, but still not widely recognized. Since Slater's 1938 report in German is not well known, we provide an abbreviated English translation with commentary and additional reanalysis to highlight the phenomenon that might be termed 'Slater's Fallacy'.

Abstract = {The regulatory agencies of different European countries and the U. S. have published statements and warnings concerning a possibly increased risk of suicidality associated with the use of antidepressants in pediatric patients. The evidence base for the efficacy of most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants in children and adolescents is lacking or less broad and less convincing than for adults. For methodological reasons it might be hard to prove. For adults, there is a considerable risk that undertreatment of depression has increased due to the negative publicity associated with antidepressants. SSRIs, as mostly non-sedating antidepressants, have been associated with increases of suicidality in case reports and were initially in the focus of attention in the reanalyses of the pediatric studies with antidepressants. However more systematic and broader reanalyses of published and unpublished randomized controlled trials led the "Psychopharmacologic Drug and Pediatric Advisory Committee" to conclude that the finding of an increased risk of suicidality in pediatric patients applied not only to SSRI but also to other drugs studied including sedating ones such as mirtazapine.

Abstract = {Comment by the current authors on findings of their original study (see record [rid]2007-09891-007[/rid]), and similar research by Miller et al. (see record [rid]2012-06616-033[/rid]) and Gibbons et al. (see record [rid]2012-06616-008[/rid]). In a groundbreaking prospective study involving data from the 1986 to 1994 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) linked to the 1986 to 1997 National Death Index (NDI), Kaplan et al. showed that men who served in the military were twice as likely as were nonveterans to complete suicide even after adjustment for numerous established suicide risk factors. However, some studies have found no connection between military service and suicide. Findings may vary because analyses of the risk of suicide among veterans have differed in statistical methods (e.g., standardized mortality ratio versus relative risk), inclusion of confounders, representativeness of the samples, and military branch or exposure to combat. Moreover, nearly all survival analyses used the date of a particular survey as the time of origin, a far less precise measure than discharge date. Using expanded linked NHIS–NDI data to include a longer follow-up period, Miller et al. found that veterans were not at a significantly higher risk of suicide than were nonveterans in the general population after adjusting for a limited number of covariates (race, age, and survey years). The longer follow-up appears to weaken the relative risk of suicide because a reanalysis using a shorter period shows that veterans have a significantly higher suicide hazard than do nonveterans. Gibbons et al. confirmed this finding and suggested that the discrepancy may be partially explained by age differences possibly associated with variation in service era and exposure to combat. Thus, more needs to be learned about aspects of service that may put veterans at a higher risk of suicide. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by P. Bech et al. (see record [rid]2013-08892-008[/rid]). Bech et al. presented an independent reanalysis of data from the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study, which suggested that escitalopram may be superior to nortriptyline in its effect on core depressive symptoms. This differs from the conclusion made by the authors that the two antidepressants do not differ in overall antidepressant efficacy. The present analysis conducted by the authors and the study conducted by Bech et al. differed in several important respects. First, Bech et al. decided to focus exclusively on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), although it was the scale with the least satisfactory psychometric properties. Second, Bech et al. excluded individuals with incomplete baseline data on any scale, leading to a reduced sample of 765. Third, Bech et al. defined remission as a score of five or less on a six-item core subscale of HRSD. Bech et al. reported results stratified by baseline HRSD and omitted 38 individuals who they classified as doubtful depression. It is likely that these differences in analytic approach fully explain why the results of Bech et al. are at variance with the results of Bech et al.

For the article, Drs.

Lin and Tomlinson and is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-12662-001[/rid].) We propose 2 related models for the meta-analysis of diagnostic tests. Both models are based on the bivariate normal distribution for transformed sensitivities and false-positive rates. Instead of using the logit as a transformation for these proportions, we employ the tα family of transformations that contains the log, logit, and (approximately) the complementary log. A likelihood ratio test for the cutoff value problem is developed, and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves are discussed. Worked examples showcase the methodology. We compare the models to the hierarchical SROC model, which in contrast employs a logit transformation. Data from various meta-analyses are reanalyzed, and the reanalysis indicates a better performance of the models based on the tα transformation.

Abstract = {An ad hoc poll of analysts in study groups, at meetings, and in conversations, indicated that a number had more than one analysis. (Some, of course, had a personal analysis prior to training, so that the training analysis was a reanalysis.) Those who had reanalyses felt the experience contributed substantially to the quality of their work and lives. Those self-assessments appeared borne out by work that seemed more attuned to the patient, directed toward understanding process, and facilitating of the development and understanding of transference, resistance, and countertransference. That work also seemed less doctrinaire, conveying vitality and life without being wild. The benefits of reanalysis did not seem to correlate with theoretical orientation. It made little difference whether the analyst's work was conceptualized within ego psychological, conflict, self-psychological, intersubjective, or object relations frameworks. It seemed that the theoretical framework of the "reanalysand" and the "reanalyst" did not matter as much as the additional, personal psychoanalytic experience.

Consequently, these articles are hereby retracted.] Three experiments with rats used conditioned suppression of barpress to test predictions of the extended comparator hypothesis, which assumes that the effectiveness of (first-order) comparator stimuli in modulating responding to a target conditioned stimulus (CS) is itself modulated by other (second-order) comparator stimuli. Experiment 1 demonstrated that both pretraining exposure to the target CS alone and pretraining exposure to a compound of the target CS and nontarget CS counteract overshadowing, and that posttraining deflation of the overshadowing stimulus attenuates responding to the target CS when overshadowing is preceded by a CS-preexposure treatment, but not when overshadowing is preceded by a compound-CS-preexposure treatment. Experiment 2 examined the consequences of posttraining associative inflation of the overshadowing stimulus or the preexposure companion stimulus following conjoint compound-CS-preexposure and overshadowing treatment. Experiment 3 examined the consequences of posttraining inflation of the overshadowing stimulus or the context following conjoint CS-alone preexposure and overshadowing treatment. The results support the expression-focused comparator view in contrast to recent acquisition-focused models of retrospective revaluation.

Abstract = {Presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The current authors disagree with this particular analysis and the conclusion. They believe the original authors' conclusion to be based on a statistically unsatisfactory procedure. However, their critique applies only to the comparison of familiar and unfamiliar callers. The overall hit rate of the entire experiment remains untouched by the following reanalysis.

He also wishes to express his gratitude to Escobar and Urcelay for their assistance in the reanalysis of the data.] Increases in conditioned responding to a target stimulus achieved through posttraining extinction of a former companion stimulus (deflation) have proven moderately easy to obtain. In contrast, reductions in responding to a target as a result of posttraining pairings of its companion with the outcome (inflation) have proven more elusive. It has been suggested that stimuli with high biological significance (i.e., high response potential) are partially protected against inflation-mediated reductions in responding. Three conditioned suppression studies with rats systematically compared the consequences of posttraining inflation and deflation of companion stimuli. Experiment 1 replicated the previously observed asymmetries. Experiment 2 showed that inflation and deflation effects are symmetrical when target stimuli are of relatively low biological significance during training. Experiment 3 suggested that a biologically significant stimulus is also protected against reductions in its potential to act as an effective comparator stimulus. These findings challenge many contemporary theories of associative learning, particularly those designed to account for retrospective revaluation.

Abstract = {In this paper, we present experimental evidence for the existence of syntax-independent (viz. thematic) reanalysis effects. In an experiment using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we manipulated the thematic structure of the verb in transitive, unambiguously case marked German verb-final clauses such that the processing of this verb either confirmed the 'canonical' hierarchical thematic ordering between the sentential arguments (active verbs) or required a reversal of this ordering (object-experiencer verbs). The latter elicited a parietal positivity between 300 and 600 ms post onset, which, as we argue, must be interpreted as reflecting a thematic reanalysis. The second experimental manipulation, i.e., a variation of word order (SO vs. OS), revealed an early positivity at the position of the second NP in dative-nominative (OS) structures. Again, we account for this effect in terms of a thematic reanalysis, which becomes necessary when the original interpretation of the initial argument as thematically highest-ranking must be revised. We conclude from our data that case marking languages such as German may employ non-syntactic processing routes to determine the thematic interpretation of a sentence.

In these cases, a reanalysis process is necessary in order to correct the mental representation built up to that point. It has been previously proposed that readers obey a minimum change restriction, as they prefer to change the mental representation as little as possible. The present paper reports two experiments in Japanese suggesting that a minimal change restriction is unnecessary to characterize reanalysis.

Abstract = {My colleagues and I published a series of three articles (1994, 1995, and 1996) on the assessment of object relations in abused children. All three studies used the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scales to score Ss' responses to the Thematic Apperception Test. The data on which these articles were based were extracted from an archive that contained social history and psychological testing information on various clinical samples of children and their families. Members of my research team had access to these data for degree-related research projects. Recently, I became aware that there was not an adequate system of checks in place to prevent the reuse of data for some of these projects. This oversight resulted in participant overlap among the samples reported in these studies. The sample overlap in these studies means that the results are not truly independent. To correct and clarify the implications of these errors, this article offers a reanalysis of the data for the unique Ss included in the three original articles. Results of the reanalysis are consistent with the conclusions derived from the original articles, indicating that childhood sexual and physical abuse are associated with object relations impairments in girls from an outpatient community mental health setting.

Abstract = {This event-related brain potential study assessed the interplay of syntactic and semantic information. The study focused on the N400 component, related to semantic integration, and the SPS/P600 component, related to syntactic reanalysis. 30 German subjects (Ss; mean age 23 yrs) read sentences in which a referent was introduced. Later a personal pronoun was presented which either agreed with the referent in terms of syntactic gender, or in terms of biological gender, or both, or violated both agreements. Results show salient P600 effects for pronouns. This indicates that the establishment of reference involves syntactic reanalysis. N400 effects were observed in sentences with nondiminutives, but not with diminutives. This shows that conceptual/semantic integration is involved during non-diminutive but not during diminutive pronoun processing, or at least it could not be violated. It is concluded that the overall pattern of results supports the claim that for non-diminutives, both syntactic and conceptual information is used to establish co-reference, while for diminutives the process might be purely syntactically driven.

Reanalyses of previous studies with different species suggest that pro- and anticholinergic drugs influence initial discriminability in delayed matching-to-sample performance, but not rate of forgetting. The results of the authors' reanalyses are consistent with the conclusion that the cholinergic system plays a role in the encoding component of working memory and that this is the main characteristic of the memory deficit shown by patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract = {In an eye movement experiment, we examined the use of reanalysis strategies during the reading of locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous Spanish sentences. Among other measures, we examined regressive eye movements made while readers were recovering in reading mild garden path sentences. The sentences had an adverbial clause that, depending on the mood (indicative vs. subjunctive) of the subordinate clause verb, could attach high (to the main verb of the sentence) or low (to the verb in the subordinate clause). Although Spanish speakers favor low attachment, the high attachment version was quite easy to understand. Readers predominately used two alternative strategies to recover from the mild garden path in our sentences. In the more common reanalysis strategy, their eyes regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the main verb in the sentence. Following this, they reread the rest of the sentence, fixating the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence). Less frequently, readers regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the adverb. We argue that both types of strategies are consistent with a selective reanalysis process.

The reanalysis revealed that the advantage on inflectional morphology for children with language impairment was only on the progressive suffix, not on plural and possessive or on the verbal morphemes third-person present tense and past tense. The resolution of these discrepant results highlights the critical roles that methodological issues play--specifically, how Ss are matched on MLU, how inflectional morphology is measured, and the selection of Ss with regard to age.

Abstract = {Although a great deal of research has investigated the factors affecting initial syntactic processing, little is known about the factors that affect processing during reanalysis. To address this question, we report a self-paced reading and an eye-tracking experiment which tested sentences in which there is initially more than one way for reanalysis to proceed, but where this choice is eventually disambiguated by a gender-marked reflexive (like The photographers found the countess who heard the choirboy had really enjoyed himself/herself at the concert in the town hall). Ss were participants and college students in Glasgow. The experiments provide evidence that the human sentence processing mechanism obeys a recency preference in reanalysis. This suggests that at least some of the factors guiding reanalysis are similar to those guiding initial analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the extent to which existing structural commitments constrain the human parser's search for grammatical analyses of incoming material, specifically whether a Reanalysis As a Last Resort (RALR) strategy applies to sentence parsing. 64 undergraduate students participated in two self-paced reading experiments which investigate this issue using a structural ambiguity in which a local, easy reanalysis is pitted against a nonlocal attachment requiring no reanalysis. This ambiguity is created by embedding classic noun phrase/sentential complement ambiguities inside a relative clause modifying a subject NP. The results of both experiments indicate that readers' existing structural commitments do constrain their subsequent parsing decisions: nonlocal analyses which avoid reanalysis are consistently favored over local analyses which require an easy reanalysis. This conclusion is confirmed by the results of a subcategorization-bias manipulation in Experiment 2, which shows that readers show a consistent bias to avoid reanalysis, rather than a general bias for either local or matrix clause attachments.

Abstract = {During language comprehension, people sometimes have to revise their grammatical analysis of a sentence. Experimental evidence demonstrates that such reanalysis often causes processing difficulty. We might therefore predict that reanalysis would be disfavored, with the processor preferring not to reanalyze when it had a choice. Three experiments on complement–clause ambiguities investigate the conditions under which the processor chooses to reanalyze. We contrast two extreme positions, one where the processor avoids reanalysis whenever possible, the other where reanalysis is not disfavored at all. We also consider intermediate positions, in which the preference to maintain the current analysis is one factor that affects ambiguity resolution. The experiments demonstrate that the processor avoids reanalysis even when other factors would support it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Specifically they examined the conditions under which part of the initial incorrect analysis persists at the same time that part of the correct final analysis is constructed. Ss were college students and native speakers of English. In Experiments 1a and 1b, they found that both the length of the ambiguous region and the plausibility of the ultimate interpretation affected the likelihood that such sentences would be fully reanalyzed. In Experiment 2, the authors compared garden path sentences with non-garden path sentences and compared performance on 2 different types of comprehension questions. In Experiments 3a and 3b, they constructed garden path sentences using a small class of syntactically unique verbs to provide converging evidence against the position that people employ some sort of "general reasoning" or pragmatic inference when faced with syntactically difficult garden paths. The results from these experiments indicate that reanalysis of such sentences is not always complete, so that comprehenders often derive an interpretation for the full sentence in which part of the initial misanalysis persists.

Abstract = {Theories of sentence comprehension have addressed both initial parsing processes and mechanisms responsible for reanalysis. Three experiments are summarized that were designed to investigate the reanalysis and interpretation of relatively difficult garden-path sentences (e.g., While Anna dressed the baby spit up on the bed). After reading such sentences, participants correctly believed that the baby spit up on the bed; however, they often confidently, yet incorrectly, believed that Anna dressed the baby. These results demonstrate that garden-path reanalysis is not an all-or-nothing process and that thematic roles initially assigned for the subordinate clause verb are not consistently revised. The implications of the partial reanalysis phenomenon of reanalysis and sentence processing are discussed. In addition, the authors discuss the possibility that language processing often creates "good enough" structures rather than ideal structures.

The sophistication that dogs show in using human communicative cues led researchers to investigate the origins of these abilities and to conclude that these social skills are not simply inherited from wolves nor are they simply learned as a result of exposure to humans in ontogeny, but rather they have evolved as a result of domestication. Recently, two papers challenge the ideas (1) that dogs outperform wolves in using human communicative gestures and (2) that dogs require very limited human exposure to show initial skill in using such communicative cues. In the first of these studies, Udell et al. present findings suggesting that wolves are more skilled than dogs in using human communicative cues in a food retrieval task. Specifically they found that wolves were more skilled than shelter dogs and pet dogs tested outdoors, and equally as skilled as pet dogs tested indoors. Based on our reanalysis and new experiment, we do not believe that Udell et al. or Wynne et al. provide compelling evidence that challenges the domestication hypothesis. Therefore, in conclusion, we suggest that the findings we have available now remain completely consistent with the hypothesis that the unusual skills of domestic dogs in using human communicative cues most likely evolved during and as a result of human domestication.

For this purpose, an extension of latent difference models (McArdle, 1988; Steyer, Eid, & Schwenkmezger, 1997) to multiple constructs and multiple methods is presented. The model allows investigators to separate true change from measurement error and to analyze change simultaneously for different methods. The authors also show how Campbell and Fiske’s (1959) guidelines for analyzing convergent and discriminant validity can be applied to the measurement of latent change. The practical application of the multimethod change model is illustrated in a reanalysis of child depression and anxiety scores (N = 906 American children) that were assessed by self- and parent reports on three measurement occasions. The analyses revealed that (a) the convergent validity of change was low for both constructs and (b) sex was a significant predictor of self-reported, but not of parent reported, anxiety states. Finally, the authors discuss advantages and limitations and compare the model with other approaches for analyzing longitudinal MTMM data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Several studies have reported that traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a smaller effect on neuropsychological test scores, in contrast to the large effect of poor effort on test performance. Consequently, many authors have concluded that effort needs to be measured routinely and that it is necessary to control for poor effort when measuring the effects of brain disease or injury on performance. Recently, however, Bowden, Shores, and Mathias (2006) have challenged these notions. They argued that the Immediate Recognition subtest of the Word Memory Test (Green & Flaro, 2003), an effort measure, is another verbal memory test rather than a measure of cognitive effort. In this study we re-examine the data from Bowden et al. (2006) and Green, Rohling, Lees-Haley, and Allen (2001) to identify differences between the two studies that might account for their contradictory conclusions. In both sets of data, reanalysis showed that effort explains approximately five times more of the variance in composite neuropsychological test scores than TBI severity. Importantly, scores on the Word Memory Test—Immediate Recognition (WMT-IR) were not correlated with measures of TBI severity, and were not found to correlate with major variables known to be measuring ability (e.g., years of education). These findings challenge the conclusions offered by Bowden and colleagues (2006). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

A national survey asked 1,000 U.S. adults to report the number of lies told in a 24-hour period. Sixty percent of subjects report telling no lies at all, and almost half of all lies are told by only 5% of subjects; thus, prevalence varies widely and most reported lies are told by a few prolific liars. The pattern is replicated in a reanalysis of previously published research and with a student sample. Substantial individual differences in lying behavior have implications for the generality of truth—lie base rates in deception detection experiments.

Feinberg. 2010. Alleviating the constant stochastic variance assumption in decision research: Theory, measurement, and experimental test. Marketing Sci. 29(1) 1–17] for the process of model development and testing in the field of intertemporal choice analysis is explored. Although supporting the overall thrust of Salisbury and Feinberg’s critique of previous empirical work in the area, we also see their paper as illustrating the dangers of drawing strong inferences about the behavioral interpretation of statistical model parameters without seeking convergent empirical evidence. In particular, we are skeptical about the extent to which the reported effects of temporal distance on the estimated scale parameter, σc , are uniquely, or even primarily, due to unobserved error inflation that reflects consumer’s uncertainty about future utility. This interpretation is brought into question by several lines of reasoning. Conceptually, we note that “uncertainty” is different from “error” and that, for choice data, the error inflation model is mathematically identical to a model in which the scale parameter is a deterministic function of the temporal discount rate. Empirically, a reanalysis of data from previously published experiments does not consistently support temporal error inflation, temporal convergence of choice shares, or the scale parameter as an explanation of variety seeking in choice sequences. In our opinion, the cumulative results of research on intertemporal choice require models in which the attributes of choice alternatives are differentially discounted over time. Despite these findings, we advocate that choice researchers should indeed follow Salisbury and Feinberg’s advice to not assume that error variances will be unaffected by experimental manipulations, and such effects should be explicitly modeled. We also agree that uncovering effects on error variance is just the first step, and the ultimate goal should be to rigorously explain the reasons for such effects.

Abstract = {Regression models for functional responses and scalar predictors are often fitted by means of basis functions, with quadratic roughness penalties applied to avoid over fitting. The fitting approach described by Ramsay and Silverman in the 1990s amounts to a penalized ordinary least squares (P-OLS) estimator of the coefficient functions. We recast this estimator as a generalized ridge regression estimator, and present a penalized generalized least squares (P-GLS) alternative. We describe algorithms by which both estimators can be implemented, with automatic selection of optimal smoothing parameters, in a more computationally efficient manner than has heretofore been available. We discuss point wise confidence intervals for the coefficient functions, simultaneous inference by permutation tests, and model selection, including a novel notion of point wise model selection. P-OLS and P-GLS are compared in a simulation study. Our methods are illustrated with an analysis of age effects in a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set, as well as a reanalysis of a now-classic Canadian weather data set.

The Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) initiative was spearheaded to identify the most important cognitive and affective domains relevant to schizophrenia and to optimize experimental tasks within those domains that possess adequate construct validity. The articles in this issue are the product of a meeting at which issues related to the development and implementation of biomarkers were discussed among experts in various neuroimaging and psychophysiological methods. Collectively, these articles address numerous obstacles that must be overcome to identify usable psychiatric biomarkers. Thus, during this challenging time, projects like CNTRICS provide opportunities to boost the return on scientific investments by extending the shelf life of research data through standardization, integration, sharing, and opportunities for reanalysis.

Abstract = {K. Rastle and M. Coltheart (1999; see also M. Coltheart & K. Rastle, 1994) reported data demonstrating that the cost of irregularity in reading aloud low-frequency exception words is modulated by the position of the irregularity in the word. They argued that these data implicated a serial process and falsified all models of reading aloud that operate solely in parallel, a conclusion that M. Zorzi (2000) challenged by successfully simulating the position of irregularity effect with such a model. Zorzi (2000) further claimed that a reanalysis of K. Rastle and A Coltheart's (1999) data demonstrates sensitivity to grapheme-phoneme consistency (which he claimed was confounded across the position of irregularity manipulation) rather than the use of a serial process. Here, the authors argue that M. Zorzi's (2000) reanalyses were inappropriate and reassert that K. Rastle and A Coltheart's (1999) findings are evidence for serial processing.

Abstract = {The P600 component in Event Related Potential research has been hypothesized to be associated with syntactic reanalysis processes. The authors, however, propose that the P600 is not restricted to reanalysis processes, but reflects difficulty with syntactic integration processes in general. First the authors discuss this integration hypothesis in terms of a sentence processing model proposed elsewhere. Next, in Exp 1, the authors show that, in 29 18–35 yr old Ss, the P600 is elicited in grammatical, non-garden path sentences in which integration is more difficult (i.e., "who" questions) relative to a control sentence ("whether" questions). This effect is replicated in Exp 2 (which used 36 17–35 yr old Ss). Furthermore, the authors directly compare the effect of difficult integration in grammatical sentences to the effect of agreement violations. The results suggest that the positivity elicited in "who" questions and the P600-effect elicited by agreement violations have partly overlapping neural generators. This supports the hypothesis that similar cognitive processes, i.e., integration, are involved in both 1st pass analysis of "who" questions and dealing with ungrammaticalities (reanalysis).

Abstract = {When the human parser encounters a local structural ambiguity, are multiple structures pursued (parallel or breadth-first parsing), or just a single preferred structure (serial or depth-first parsing)? This note discusses four important classes of serial and parallel models: simple limited parallel, ranked limited parallel, deterministic serial with reanalysis, and probabilistic serial with reanalysis. It is argued that existing evidence is compatible only with probabilistic serial-reanalysis models, or ranked parallel models augmented with a reanalysis component. A new class of linguistic structures is introduced on which the behavior of serial and parallel parsers diverge the most radically: multiple local ambiguities are stacked to increase the number of viable alternatives in the ambiguous region from two to eight structures. This paradigm may provide the strongest test yet for parallel models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this paper the authors discuss an asymmetry in the Case system of German and its implications for human sentence processing: the asymmetry between nominative/accusative and dative case. Starting from the assumption that dative case has a distinct grammatical representation, the results of two experiments (n = 64) will be presented, which show that dative assignment during reanalysis is accompanied by additional processing operations that are not needed when accusative or nominative are assigned. In particular, the authors show that dative assignment during reanalysis triggers reaccess to the mental lexicon, giving rise to greater processing difficulty. The authors conclude with a discussion of empirical and theoretical consequences of our findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {M. Meng and M. Bader (e.g., 1996) have presented evidence that a Case conflict is a more effective cue for garden path reanalysis than a number conflict is, for German wh-sentences with subject-object ambiguities. The preferred first-pass analysis has the wh-trace in subject position, although object position is correct. In a speeded grammaticality judgment task, perceivers accepted Case-disambiguated examples more often and more rapidly than number-disambiguated examples. For ungrammatical sentences, a Case mismatch error resulted in more false positive grammaticality judgments than a number mismatch error. The authors offer an explanation for why Case and number features differ in these two ways in their effects on sentence processing. They propose, within the Diagnosis Model of garden-path processing, that reanalysis triggered by a Case mismatch guides the parser more effectively toward the correct structure. Case is a positive symptom, which carries information about the new structure that must be built. By contrast, a number mismatch is a negative symptom. This difference in the transparency of garden-path repair can also account for the greater overacceptance of Case-disambiguated ungrammatical sentences.

Abstract = {The anatomic complexity of the brachial plexus makes its electrophysiological exploration difficult. Electrodiagnosis nevertheless plays a crucial role in assessing brachial plexopathies, particularly in the perspective of post-traumatic surgical reconstructions. The evaluation aims to locate as precisely as possible injuries within the plexus, as well as to determine their severity and capacity for recovery. This requires various sensory nerve conduction studies and needle EMG recordings of “marker” muscles. Plexopathies differ from radiculopathies by altered sensory nerve responses and unaltered functional innervation of paracervical muscles. We propose to simplify the exploration of brachial plexopathies by following some practical rules derived from a reanalysis of the brachial plexus anatomic sketch. Two main simplification rules can be deduced from an analysis of the anatomic sketch. First it would be judicious to associate the plexopathies involving a single element of the brachial plexus with distinct etiological and symptomatic patterns according to the altered element, as one does for peripheral nerve and root pathologies. The second proposal relies on the observation that each supraclavicular “truncal” element (upper, middle, or lower) of the brachial plexus results from reunion of cervical root nerves and behaves like a “super-root” for the upper limb, while each infraclavicular “cord” element (posterior, lateral, or medial) is the sum of two or more peripheral nerves and behaves like a “super-nerve”. Accordingly, the motor and sensory abnormalities associated with the lesion of a single plexus branch may occupy a clinical and electrophysiological territory that recovers those of its constituants. Except the unaltered paracervical muscles, it is useful to reduce the topographical semiology of truncal lesions to well-known cervical radiculopathies (upper trunk neuropathy to C5 and C6 associated radiculopathies, middle trunk neuropathy to C7 radiculopathy, lower trunk neuropathy to C8 and T1 associated radiculopathies); and that of cord lesions to well-known mononeuropathies of the upper limb (for example, a posterior cord neuropathy may be considered as a full radial mononeuropathy associated with an axillary one). This method of simplification allows to demystify the brachial plexopathies and to facilitate their comprehension and exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Constituent structure is considered to be the very foundation of linguistic competence and often considered to be innate, yet we show here that it is derivable from the domain-general processes of chunking and categorization. Using modern and diachronic corpus data, we show that the facts support a view of constituent structure as gradient (as would follow from its source in chunking and categorization) and subject to gradual changes over time. Usage factors (i.e., repetition) and semantic factors both influence chunking and categorization and, therefore, influence constituent structure. We take as our example the complex prepositions of English, for instance, on top of, in back of, and in spite of, whose internal constituent structure has been much debated. From observing strong (but not absolute) usage trends in the corpus data, we find that these complex preposition sequences display varying degrees of emerging constituency. We conclude that constituent reanalysis, like language change generally, proceeds gradually. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to a delay in response time (RT) to targets appearing at a previously cued location. The prevailing view is that IOR reflects visual-motor inhibition. The “attentional momentum” account rejects this idea, and instead proposes that IOR reflects an automatic shift of attention away from the cued location resulting in slower RTs to targets presented there and speeded RTs to targets opposite the cue (an opposite facilitation effect or OFE). The drawback of this account is that J. J. Snyder, W. C. Schmidt, and A. Kingstone (2001) showed that there are few data to support the OFE, and no evidence that the OFE accounts for the IOR effect. Despite this evidence, several recent studies have promoted attentional momentum as a valid explanation for the IOR effect. Reanalysis of these recent studies and new data reveal, again, that IOR routinely occurs in the absence of the OFE, and when the OFE does occur, the IOR effect need not be present. This double dissociation invalidates attentional momentum as an explanation for the IOR effect. Extant data support an inhibitory explanation of the IOR effect.

In Study 2, the authors examined sex differences in octant scores of the IIP circumplex (scale level), in a reanalysis of archival data. The structural summary method was used to identify points of maximum difference between men and women in the interpersonal continuum and to estimate effect sizes. Results from the 2 studies converged in suggesting a dimension of difference involving problems in Hostile-Dominance vs. Friendly-Submission. The magnitude of effect size was consistent with previous reports in the personality literature. These sex differences appeared to be best explained by a one-dimensional model. Findings were generally consistent across 3 different types of samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We introduce a novel computer implementation of the Unification-Space parser (Vosse and Kempen in Cognition 75:105–143, 2000) in the form of a localist neural network whose dynamics is based on interactive activation and inhibition. The wiring of the network is determined by Performance Grammar (Kempen and Harbusch in Verb constructions in German and Dutch. Benjamins, Amsterdam, 2003), a lexicalist formalism with feature unification as binding operation. While the network is processing input word strings incrementally, the evolving shape of parse trees is represented in the form of changing patterns of activation in nodes that code for syntactic properties of words and phrases, and for the grammatical functions they fulfill. The system is capable, at least qualitatively and rudimentarily, of simulating several important dynamic aspects of human syntactic parsing, including garden-path phenomena and reanalysis, effects of complexity (various types of clause embeddings), fault-tolerance in case of unification failures and unknown words, and predictive parsing (expectation-based analysis, surprisal effects).

Abstract = {Chagnon’s analysis of a well-known axe fight in the Yanomamö village of Mishimishiböwei-teri (Chagnon and Bugos 1979) is among the earliest empirical tests of kin selection theory for explaining cooperation in humans. Kin selection theory describes how cooperation can be organized around genetic kinship and is a fundamental tool for understanding cooperation within family groups. Previous analysis on groups of cooperative Lamaleran whale hunters suggests that the role of genetic kinship as a principle for organizing cooperative human groups could be less important in certain cases than previously thought (Alvard Human Nature 14:129–163, 2003b). Evidence that supports a strong role for genetic kinship—groups are found to be more related than expected by chance—may be spurious because of the correlation between social structure and genetic kinship. Reanalysis of Chagnon’s data using matrix regression techniques, however, confirms that genetic kinship was the primary organizing principle in the axe fight; affinal relations were also important, whereas lineage identity explained nothing.

He concluded that the ACT studies had more methodological deficiencies, and thus the treatment did not qualify as an “empirically supported treatment.” Although Öst noted several important limitations that should be carefully considered when evaluating early ACT research, his attempt to devise an empirical matching strategy by creating a comparison sample of CBT studies to bolster his conclusions was itself problematic. The samples were clearly mismatched in terms of the populations being treated, leading to differences in study design and methodology. Furthermore, reanalysis showed clear differences in grant support favoring CBT compared with ACT studies that were not reported in the original article. Given the actual mismatch between the samples, Öst's methodological ratings are difficult to interpret and provide little useful information beyond what could already be gathered by a qualitative review of ACT study limitations. Such limitations are characteristic of the earlier randomized controlled trials of any emerging psychotherapeutic approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been at the center stage of migraine pathophysiology for approximately six decades. Reanalysis of CSD reveals several major unbridgeable gaps in this experimental neurophysiology concept for migraine. Key phenotypic and pharmacological features of migraine challenge the assumed pathophysiologic role of CSD. Detection of subclinical infarct-like white matter lesions (WMLs) in the brain of some migraine patients stimulated the concept of CSD-related BBB disruption. Raised plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in migraine patients in the headache phase, specifically MMP-9, suggested a pathogenetic role for MMP elevation in the development of both migraine attacks and WMLs. Migraine attacks with or without aura present a unique, profound and protracted vasodilatory challenge to the homeostatic systems of the brain To accommodate the rather sudden increase in cerebral blood flow, the brain circulatory network must dilate and the BBB must expand considerably. MMPs can influence expansion of the extracellular matrix of the BBB and loosening of the intercellular tight junctions between endothelial cells through proteolytic degradation during migrainous cerebrovascular dilatation. WMLs most probably reflect transient and discrete breakdown of the BBB consequent to sustained cerebral hyperperfusion rather than hypoperfusion. Systemic elevations of MMPs are not specific to migraine but are found in a variety of neurological and extra-neurological disorders. This perspective presents a conceptual dissociation between the effects of CSD on the brain of experimental animals and the clinical phenomena in migraine patients.

Abstract = {Recently, a number of model selection heuristics (i.e. DIFFIT, CORCONDIA, the numerical convex hull based heuristic) have been proposed for choosing among Parafac and/or Tucker3 solutions of different complexity for a given three-way three-mode data set. Such heuristics are often validated by means of extensive simulation studies. However, these simulation studies are unrealistic in that it is assumed that the variance in real three-way data can be split into two parts: structural variance, due to a true underlying Parafac or Tucker3 model of low complexity, and random noise. In this paper, we start from the much more reasonable assumption that the variance in any real three-way data set is due to three different sources: (1) a strong Parafac or Tucker3 structure of low complexity, accounting for a considerable amount of variance, (2) a weak Tucker3 structure, capturing less prominent data aspects, and (3) random noise. As such, Parafac and Tucker3 simulation studies are run in which the data are generated by adding a weak Tucker3 structure to a strong Parafac or Tucker3 one and perturbing the resulting data with random noise. The design of these studies is based on the reanalysis of real data sets. In these studies, the performance of the numerical convex hull based model selection method is evaluated with respect to its capability of discriminating strong from weak underlying structures. The results show that in about two-thirds of the simulated cases, the hull heuristic yields a model of the same complexity as the strong underlying structure and thus succeeds in disentangling strong and weak underlying structures. In the vast majority of the remaining third, this heuristic selects a solution that combines the strong structure and (part of) the weak structure.

Abstract = {Despite the sensitivity of neuropsychological tests to educational level, improved diagnostic accuracy for demographically corrected scores has yet to be established. Diagnostic efficiency statistics of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Ill (WAIS-III) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Ill (WMS-III) indices that were corrected for education, sex, and age (demographically corrected) were compared with age corrected indices in individuals aged 16 to 75 years with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 12 years or less education. TBI participants (n = 100) were consecutive referrals to an outpatient rehabilitation service and met careful selection criteria. Controls (n = 100) were obtained from the WAIS-III/WMS-III standardization sample. Demographically corrected indices did not provide higher diagnostic efficiency than age corrected indices and this result was supported by reanalysis of the TBI group against a larger and unmatched control group. Processing Speed Index provided comparable diagnostic accuracy to that of combined indices. Demographically corrected indices were associated with higher cut-scores to maximize overall classification, reflecting the upward adjustment of those scores in a lower education sample. This suggests that, in clinical practice, the test results of individuals with limited education may be more accurately interpreted with the application of demographic corrections. Diagnostic efficiency statistics are presented, and future research directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The intensity and valence of 30 emotion terms, 30 events typical of those emotions, and 30 autobiographical memories cued by those emotions were each rated by different groups of 40 undergraduates. A vector model gave a consistently better account of the data than a circumplex model, both overall and in the absence of high-intensity, neutral valence stimuli. The Positive Activation—Negative Activation (PANA) model could be tested at high levels of activation, where it is identical to the vector model. The results replicated when ratings of arousal were used instead of ratings of intensity for the events and autobiographical memories. A reanalysis of word norms gave further support for the vector and PANA models by demonstrating that neutral valence, high-arousal ratings resulted from the averaging of individual positive and negative valence ratings. Thus, compared to a circumplex model, vector and PANA models provided overall better fits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The authors describe research aimed at developing a more comprehensive framework for project-based learning in work contexts. This grows out of a cross-cultural reanalysis of data from two previous studies using two different frameworks: actor-centered learning network theory and a critical pragmatist lens on action reflection learning. Findings are based on a cross analysis of a subset of one another’s data sets using the authors’ respective original frameworks, thus intending to build reflexivity into the latter. The study identifies strengths and weaknesses of each framework and discusses a more comprehensive framework that takes into account both individual and organizational learning at a time when learning in work contexts is increasingly driven by the learner and integrated with work.

Abstract = {[Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 17(1) of Developmental Science (see record [rid]2013-44443-015[/rid]). The original article, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editors in Chief, Michelle De Haan and Charles Nelson and John Wiley & Sons Limited. The authors determined that the looking time coding performed by the first author, N. Mahajan, was inaccurate and did not reflect the looking times found by other trained coders. A reanalysis of the data reported in this paper failed to verify the reported effects, and thus the authors have requested that the publication be retracted.] Both human infants and adult non-human primates share the capacity to track small numbers of objects across time and occlusion. The question now facing developmental and comparative psychologists is whether similar mechanisms give rise to this capacity across the two populations. Here, we explore whether non-human primates' object tracking abilities are subject to the same constraints as those of human infants. In particular, we examine whether one primate species, the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), also fails to represent and enumerate objects when they behave non-rigidly or non-cohesively. We presented lemurs with a series of expectancy violation studies involving simple 1 + 1 addition events in which we varied the entities to be enumerated. Like infants, lemurs successfully enumerated the two objects when those objects were rigid, cohesive individuals, but failed to enumerate similar-looking non-rigid piles of sand. In contrast to human infants, however, lemurs successfully enumerated non-cohesive objects that broke into multiple pieces. These results are discussed in light of recent theories about object processing in human infants and adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The Social Relations Model (SRM) allows for examination of family relations on three different levels: the individual level (actor and partner effects), the dyadic level (relationship effects), and the family level (family effect). The aim of this study was to present a systematic review of SRM family studies and identify general patterns in the results. Results of reanalyses of 17 data sets showed that characteristics of the person who reports on the relationship and the unique characteristics of the relationship were most important explanations of differences in family relationships. The present systematic review contributes to a better understanding of who is driving relationship outcomes in families and provides suggestions concerning the application of the SRM to family data.

Abstract = {Objective: The exposure-response relationship for manganese (Mn)-induced adverse nervous system effects is not well described. Symptoms and neuropsychological deficits associated with early manganism were previously reported for welders constructing bridge piers during 2003 to 2004. A reanalysis using improved exposure, work history information, and diverse exposure metrics is presented here. Methods: Ten neuropsychological performance measures were examined, including working memory index (WMI), verbal intelligence quotient, design fluency, Stroop color word test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, and Auditory Consonant Trigram tests. Mn blood levels and air sampling data in the form of both personal and area samples were available. The exposure metrics used were cumulative exposure to Mn, body burden assuming simple first-order kinetics for Mn elimination, and cumulative burden (effective dose). Benchmark doses were calculated. Results: Burden with a half-life of about 150 days was the best predictor of blood Mn. WMI performance declined by 3.6 (normal = 100, SD = 15) for each 1.0 mg/m³ × mo exposure (P = 0.02, one tailed). At the group mean exposure metric (burden; half-life = 275 days), WMI performance was at the lowest 17th percentile of normal, and at the maximum observed metric, performance was at the lowest 2.5 percentiles. Four other outcomes also exhibited statistically significant associations (verbal intelligence quotient, verbal comprehension index, design fluency, Stroop color word test); no dose-rate effect was observed for three of the five outcomes. Conclusions: A risk assessment performed for the five stronger effects, choosing various percentiles of normal performance to represent impairment, identified benchmark doses for a 2-year exposure leading to 5% excess impairment prevalence in the range of 0.03 to 0.15 mg/m³, or 30 to 150 μg/m³, total Mn in air, levels that are far below those permitted by current occupational standards. More than one-third of workers would be impaired after working 2 years at 0.2 mg/m³ Mn (the current threshold limit value). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The authors assume that individuals adapt rationally to a utility function given constraints imposed by their cognitive architecture and the local task environment. This assumption underlies a new approach to modeling and understanding cognition—cognitively bounded rational analysis—that sharpens the predictive acuity of general, integrated theories of cognition and action. Such theories provide the necessary computational means to explain the flexible nature of human behavior but in doing so introduce extreme degrees of freedom in accounting for data. The new approach narrows the space of predicted behaviors through analysis of the payoff achieved by alternative strategies, rather than through fitting strategies and theoretical parameters to data. It extends and complements established approaches, including computational cognitive architectures, rational analysis, optimal motor control, bounded rationality, and signal detection theory. The authors illustrate the approach with a reanalysis of an existing account of psychological refractory period (PRP) dual-task performance and the development and analysis of a new theory of ordered dual-task responses. These analyses yield several novel results, including a new understanding of the role of strategic variation in existing accounts of PRP and the first predictive, quantitative account showing how the details of ordered dual-task phenomena emerge from the rational control of a cognitive system subject to the combined constraints of internal variance, motor interference, and a response selection bottleneck.

Abstract = {Objectives: Participants who obtain an HIV test outside of an HIV vaccine efficacy trial could potentially unblind themselves which could result in differential behavior change and loss to follow-up based on assignment status. In a reanalysis of the VaxGen VAX004 data, the objectives were to determine: 1) the proportion of participants who were tested for HIV outside of the study (despite instructions not to do this) and reasons why; 2) demographic and risk factors associated with reported testing outside of the study; and 3) if outside testing was related to participant loss to follow-up. Methods: Analyses were restricted to men who have sex with men (MSM) who completed a survey at one or more annual visits in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of a bivalent rgp 120 vaccine conducted from 1998-2002. A generalized linear mixture model assessed associations with outside testing. Results: Despite instructions to the contrary, 16.9% (791/4670) of MSM reported being tested for HIV outside of the study, with the top two reasons being a) medical provider request (28.1%) and b) insurance requirement (17.1%). Increased odds of self-reported outside testing was associated with site location, reporting one or more sexually transmitted infections (STIs), joining the trial because of the belief that participation might confer some protection against HIV infection, engaging in unprotected anal sex, and being lost to follow-up. Decreased odds of self-reported outside testing was associated with perceived study arm assignment to vaccine or uncertainty about study arm assignment compared to placebo. Conclusions: To avoid biases such as differential risk behavior and loss to follow-up based on perceived assignment status, initiating additional procedures to reduce the likelihood of outside testing will be important to assure the validity of future study results.

Abstract = {In a previous study, we established that compared to a written case, a video case enhances observable cognitive processes in the verbal interaction in a postgraduate problem-based learning format. In a new study we examined non-observable cognitive processes using a stimulated recall procedure alongside a reanalysis of the data from the first study. We examined the development of shared cognition as reflected in collaborative concept link formation, an approach to connecting a series of concepts related to a particular topic. Eleven paediatric residents were randomly allocated to two groups. After both analysing the same written case vignette, one group watched a video of the case in the vignette and the other group read a written description of the video. Both groups then reanalysed the vignette. After the group sessions, time-logged transcripts were made of the verbal interaction in both groups and all residents individually took part in a stimulated recall procedure. Causal reasoning concept links were labelled as individual or collaborative depending on whether they originated from individual residents or were directly elicited by verbal utterances from others. The video led to a significantly increased frequency ratio (after intervention: before intervention) of collaborative concept links but did not affect the frequency of individual concept links. This novel process approach to chronological registration of concept link formation offered additional evidence that shared cognition by means of co-elaboration of concept formation is stimulated by the use of patient video recordings in small group learning.

Abstract = {Disfluencies can affect language comprehension, but to date, most studies have focused on disfluent pauses such as er. We investigated whether disfluent repetitions in speech have discernible effects on listeners during language comprehension, and whether repetitions affect the linguistic processing of subsequent words in speech in ways which have been previously observed with ers. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to measure participants’ neural responses to disfluent repetitions of words relative to acoustically identical words in fluent contexts, as well as to unpredictable and predictable words that occurred immediately post-disfluency and in fluent utterances. We additionally measured participants’ recognition memories for the predictable and unpredictable words. Repetitions elicited an early onsetting relative positivity (100–400ms post-stimulus), clearly demonstrating listeners’ sensitivity to the presence of disfluent repetitions. Unpredictable words elicited an N400 effect. Importantly, there was no evidence that this effect, thought to reflect the difficulty of semantically integrating unpredictable compared to predictable words, differed quantitatively between fluent and disfluent utterances. Furthermore there was no evidence that the memorability of words was affected by the presence of a preceding repetition. These findings contrast with previous research which demonstrated an N400 attenuation of, and an increase in memorability for, words that were preceded by an er. However, in a later (600–900ms) time window, unpredictable words following a repetition elicited a relative positivity. Reanalysis of previous data confirmed the presence of a similar effect following an er. The effect may reflect difficulties in resuming linguistic processing following any disruption to speech.

Abstract = {In this study, the authors examined the factor structure and temporal stability of the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS; G. L. Flett, P. L. Hewitt, D. J. Boucher, L. A. Davidson, & Y. Munro, 1997) in 2 samples of adolescents (15–16 years old). In Sample 1 (n = 624), confirmatory factor analysis did not support a 2-factor structure (self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism). As in B. T. McCreary, T. E. Joiner, N. B. Schmidt, & N. S. Ialongo (2004), reanalysis suggested a 3-factor solution (i.e., socially prescribed perfectionism, self-oriented–Striving perfectionism, self-oriented–Critical perfectionism). The authors validated their 3-factor model in an independent replication sample (Sample 2; n = 514) and confirmed that the 3-factor structure was invariant across gender and time (test–retest over 6 months). Taking these analyses together, the authors concluded that their discriminant 3-factor structure is robust. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. More research on the predictive validity of the CAPS is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study reanalyses the commuter train incident that involved the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). The incident, which occurred on 25 April 2005, claimed 107 lives (passengers and the train driver) and injured 562 passengers. The delay in using the brake and the train driver’s inattention generated confusion and serious errors. The train driver’s inattentiveness may be attributed to his grave concern over reporting personal mistakes to company authorities as it is mandatory for erring JR West crew members to go through ‘learning practices’. The phenomenological analyses showed how the unintended consequences of such learning practices played a key role in the train incident. This study also draws on Foucault’s concepts on discipline to analyse the learning practices in JR West, and employs the concept of collective myopia to account for the reasoning of JR West managers.

Abstract = {Context: Imaging and post-mortem studies provide converging evidence that patients with schizophrenia have a dysregulated developmental trajectory of frontal lobe myelination. The hypothesis that typical and atypical medications may differentially impact brain myelination in adults with schizophrenia was previously assessed with inversion recovery (IR) images. Increased white matter (WM) volume suggestive of increased myelination was detected in the patient group treated with an atypical antipsychotic compared to a typical one. Objective: In a follow-up reanalysis of MRI images from the original study, we used a novel method to assess whether the difference in WM volumes could be caused by a differential effect of medications on the intracortical myelination process. Design, setting, and participants: Two different male cohorts of healthy controls ranging in age from 18–35 years were compared to cohorts of subjects with schizophrenia who were treated with either oral risperidone (Ris) or fluphenazine decanoate (Fd). Main outcome measure: A novel MRI method that combines the distinct tissue contrasts provided by IR and proton density (PD) images was used to estimate intracortical myelin (ICM) volume. Results: When compared with their pooled healthy control comparison group, the two groups of schizophrenic patients differed in the frontal lobe ICM measure with the Ris group having significantly higher volume. Conclusions: The data suggest that in adults with schizophrenia antipsychotic treatment choice may be specifically and differentially impacting later-myelinating intracortical circuitry. In vivo MRI can be used to dissect subtle differences in brain tissue characteristics and thus help clarify the effect of pharmacologic treatments on developmental and pathologic processes.

Abstract = {Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) has been associated with risk of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, autism and Asperger syndrome, but apart from in the original translocation family, true causal variants have yet to be confirmed. Here we report a harmonized association study for DISC1 in European cohorts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We identify regions of significant association, demonstrate allele frequency heterogeneity and provide preliminary evidence for modifying interplay between variants. Whereas no associations survived permutation analysis in the combined data set, significant corrected associations were observed for bipolar disorder at rs1538979 in the Finnish cohorts (uncorrected P = 0.00020; corrected P = 0.016; odds ratio = 2.73 ± 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42–5.27) and at rs821577 in the London cohort (uncorrected P = 0.00070; corrected P = 0.040; odds ratio = 1.64 ± 95% CI 1.23–2.19). The rs821577 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed evidence for increased risk within the combined European cohorts (odds ratio = 1.27 ± 95% CI 1.07–1.51), even though significant corrected association was not detected (uncorrected P = 0.0058; corrected P = 0.28). After conditioning the European data set on the two risk alleles, reanalysis revealed a third significant SNP association (uncorrected P = 0.00050; corrected P = 0.025). This SNP showed evidence for interplay, either increasing or decreasing risk, dependent upon the presence or absence of rs1538979 or rs821577. These findings provide further support for the role of DISC1 in psychiatric illness and demonstrate the presence of locus heterogeneity, with the effect that clinically relevant genetic variants may go undetected by standard analysis of combined cohorts.

Abstract = {Improving end-of-life care is a priority in the United States, but assigning priorities for standard care services requires evaluations using appropriate study design and appropriate outcome indicators. A recent randomized controlled trial with terminally ill patients produced no evidence of benefit from massage or guided meditation, when evaluated with measures of global quality of life or pain distress over the course of patient participation. However, reanalysis using a more targeted outcome, surrogates’ assessment of patients’ benefit from the study intervention, suggested significant gains from massage—the treatment patients gave their highest preassignment preference ratings. The authors conclude that adding a menu of complementary therapies as part of standard end-of-life care may yield significant benefit, that patient preference is an important predictor of outcome, and that modifications in trial design may be appropriate for end-of-life studies.

Abstract = {We investigated the structure of the Greek personality lexicon, based on a reanalysis of the data reported by Saucier, Georgiades, Tsaousis, and Goldberg. To facilitate comparisons with previous lexical studies of personality structure, our factor analyses were based on ipsatized (i.e., within-subject standardized) ratings on the Greek adjective variable set, after the removal of “negative valence” (or low base rate) adjectives. Results showed a six-factor solution that was very similar to those obtained in a diverse array of other languages, and thus suggest that this six-dimensional structure of personality variation does generalize to the Greek culture.

Abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are associated with significant sexual side effects. By definition, all SSRIs increase overall serotonin (5HT) by binding to serotonin autoreceptors (5HTIA); however, each SSRI has a unique portfolio of secondary binding properties to other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE). As 5HTIA receptors mediate NE neurotransmission, SSRIs that are highly selective for 5HTIA are more likely to reduce NE efficiency; however, in SSRIs that are less selective for 5HTIA, this could be counteracted by secondary binding to NE. Norepinephrine is the major neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which has been shown to mediate genital arousal in women; thus, it is possible that increasing SNS activity in women taking SSRIs that are highly selective for 5HTIA may counteract sexual side effects in those women. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reanalysis of Meston (2004)'s 8-week, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study of the effects of ephedrine (50 mg taken 1 h prior to sexual activity) on self-reported sexual functioning of women taking paroxetine (N = 5), sertraline (N = 7), or fluoxetine (N = 7). As predicted, women taking SSRIs, which are highly selective for 5HTIA (sertraline, paroxetine), showed improvement in sexual arousal and orgasm. By contrast, women taking SSRIs, which are less selective for 5HTIA relative to NE (fluoxetine), showed no change or decrease in sexual functioning. These findings have implications for treating certain SSRI-induced sexual side effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Familial late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) shows high heritability. However, with the exception of ApoE, no well-replicated susceptibility genes have been identified to date. Several genome-wide linkage studies have nominated potential susceptibility loci but results are inconsistent, with individual scans showing few significant LOD scores. We have pooled linkage results from five independent genome scans and used the genome search meta-analysis (GSMA) method to analyse these data. The combined sample results in 2206 affected individuals and 785 families from Caucasian and Caribbean Hispanic ethnicities. The Caucasian samples included subjects from the US, the Netherlands and Sweden. Genome-wide suggestive evidence for linkage was observed on chromosomes 1p13.3-q31.1, 7pter-p21.1 and 8p22-p21.1 in the weighted GSMA analysis. The chromosome 8p region achieved the lowest summed rank p-value of 0.001.We also identified seven loci with nominally significant evidence for linkage to 3q12.3-q22.1, 6p21.1-q15, 7p14.1-q21.11, 17q24.3-qter and 19p13.3-qter. The GSMA finding suggests that these loci may harbour susceptibility genes for LOAD. We have also developed a web resource (http://alzres.iop.kcl.ac.uk/) to present additional GSMA analyses with different study selection criteria, facilitate the reanalysis of genome-wide linkage data and provide open access to the GSMA data.

Abstract = {Much has been learned over the past 25 years about how attention influences neuronal responses to stimuli in the visual cortex of monkeys and humans. The most recent studies have used parametric manipulations of stimulus attributes such as orientation, direction of motion, and contrast to elucidate the form of the attentional mechanism. The results of these studies do not always agree. However, some of this inconsistency may be caused which attentional effects are considered, such as contrast gain, response gain, or a baseline shift in firing rate with attention. Here, seven studies of spatial and feature-based attention, ranging from monkey electrophysiological studies in V4 and MT to fMRI studies in human visual cortex, are reevaluated in the context of a single parametric model that incorporates a variety of ways in which attention can influence neuronal responses. This reanalysis shows that most, though not all, of these results can be explained by a similar combination of attentional mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Attribute framing refers to an effect of descriptive valence on evaluations or decision making. According to "reference point hypothesis" proposed by McKenzie and his associates (e.g., Sher & McKenzie, 2006), a speaker chooses a frame based on his/her reference point, and listeners can infer the reference point from the mentioned frame. In the present study, we pointed out that people tend to prefer one frame in logically equivalent two frames when describing a situation, and explored the effect of difference in frame use on inference about speaker's reference point. Reanalysis of previous studies (McKenzie & Nelson, 2003) and experimental studies indicated that the difference in frame use influenced listeners' inference about speaker's reference point. The reference point hypothesis has difficulty predicting these results. We discuss cognitive processes of frame-based inference about speaker's reference point and implications for framing effects.

Abstract = {Comments on the article by Franz and Gegenfurtner entitled, “Grasping visual illusions: Consistent data and no dissociation” (see record [rid]2009-11613-003[/rid]). In their article, Franz and Gegenfurtner argue that the evidence for a division of labor within the visual system for action and perception is flawed because perception is often measured by manual estimation, which responds in general with a larger slope to a change of physical size than does adjusting. Therefore results obtained under manual estimation have to be corrected for this difference in slope: In a reanalysis of six studies grasping and perception were equally influenced by the illusion after this correction. However, closer inspection of methods reveals that visual feedback was confounded with conditions (suppressed vision while grasping vs. full vision while adjusting). We argue that studies can produce relevant and decisive data only when they (a) do not confound conditions with visual feedback, (b) do not allow online corrections of the action due to a direct comparison of the hand with the target, and (c) do not provide any risk of grasping being memory driven when the target is removed.

Abstract = {The process of collaborative inquiry learning requires maintaining a mutual understanding of the task, along with reaching consensus on strategies, plans and domain knowledge. In this study, we explore how different supportive measures affect students’ consensus-building process, based on a re-analysis of data from four studies. We distinguish between scaffolds that aim at supporting students’ collaborative processes and scaffolds that aim primarily at supporting the inquiry learning process. The overall picture that emerges from the reanalysis is that integration-oriented consensus-building activities are facilitated by scaffolds that provide explicit instruction in rules for effective collaboration and by scaffolds that encourage students to collaboratively construct a representation. Scaffolds that display interindividual differences between students’ opinions resulted primarily in quick consensus-building activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Many robust analogs of the classic analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method have been proposed, some of which are based on some type of regression smoother. A method that first appeared in this journal, which is relatively simple and performs well in simulations, is based on a running interval smoother combined with comparing medians or 20% trimmed means. It makes no parametric assumption about the regression lines and does not assume that the regression lines are parallel. A possible way of improving the efficiency of the running interval smoother is to use bootstrap bagging and a minor goal here is to report some results supporting this approach. The major goal is to consider how ANCOVA might be performed when bootstrap bagging is used. Simple extensions of extant approaches that use some type of bootstrap method were found to be unsatisfactory. However, a basic percentile bootstrap method was found to perform well in simulations. And a reanalysis of data dealing with teachers’ expectations about the cognitive ability of students illustrates that bootstrap bagging can make a practical difference.

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., >.8) correlations between brain activation and personality measures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds—not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.

Abstract = {Background: Double-blind placebo-controlled trials are intended to control for the impact of expectancy on outcomes. Whether they always achieve this is, however, questionable. Methods: Reanalysis of a clinical trial of naltrexone and acamprosate for alcohol dependence investigated this issue further. In this trial, 169 alcohol-dependent patients received naltrexone, acamprosate or placebo for 12 weeks. In addition to being assessed on various indices of alcohol dependence, they were asked whether they believed they received active medication or placebo. Results: While there were no differences in outcomes between treatment groups, those who believed they had been taking active medication consumed fewer alcoholic drinks and reported less alcohol dependence and cravings. That is, irrespective of actual treatment, perceived medication allocation predicted health outcomes. Conclusions: These results highlight the differences between treatment administration in clinical trials and standard medical practice, a discrepancy that may sometimes decrease the validity of these types of trials.

The authors reconstructed 59 data sets from published studies in which response bias had been manipulated experimentally. These data were fit with signal detection theory (SDT) and a twohigh- threshold model (2HTM). However, the G2 statistic for SDT fits was misspecified, and there were some errors in the reconstructed frequencies. (The authors are greatly indebted to David Kellen, who noticed these issues and cross-checked the corrections.) Below are corrected results; the authors also (a) separately analyzed read and anagram word data from Buchner et al.’s (1995) Experiments 1 and 2, and (b) included reconstructed binary response results from Curran et al. (2007), Experiment 3. All data sets were reanalyzed by minimizing G2 for SDT and 2HTM using various routines with converging results. Rather than presenting a corrected version of the complete 4-page appendix table in Bro¨der and Schu¨tz, the new G2 values are reported following the same order as the originally tabled studies from top to bottom, but with four instead of two data sets from Buchner et al. and four instead of three from Curran et al. Square brackets indicate which values stem from the same literature source to further facilitate their correct assignment.] Recent reviews of recognition receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) claim that their curvilinear shape rules out threshold models of recognition. However, the shape of ROCs based on confidence ratings is not diagnostic to refute threshold models, whereas ROCs based on experimental bias manipulations are. Also, fitting predicted frequencies to actual data is a more sensitive method for model comparisons than ROC regressions. In a reanalysis of 59 published data sets, the 2-high-threshold model (2HTM) fit the data better than an unequal variance signal detection model in about half of the cases. Three recognition experiments with experimental bias manipulation were conducted that yielded linear ROCs and a better fit of the 2HTM in all cases. On the basis of actual data and a simulation, the authors argue that both models are at least equally valid as measurement tools and can perhaps be integrated theoretically.

Abstract = {Objective: To establish a reliable and valid scale structure of a patient-reported outcome measuring thyroid-specific quality of life. Methods: The 98-item ThyPRO questionnaire was administered to patients with benign thyroid diseases at two university hospitals. Multi-trait scaling was performed, evaluating lack of convergent validity (item-own scale polyserial correlation <0.40) or lack of discriminant validity (item-other scale correlation higher than item-own scale correlation) of the hypothesized scale structure. Analyses were repeated in clinical and sociodemographic subgroups and with Pearson correlations. Reliability was estimated by Cronbach’s α, both conventionally and with polychoric correlations. Results: In total, 904 patients (69%) responded. Initial multitrait scaling analysis identified 25 scaling errors. Twelve items were omitted from the scale structure, and a reanalysis showed complete convergent validity and only two instances of lack of discriminant validity. Pearson correlations yielded similar results. Across all subgroups, convergent validity was complete, and discriminant validity was found in 99.2% of tests. Lack of discriminant validity was mainly between physical symptoms and psychological and disease-impact scales. Cronbach’s α was acceptable (>0.70, >0.80 with polychoric correlations) for all 13 scales. Conclusion: A reliable scale structure displaying complete convergent and almost complete discriminant validity was established in general analyses and in distinct clinical subgroups of patients with benign thyroid diseases.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between the presence and magnitude of fever and susceptibility to febrile seizures, defined as a known family history of febrile seizures. Methods: Reanalysis of a case-control study dataset (Am J Dis Child. 1993;147:35-39). The magnitude of presenting fever was examined between the incident febrile seizure group (N=75) and febrile control group (N=150) for a family history of febrile seizures. The presence of fever was examined between the febrile control group (N=150) and the afebrile control group (N=150) for a family history of febrile seizures. Results: Children with incident febrile seizures had a higher temperature in the emergency department than febrile controls (39.3°C vs 39.0°C, p=.004). Febrile control children with a known family history of febrile seizures had higher temperatures than those without a known family history (39.5°C vs 38.9°C, p=.04). A model of fever magnitude within the febrile group (seizures and controls) suggested that most of this relationship was on the basis of family history of febrile seizures rather than seizure or control status, with a possibility of interaction. Within the control children (febrile and afebrile), a known family history of febrile seizures was associated with fever (OR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1,10.7). Conclusions: Children susceptible to febrile seizures through a known family history of febrile seizures appear more likely to present to emergency departments with fever, and when compared to their febrile counterparts, a fever of higher magnitude. This data supports Rantala's assertion "It may be that regulation of temperature is different in children susceptible to febrile seizures".

Abstract = {In patients with schizophrenia who do not have an optimal response to clozapine, it remains unclear if there is an evidence base to support a second antipsychotic in combination with clozapine. The present systematic review was therefore carried out to determine the efficacy of various clozapine combination strategies with antipsychotics. Relevant studies were located by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, Medline, and Embase (up to November 2007). Only studies randomly allocating patients to clozapine plus another antipsychotic vs clozapine monotherapy were included. The search yielded 21 studies suitable for reanalysis. In 3 trials, clozapine was combined with a phenothiazine, in 8 trials with a benzamide, and in the remaining trials with risperidone. While the majority of randomized trials were not double blind, 6 studies were double-blind placebo-controlled trials. A total of 14 randomized open studies significantly favored clozapine combination strategy in terms of mean difference (random effect standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.14 to -0.46); however, data extracted from 6 randomized double-blind studies did not show a statistically significant positive effect of this combination strategy in terms of mean difference (SMD =0.12, 95% CI = -0.57 to 0.32). In terms of percentage of patients failing to show an improvement, a total of 10 randomized open studies significantly favored clozapine combination strategy (random effect relative risk [RR] = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.97), but data extracted from 6 randomized double-blind studies did not show a statistically significant positive effect of this combination strategy (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.11). We conclude that the evidence base supporting a second antipsychotic in addition to clozapine in partially responsive patients with schizophrenia is weak. This weak evidence indicates modest to absent benefit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In artificial-grammar learning, it is crucial to ensure that above-chance performance in the test stage is due to learning in the training stage but not due to judgemental biases. Here we argue that multiple regression analysis can be successfully combined with the use of control groups to assess whether participants were able to transfer knowledge acquired during training when making judgements about test stimuli. We compared the regression weights of judgements in a transfer condition (training and test strings were constructed by the same grammar but with different letters) with those in a control condition. Predictors were identical in both conditions—judgements of control participants were treated as if they were based on knowledge gained in a standard training stage. The results of this experiment as well as reanalyses of a former study support the usefulness of our approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Psychometric measures of processing speed are strong predictors of cognitive functioning with aging; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Recently, the authors reported a negative association between calculated free testosterone levels (cEFT) and processing speed in men aged between 50 and 70 years (Martin, Wittert, Burns, & McPherson, 2008). Ex-Gaussian decomposition of reaction time (RT) distributions allows for the robust estimation of skew in the distribution, which may reflect poorer attentional control. In a reanalysis of data from this previous study, the authors examined the associations between age, cEFT levels, and ex-Gaussian parameters derived from four RT tasks as predictors of cognitive functioning performance in 96 middle-to-older aged men. Results indicated that cEFT levels were significantly associated with increased skew in the RT distribution (i.e., the exponential portion) but not with the estimates derived from the Gaussian portion of the curve. Further, path analysis across the entire data set showed that this association was a strong predictor of processing speed performance. Taken together these results suggest that cEFT levels moderate cognitive functioning performance in males via attentional control processes.

Abstract = {In recent years considerable efforts have been spent on the development of the occlusion technique as a procedure for the assessment of the human–machine interface of in-vehicle information and communication systems (IVIS) designed to be used by the driver while driving. The importance and significance of the findings resulting from the application of this procedure depends essentially on its reliability. Because there is a lack of evidence as to whether this basic criterion of measurement is met with this procedure, and because questionable reliability can lead to doubts about their validity, our project strove to clarify this issue. This paper reports on a statistical reanalysis of data obtained from previous experiments. To summarise, the characteristic values found for internal consistency were almost all in the range of .90 for the occlusion technique, which can be considered satisfactory.

The results are consistently better neuropsychological test scores by those with higher IQ scores, with the exception of the Finger Tapping Test (dominant hand).

Abstract = {P. Saunders's (1996, 1997) recent work claiming that contemporary British society is to a large extent "meritocratic" is criticized on conceptual and technical grounds. A reanalysis of the National Child Development Study data-set, used by Saunders, is presented. This reveals that while merit, defined in terms of ability and effort, does play a part in determining individuals' class destinations, the effect of class origins remains strong. Children of less advantaged class origins need to show substantially more merit than children from more advantaged origins in order to gain similar class positions. These differences in findings to some extent arise from the correction of biases introduced by Saunders; however, there are also features of his own results, consistent with those reported in the reanalysis, which he appears not to have fully appreciated.

Abstract = {The usefulness of the actigraph methodology has been demonstrated in normal individuals. However, the validity of actigraphy has been questioned in insomnia patients because of the considerable measurement error that has been reported between actigraphy (ACT) and polysomnography (PSG). Independent investigations by P. J. Hauri and J. Wisbey (1992) and by I. Verbeek et al (1994) have reported errors of 48 and 49 min in total sleep time between ACT and PSG. In the present study, with a sample of 26 insomniac adults (mean age 46.46 yrs), a reanalysis of the Hauri and Wisbey study was conducted with a scoring method called the Actigraph Data Analysis Software (ADAS; G. Jean-Louis, 1987). Based on this reanalysis, a measurement error of only 25 min between the 2 methods was obtained. This finding may be an indication of the advantage of the ADAS scoring method. A strong correlation coefficient was noted between ACT and PSG for total sleep time, thus suggesting a high degree of accuracy of the actigraph methodology in assessing the sleep/wake profile of insomniacs.

Abstract = {Many theories of parsing predict that the difficulty of syntactic reanalysis depends on the type of structural change involved. However, most existing experimental data show that reanalysis difficulty is affected by nonstructural factors like plausibility and verb bias, whereas claims about structural change are typically based on intuition alone. We report two self-paced reading experiments (24 university students and 28 participants, respectively) which demonstrate clear differences in the magnitude of garden path effects associated with different types of structural change. However, difficulty of reanalysis was not affected by the position of the head noun within the ambiguous phrase. We interpret these results in terms of theories of structural change such as Sturt and Crocker (1996). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

This reanalysis forces a reinterpretation of historical trends in the field.

Abstract = {In an event-related potential (ERP) study using 120 college students, German sentences were investigated that contained a case-ambiguous noun phrase (NP) that could be assigned accusative or dative case. Sentences were disambiguated by the verb in final position of the sentence. Sentences ending in a verb that assigned dative case to the ambiguous NP elicited a clear garden-path effect. The garden-path effect was indicated by a broad centro-posterior negative shift that occurred between 300 and 900 msec after the dative-assigning verb was presented. NPs whose case ambiguity was resolved in favor of accusative case and unambiguously dative-marked NPs did not trigger significant ERP differences. These results support a parser design according to which the so-called structural case is assigned without any delay in the absence of morpho-lexical counterevidence. It is argued that the enhancement of a negative ERP component with a classical N400 topography reflects the difficulty of reanalysis due to reaccessing morpho-lexical information that lies outside the domain of the parsing module. Consequently, ERP responses to garden-path effects are not confined to a late positivity but vary depending on the level of processing involved in reanalysis.

The reanalysis shows that relative strength of grouping into strips of dots of a particular orientation approximates a decreasing exponential function of the relative distance between dots in that orientation. The configural or wholistic properties that were varied—such as angular separations of the alternative organizations and the symmetry properties of the dot pattern—do not matter. Additionally, this grouping function is robust under transformations of scale in space (Exp 1) and time (Exp 2). Grouping of units which are themselves the result of a grouping (i.e., pairs of dots; Exp 3) also follows the nonconfigural rule. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The authors conclude that 36 months' isoniazid preventive therapy was more effective than a 6-month course, giving a 74% relative reduction in tuberculosis incidence. It took American Thoracic Society (ATS) a while to come full circle, declaring 6 months to be basically inadequate, after a reanalysis of Alaskan data had suggested that about 9 months were superior to 6 months, but not inferior to 20 months. It thus seems counter intuitive that 36 months were chosen to show the established ineffectiveness of 6 months in HIV infected people rather than 9 or 12 months. The most straightforward conclusion seems that 6 months of preventive therapy for HIV-infected people has never been shown to be appropriate. But the alternative is not 36 months, but rather 9–12 months, as long established. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article, The association between hydroxyurea treatment and pain intensity, analgesic use, and utilization in ambulatory sickle cell anemia patients by W.R. Smith et al. (2011). Their study was a reanalysis of the data generated by the gold standard trial of sickle cell disease pain prevention, the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) as treatment of pain in sickle cell disease. The original MSH used traditional methods for detecting pain crises to find that hydroxyurea therapy reduced the frequency of acute painful episodes. Their finding of a highly significant correlation of the small decrement in daily pain score with the MSH pain frequency data suggests that such small daily decrements in pain score could be acceptable regulatory end points. The additional finding by Dr. Smith and his associates that even the best responders in daily pain score had residual pain that greatly exceeded hydroxyurea-induced decrements in pain defines the need for better therapies. Their finding that contemporary measures for quantifying pain correlate significantly with traditional criteria suggests a new, less arduous but valid set of regulatory end points. While perhaps not the original goal of the current study, the findings of Smith et al. may in the long run influence regulatory policy and facilitate drug development.

Abstract = {Conducted 3 experiments concerning the processing of syntactic and semantic violations. 79 college students (aged 19–27 yrs) participated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that semantic violations elicited an N400 response, whereas syntactic violations elicited 2 early negativities (150 and 350 ms) and a P600 response. No interaction between the semantic and early syntactic ERP effects was found. Sentence complexity and violation probability (25% vs 75%) affected only the P600 and not the early negativities. The probability effect was taken as evidence that the P600 resembles the P3b. The temporal order of word processing in a sentence as suggested by the data was such that a more automatic syntactic analysis was performed (earlier syntactic-related negativities) in parallel with a semantic analysis (N400), after which a syntactic reanalysis was performed (P600). A reanalysis interpretation of the P600 could explain why the extent of the reanalysis differed with syntactic complexity and probability of ungrammaticality.

Abstract = {Presents an approach for studying measurement characteristics of instruments designed for comparative studies of educational achievement through a reanalysis of data from the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement reading literacy study (W. B. Elley, 1994) of 73,818 9–10-yr-old students from 22 countries. Using 2-level confirmatory factor analysis procedures, it is demonstrated how the overall variance in performance on items from 3 domains (Documents, Narrative Prose, and Expository Text) may be decomposed into multiple latent sources of variance at country and individual levels. For the Document items, a 1-factor model was fitted at both levels. For Narrative Prose and Expository Text items, 2 latent variables (a general dimension of reading performance and a factor capturing high versus low performance on passages towards the end of the tests) were fitted at both levels. For the Document dimension, estimates of country scores were close to those of the original analysis; however, for performance in the Narrative Prose and Expository Text domains, differences between the original analysis and the reanalysis were noted for many countries.

Abstract = {Reports the retraction of "Interaction between preexposure and overshadowing: Further analysis of the extended comparator hypothesis" by H. I. Savastano, F. Arcediano, S. C. Stout, and R. R. Miller (The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology B: Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 2003[Nov], Vol 56B[4], 371-395). Reanalysis of extensive published data collected in the animal learning and cognition laboratory at Binghamton University has detected errors in two data sets. Suppression ratios were incorrectly transcribed when the data were decoded. The corrected data in each instance maintains the reported ordinal relationships between groups, but fails to provide the inferential statistics necessary to support the asserted results. These reanalyses invalidate the conclusions of the article noted above and Savastano, H. I., & Miller, R. R. (2003). Biological significance and posttraining changes in conditioned responding. Learning and Motivation, 34, 303-324. Consequently, these articles are hereby retracted. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2003-09046-004[/rid].) Three experiments with rats used conditioned suppression of barpress to test predictions of the extended comparator hypothesis, which assumes that the effectiveness of (first-order) comparator stimuli in modulating responding to a target conditioned stimulus (CS) is itself modulated by other (second-order) comparator stimuli. Experiment 1 demonstrated that both pretraining exposure to the target CS alone and pretraining exposure to a compound of the target CS and nontarget CS counteract overshadowing, and that posttraining deflation of the overshadowing stimulus attenuates responding to the target CS when overshadowing is preceded by a CS-preexposure treatment, but not when overshadowing is preceded by a compound-CS-preexposure treatment. Experiment 2 examined the consequences of posttraining associative inflation of the overshadowing stimulus or the preexposure companion stimulus following conjoint compound-CS-preexposure and overshadowing treatment. Experiment 3 examined the consequences of posttraining inflation of the overshadowing stimulus or the context following conjoint CS-alone preexposure and overshadowing treatment. The results support the expression-focused comparator view in contrast to recent acquisition-focused models of retrospective revaluation.

Rybakowski and Marek Jarema (International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice, 2004[Sep], Vol 8[3], 147-152). During the course of monitoring and audit of one of the sites conducting a trial with paliperidone ER in subjects with schizophrenia, serious violations of GCP were found. All ongoing trials were terminated at this site. In addition, a review of previous trials undertaken by this site, including RIS-INT-59, was conducted. Although there was no evidence of violations of GCP in the past at this site, in order to be prudent and cautious, Janssen-Cilag decided to reanalyse the primary efficacy endpoints, after excluding all subjects who participated at this centre. It was also decided that, in order to be transparent, the results of this reanalysis would be conveyed to relevant regulatory authorities and journals. The results of this reanalysis are shown in the current article, which should replace Table 1 of the original paper. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2004-18255-002[/rid].) OBJECTIVE: The aim of this open multicenter international study was an assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone administered for 12 months in patients with early schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred and five patients, 113 male and 92 female, aged 15-46 years were included. The mean daily risperidone dose was 3.3 ± 1.4 mg/day and in three-quarters of patients the dose was in the range of 2-4 mg. For psychometric assessment the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were used. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two patients (64%) completed the study. Significant improvement (at least 20% reduction) was found on PANSS subscales for positive symptoms (89% of patients), negative symptoms (77% of patients), as well as for depressive symptoms measured by MADRS (78% of patients). Parkinsonian symptoms occurred in 53 patients (26.5%), necessitating the use of anticholinergic drugs. Risperidone treatment did not exert a significant effect on vital signs and on ECG recordings. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, in a substantial proportion of patients with early schizophrenia, risperidone can be successfully used for initiation of pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia and then be continued on the long-term basis.

Abstract = {DYSLEXPERT is a knowledge-based system designed to support clinicians in the diagnosis of dyslexia. The system answers 4 questions that usually have to be addressed by human clinicians: Which areas of psychological functioning appear to be problematic? What tests would provide the relevant information? Are we actually dealing with dyslexia? How can the reading and spelling problems best be alleviated? In this article, the authors compare the competence of the program to the performance of 4 experienced diagnosticians on 20 cases of dyslexia and 20 cases of nondyslexia. The evaluation of the competence of DYSLEXPERT was based on 3 sets of data: the original case work, a reanalysis of the cases, and the results produced by DYSLEXPERT. The agreement between human and computer performance was measured using Cohen's kappa and Dice's measure of specific agreement. Statistical testing revealed between DYSLEXPERT and the reanalysis to be similar between the original case work and the reanalysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In 1915 Edward Webb, working under Charles Spearman at University College London, reported a study of personality trait ratings of 194 trainee teachers. The original report found a single personality factor, which Webb named Persistence of Motives or w. Subsequent partial reanalyses and reinterpretations of Webb's data are reviewed and are found to be misleading. The quality of Webb's data is high; 2 raters assessed every student, and the raters' studies of the students' characters were unusually prolonged and intense. A new reanalysis of Webb's data analyzes 6- and 5-factor personality structures latent in the data set, which are judged by experts to be congruent with current 5-factor and other models of human personality trait structure. Therefore, the first, albeit latent, discovery of some currently recognized broad personality dimensions came from the department that is the birthplace of differential psychology.

Past research has indicated that attitudes can be based on different types of psychological information or components, such as emotions and beliefs. It has also been suggested that the amount of ambivalence and inconsistency between and within these components are important aspects of attitude structure. In this paper, the authors discuss the relation between ambivalence and inconsistency, and their effects on message processing. Based on past theorizing and research, and on the reanalyses of previous data (G. R.

Abstract = {Describes how the competitive attachment model explains a number of recency effects in parsing as the result of both its symbolic and numeric aspects of local distributed processing through a network. A demonstration is given of how the decay of phrasal activation affects the outcome of attachment competitions, accounting for recency effects in initial attachment preferences. A description is given of how the same factors affect reanalysis as well. Because initial and revised attachments are determined within a single competitive attachment operation, recency effects in both attachment preferences and reanalysis are thus shown to result from a single, independently motivated mechanism. How the competition mechanism, in conjunction with the feature passing mechanism, also leads to recency effects in filler/gap processing is explained.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Pollet and Nettle (henceforth, P&N) (see record [rid]2009-01590-009[/rid]). P&N used ordinal regression models to investigate the effect of indicators of male quality, height and income, on self-reported female orgasm frequency. The strategy was as follows: in the first step the two key variables, male height and male income, were included. Subsequently, height was removed as it proved not to be a significant predictor at 5% level. Then, using an information theoretic approach, the authors examined whether model fit could be improved by adding control variables and stopped when the model could not be further improved as assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). P&N concluded that the best-fitting model contained partner income as a predictor. The authors used ordinal regression models to investigate the effect of indicators of male quality, height and income, on self-reported female orgasm frequency. To obtain the parameter estimates in an ordinal regression model, the data are often pooled into groups according to the values of the covariates, and the likelihood of the grouped data is maximized, instead of the likelihood of the individual data. It turned out that P&N used a software implementation (SPSS 15.0) which by default calculates the log likelihood including the constant. Thus, the AIC and BIC values given were not correct, and the model selection strategy was affected. The results confirm that partner income is associated with orgasm frequency, and this association is robust to control for female age and education. However, unlike P&N, the reanalysis shows that the model fit can be improved by adding more variables, until the point where the effect of partner income is not significant anymore. This conclusion is reinforced by using alternative model selection strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {17 nicotine-regulation studies were reanalyzed using a unit-price analysis (i.e., cost-benefit analysis). A positively decelerating demand curve was found across most studies, consistent with previous unit-price analyses of food- and drug-maintained behavior. The reanalysis suggests a nonlinear relationship between nicotine yield and nicotine consumption. This reanalysis also shows that nicotine yields higher than the smoker's usual brand decrease smoke consumption and thus decrease consumption of the harmful agents in tobacco. Results suggest the value of behavioral economics in the study of consumptive behaviors and clinically suggest that decreasing the smoker's usual nicotine yield can have potential health risks for smokers who are unable to stop smoking.

D. Gibbons et al. (2012) & Suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant treatment: Reanalysis of the randomized placebo-controlled studies of fluoxetine and venlafaxine by R. D. Gibbons et al. (2012). These two papers by Robert Gibbons and his colleagues may be helpful as one considers treatment options for depression in youth. Using both published and unpublished data on fluoxetine and venlafaxine, in a meta-analysis of intent-to-treat person-level longitudinal data during the first six weeks of treatment, the authors were able to demonstrate not only that SSRIs are effective in treating depression. Even more striking was the fact that youth had the largest treated versus control difference. Underlying this report was the analysis of data on over 4,000 patients from both published and unpublished studies of fluoxetine—youth were not treated with venlafaxine. Some may argue that the differences in these data are small and that they only involve two medications; however, these findings are clinically significant even though they are from very early in the course of treatment. Indeed, they might even be construed as reassuring. Therefore, despite the storms in the media and the FDA black box warning, it appears that there are significant signals that supports the use of SSRIs to treat appropriately diagnosed and clinically managed children and adolescents.

Small (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 2005[Jun], Vol 11[2], 124-139). It was found that the second author on the original paper, Roxana M. Gonzalez, falsified data in connection with certain research projects. Researchers not involved in this original project were engaged to repeat all analyses reported in the article, starting with the original, untainted data for the study. Based on this reanalysis, a corrected version of the article is now being published. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2005-07160-006[/rid].) The authors examined the evolution of cognitive and emotional responses to terror risks for a nationally representative sample of Americans between late 2001 and late 2002. Respondents' risk judgments changed in ways consistent with their reported personal experiences. However, they did not recognize these changes, producing hindsight bias in memories for their judgments. An intensive debiasing procedure failed to restore a foresightful perspective. A fear-inducing manipulation increased risk estimates, whereas an anger-inducing manipulation reduced them-both in predictions (as previously observed) and in memories and judgments of past risks. Thus, priming emotions shaped not only perceptions of an abstract future but also perceptions of a concrete past. These results suggest how psychological research can help to ensure an informed public. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The study of dynamic and nonlinear change has been a valuable development in psychotherapy process research. However, little advancement has been made in describing how moment-by-moment affective processes contribute to larger units of change. The purpose of this study was to examine observable moment-by-moment sequences in emotional processing as they occurred within productive sessions of experiential therapy. This article further tested A. Pascual-Leone and L. S. Greenberg's (2007) model of emotional processing through a reanalysis of their data sample of 34 sessions in which clients presented with global distress: 17 that ended in poor in-session events and 17 that ended in good in-session events. Current analyses used univariate and bootstrapping statistical methods to examine how dynamic temporal patterns in clients' emotion accumulated moment-by-moment to produce in-session gains in emotional processing. Results show that effective emotional processing was simultaneously associated with steady improvement according to the model as well as increased emotional range. Consequentially, good events were shown to occur in a 2-steps-forward, 1-step-back fashion. Finally, good events were also shown to have progressively shortened emotional collapses, whereas the opposite was true for poor in-session events.

Abstract = {The article discusses how Jacobs and Carmichael, drawing on the racial threat thesis, argue that the overrepresentation of Blacks among felons who murder police is in part explained by Blacks’ conscious or unconscious responses to political subordination by the State. In testing this argument, Jacobs and Carmichael find that their key theoretical variable—the presence of a Black mayor—is inversely related to police homicides and injurious assaults across many model specifications. This article describes a limited reanalysis of Jacobs and Carmichael’s homicide data and additional analyses with a larger sample of cities. The findings suggest that the significance of the Black mayor variable may have been an artifact of model specification. Instead, there is evidence that Black city council representation may be associated with reduced homicides of police by Blacks. Further research is needed, however, because of the limited explanatory power of the key factors highlighted in past research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The standard view maintains that quantifier scope interpretation results from an interaction between different modules: the syntax, the semantics as well as the pragmatics. Thus, by examining the mechanism of quantifier scope interpretation, we will certainly gain some insight into how these different modules interact with one another. To observe it, two experiments, an offline judgment task and an eye-tracking experiment, were conducted to investigate the interpretation of doubly quantified sentences in Chinese, like Mei-ge qiangdao dou qiang-le yi-ge yinhang (Every robber robbed a bank). According to current literature, doubly quantified sentences in Chinese like the above are unambiguous, which can only be interpreted as "for every robber x, there is a bank y, such that x robbed y" (surface scope reading), contrary to their ambiguous English counterparts, which also allow the interpretation that "there is a bank y, such that for every robber x, x robbed y" (inverse scope reading). Specifically, three questions were examined, that is, (i) What is the initial reading of doubly quantified sentences in Chinese? (ii) Whether inverse scope interpretation can be available if appropriate contexts are provided? (iii) What are the processing time courses engaged in quantifier scope interpretation? The results showed that (i) Initially, the language processor computes the surface scope representation and the inverse scope representation in parallel, thus, doubly quantified sentences in Chinese are ambiguous; (ii) The discourse information is not employed in initial processing of relative scope, it serves to evaluate the two representations in reanalysis; (iii) The lexical information of verbs affects their scope-taking patterns. We suggest that these findings provide evidence for the Modular Model, one of the major contenders in the literature on sentence processing.

Abstract = {The present research examined the developmental course of racial behaviours in childhood. It tested the hypothesis that White children's expressions of racial prejudice do not necessarily decline in middle childhood due to the development of particular cognitive skills but that instead, as argued by the socio-normative approach, children older than seven will go on expressing prejudiced attitudes under appropriate conditions. This would be explained by the presence of an anti-racism norm, along with the existence of values promoting equal rights, which impede blatant expressions of racism. In the first study 283 White children aged 6-7 and 9-10 years performed a task of resource allocation to White and Black target children in conditions of high (White interviewer was present) or low (White interviewer was absent) salience of the anti-racist norm. The 6- to 7-year-old children discriminated against the Black target in both conditions whereas older children discriminated against the Black child only when the anti-racist norm was not salient. In Study 2, 187 White children aged 6-7 and 9-10 years performed the same resource allocation task in conditions of explicit activation of similarity vs dissimilarity or egalitarian vs merit-based norms regarding race relations. Supporting the hypothesis of the role of racist or anti-racist norms on the expression of intergroup discrimination, results have again shown that 6- to 7- year-old children discriminated against the Black target in both conditions while older children presented significantly different prejudiced/non-prejudiced behaviours consistent with the activated norms. These results were discussed in terms of the need for a reanalysis of the assumptions and research results of the cognitive developmental theory and of further developments in the socio-normative approach regarding the development of prejudice in childhood.

First, we discuss how best to assess color term knowledge when concerned with the effects of language on color CP. A reanalysis of our data indicates that even toddlers who do not know the terms for the relevant focal colors still show CP. Second, we comment on Goldstein and colleagues' finding of blue-purple CP, as we did, but not of blue-green CP in Himba toddlers. We present contrasting data from Wright (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Surrey, 2006) that demonstrates blue-green CP in Himba toddlers. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the approach taken by all of these investigations and discuss theoretical accounts of the origin and nature of color CP.

Abstract = {In the recent literature (Adamson 2000; Paradis 2000; Athanasiadou 2007; Traugott 2007a, 2007b), the development of 'emphasizing' meanings by prenominal elements of the English NP is generally envisaged along a path leading from descriptive, prepositional meaning to emphasizing meaning (e.g. from a complete sentence to complete nonsense; cf. Paradis 2000: 245). However, earlier Bolinger (1972: 59, 60) had posited an alternative path for elements that also express determining meanings, i.e. from determining to emphasizing meaning (e.g. from the complete period to a complete foot). This paper will assess these opposed claims about the origin of emphasizing uses by means of a data-based study of the development of two adjectives, particular and specific, that have descriptive, determining, as well as emphasizing uses. Reconstmction of the various meaning extensions and structural reanalyses that have affected the adjectives indicates that the now mostly neglected determining uses are an essential step in the subjectification process to emphasizing meanings and they can shed new light on both the chronology and the conceptual mechanisms involved in the syntactic-semantic shifts.

Abstract = {Developmental dyscalculia (DD) still lacks a generally accepted definition. A major problem is that the cognitive component processes contributing to arithmetic performance are still poorly defined. By a reanalysis of our previous event-related brain potential (ERP) data (Soltész et al., 2007) here our objective was to identify and compare cognitive processes in adolescents with DD and in matched control participants in one-digit number comparison. To this end we used temporal principal component analysis (PCA) on ERP data. First, PCA has identified four major components explaining the 85.8% of the variance in number comparison. Second, the ERP correlate of the most frequently used marker of the so-called magnitude representation, the numerical distance effect, was intact in DD during all processing stages identified by PCA. Third, hemispheric differences in the first temporal component and group differences in the second temporal component suggest executive control differences between DD and controls.

Abstract = {The present article reanalyzed data collected by Toomela (2003). The data contain personality self ratings and cognitive ability test results from n = 912 men with military background. In his original article Toomela showed that in the group with the highest cognitive ability, Big-Five-Neuroticism and -Conscientiousness were substantially correlated and could no longer be clearly separated using exploratory factor analysis. The present reanalysis was based on the hypothesis that a spurious measurement error caused by situational demand was responsible. This means, people distorted their answers. Furthermore it was hypothesized that this situational demand was felt due to a person’s military rank but not due to his intelligence. Using a multi group structural equation model our hypothesis could be confirmed. Moreover, the results indicate that an uncorrelated trait model might represent personalities better when situational demand is partialized. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to outline the fundamental assumptions regarding the laddering methodology (Reynolds and Gutman), examine how some “hard” laddering approaches meet or violate these assumptions, provide a review and comparison of a series of studies using “soft” and “hard” laddering approaches to examine the hierarchical structure of means-end theory, and assess if the discrepant conclusions from this series of studies may be attributed to violations of the fundamental assumptions of the laddering methodology. Design/methodology/approach: A series of published empirical works using “hard” and “soft” laddering approaches, which aim to examine the hierarchical structure of means-end theory (Gutman), are reviewed and compared to integrate research findings and to examine discrepancies. Discrepant conclusions, which appear to be attributable to violations of the assumptions underlying the laddering methodology, are explored through a reanalysis and reclassification of the content codes. Findings: The paper validates the case for laddering and the care needed to gauge how conclusions can be affected when violations of fundamental assumptions of the laddering methodology occur. Research limitations/implications: Means-end chain research and,more specifically, the laddering methodology are in need of investigations that assess the importance of its underlying assumptions. Additional work validating both the “hard” and “soft” laddering approaches is also needed. Practical implications" Results of means-end research are more interpretable and less ambiguous when the fundamental assumptions of the laddering methodology are met. In practice, means-end theory benefits managers by providing a useful structure to aid in the interpretation of laddering data. Originality/value: This paper outlines the fundamental assumptions regarding the laddering methodology to provide methodological guidelines for laddering researchers. This paper also reviews the academic literature examining the hierarchical structure of means-end theory and explores how violations of the fundamental assumptions of the laddering methodology may impact research findings.

Abstract = {The investigation of canine personality has failed to find strong agreement between studies as to its structure. The area has been hampered by a reliance on human personality models and by a tendency to limit the types of dogs used as subjects. These problems were recently addressed during the development of the Monash Canine Personality Questionnaire (MCPQ). In this follow-up study, over 450 participants provided demographic information about themselves and their dog and completed the MCPQ for their dog. Structural Equation Modelling results necessitated reassessing the original data and reanalysis suggested a more succinct questionnaire, the MCPQ-R, to measure five dimensions of canine personality very similar to those revealed in earlier work (extraversion, motivation, training focus, amicability and neuroticism). Owner reports of personality were generally consistent across demographic variables for all five canine personality subscales. There was no association between any subscale score and owner gender or education level, or dog sex or sexual status (desexed or not desexed). Significant, but generally weak associations were found for owner age and Extraversion (r = 0.17, P < 0.001), owner knowledge of their dog and Training Focus (r = 0.22, P < 0.001), time spent inside and Extraversion (r = -0.13, P = 0.007), dog age and Extraversion (r = 0.14, P = 0.004), Training Focus and Extraversion (r = 0.13, P = 0.007), dog height and Neuroticism (r = -0.20, P < 0.001) and dog height and Amicability (r = 0.2, P < 0.001), dog weight and Neuroticism (r = -0.17, P < 0.01) and dog weight and Amicability (r = 0.19, P < 0.01). There were also few differences in personality ratings across recognised purebred dog breed groups, although Working Dogs and Terriers scored significantly more highly on the Extraverted subscale than other groups (P < 0.001) and Working Dogs and Gundogs scored more highly on the Training Focus subscale (P < 0.001). These results are consistent with the view that the MCPQ-R assesses a construct, canine personality, which is relatively stable and comprised of five dimensions.

In so doing, we address their repeated criticism that the avoidance subscale of the Impact of Event Scale was omitted from the original analyses.

We call for a consistent analytic strategy, emphasize the need for replication with larger samples, and urge caution in the extrapolation of experimental findings to clinical recommendations.

Abstract = {Objectives: To develop the pharmacists’ care of migraineurs scale (PCMS) and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Background: Migraine is often managed suboptimally in primary care. Migraineurs frequently come into contact with community pharmacists, who have the opportunity to make a positive impact on migraineur treatment outcomes. A valid and reliable tool that measures and documents the care provided by pharmacists to migraineurs is critical to the development and evaluation of educational programs and interventions. Methods: Relevant domains of pharmacist care and their respective composite items (behaviors) were identified through an extensive literature search and the use of 2 pharmacist and 2 migraineur focus groups sessions. The resultant 45 PCMS items composed a survey questionnaire mailed to a nationwide random sample of 6000 pharmacists. Data were subjected to an exploratory principal axis factoring procedure to discern the factor structure, and as such describe the latent domains composing the pharmacist caring behaviors constructs. Results: A total of 580 usable responses were returned, with an additional 60 returned as undeliverable, thus yielding a response rate of 9.7%. Exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring yielded 9 factors. However, upon examining the scree plot, commonalities, and factor loadings, a reanalysis forcing a 7-factor solution yielded a more interpretable and plausible factor structure. The 7-factor solution included the following domains: (1) empathy; (2) prospective drug utilization review for newly diagnosed migraineurs; (3) medication counseling; (4) non pharmacologic treatment plan; (5) headache sufferer triage; (6) dissemination of public health information; (7) maintenance of knowledge on migraine. Following the application of scale purification procedures, the final instrument is composed of 41 items and demonstrated a Cronbach’s alpha reliability of 0.947. Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities for the 7 domains ranged from 0.67 to 0.91, indicative of good to excellent internal consistency reliabilities for all the domains. Conclusions: The PCMS demonstrated very good construct validity and reliability. While additional validity testing is warranted, the PCMS should allow for benchmarking in the evaluation of interventions designed to improve pharmacists’ care to migraineurs and for identifying correlates to effective community pharmacist migraineur care.

Abstract = {This paper is one of a pair that re-examines the evidence from a national initiative to train all teachers in England to bring them up to the level of newly qualified teachers, who are required to know when to use and when not to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in their professional practice. Reanalysis of data gathered for the 2004 evaluation uncovers the complexity of such professional development. The effectiveness of contrasting approaches to ICT-related teacher training was analyzed using the national survey of 496 trainees and experts' reports on 11 of the 47 training providers. multilevel evaluation of professional development was shown to be robust for ICT teacher training, including a significant correlation between the views of experts and those of teachers. The presence of the middle level of 'organizational support and change' emerged as a particularly discriminating factor, indicating that higher-quality teacher training supports change in the classroom and in the school. Therefore, we recommend that all five of Guskey's levels be consistently adopted for the evaluation of ICT teacher training, and that research should also adopt a multilevel model. A second paper delves deeper to describe and contrast the highest and lowest-rated approaches to ICT teacher training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Using a forced-choice question-answering paradigm, K. Christianson, A. Hollingworth, J. F. Halliwell, and F. Ferreira (2001) showed that the original misinterpretation built during the analysis of a garden-path sentence lingers even after reanalysis has occurred. However, their methodology has been questioned (R. P. G. van Gompel, M. J. Pickering, J. Pearson, & G. Jacob, 2006). In this study, the authors report evidence for lingering misinterpretations using a paraphrasing methodology, which is less biased than previous methodologies. Using paraphrasing, they found that garden-path sentences are paraphrased according to a partially reanalyzed interpretation. This finding suggests that the arguments put forward by Christianson et al. are correct: Comprehenders' final interpretations of sentences are often incorrect and do not correspond to the initial input. These findings support the theory that comprehension can occur in a "good-enough" manner (F. Ferreira, V. Ferraro, & K. G. D. Bailey, 2002; F. Ferreira & N. Patson, 2007).

Abstract = {The present research investigated the influence of multiple sequential primes on social categorization processes. Study 1 examined an evaluative decision task in which targets were preceded and succeeded by two primes. As expected, the temporally closest forward primes had assimilative effects on target processing. Moreover, if the temporally closest forward prime and the target were congruent, backward affective primes had assimilative effects; if the temporally closest forward prime and the target were incongruent, the distal forward primes had contrastive effects. Study 2 found similar effects in a gender priming task. In a reanalysis of Gawronski, Deutsch, and Seidel (2005), Study 3 partly replicated Studies 1 and 2 with more complex and varied stimuli. The results indicate that people can flexibly extract and disentangle brief snapshots from a continuous stream of environmental stimulation.

Abstract = {One widely accepted empirical regularity in free recall holds that when people successively transition from report of one list item to another, they prefer transitions across short lags (e.g., by reporting items from adjacent serial positions) to transitions involving large lags. This regularity has provided crucial support for the temporal context model (TCM), a model of the evolution of temporal context in episodic memory (Howard & Kahana, 2002a). We report a reanalysis of 14 data sets that shows that, contrary to the presumed preference for short lags, people often produce transitions with larger lags during recall. We show that these data cannot be accommodated by the TCM. We furthermore show that existing applications of the model have, for mathematical convenience, introduced assumptions that have circumvented its core principle of context evolution. When we instantiated the TCM as it was actually described, with a gradually evolving context, we found that its behavior qualitatively departed from that of the version currently implemented, but that the model was still unable to capture the nature of transitions in free recall. We conclude that the TCM requires further modification and development before it can explain the data that constitute its main source of support.

Abstract = {Numerous earlier studies have investigated the cognitive processing of musical syntax with regular and irregular chord sequences. However, irregular sequences may also be perceived as unexpected, and therefore have a different emotional valence than regular sequences. We provide behavioral data showing that irregular chord functions presented in chord sequence paradigms are perceived as less pleasant than regular sequences. A reanalysis of functional MRI data showed increased blood oxygen level dependent signal changes bilaterally in the amygdala in response to music-syntactically irregular (compared with regular) chord functions. The combined data indicate that music-syntactically irregular events elicit brain activity related to emotional processes, and that, in addition to intensely pleasurable music or highly unpleasant music, single chord functions can also modulate amygdala activity.

Abstract = {The Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans situation was commonly called a "natural disaster"--an anomalous "event" that disrupted lives, spaces, and organizations. Research and planning attention then focused on particular aspects of the event and on restoring order. In contrast, sociologists and similar-thinking scholars have increasingly viewed disaster situations from multiple locations and histories, often using systems theory. Here, reanalysis of empirical material from ethnographic research in New Orleans pre- and post-Katrina suggests that a sociological embeddedness perspective illustrates the dynamic seamlessness of past, present, and future economic contexts and social actions. The perspective's constitutive concepts of weak, strong, and differentiated ties highlight the role of local knowledge, intermediary-led workforce networks, and sustained participatory planning in creating a robust economic environment. Toward this end, disaster research, planning, and theory building could incorporate network tie assessments into social vulnerability protocols, compare embeddedness with other perspectives, and learn from related international experiences.

Abstract = {A large research literature on procedural justice demonstrates that people are more accepting of decisions that they do not feel are advantageous or fair when those decisions are arrived at using just procedures. Recently, several papers (Skitka, Pers Soc Psychol Bull, 28:588-597, 2002; Skitka and Mullen, Pers Soc Psychol Bull, 28:1419-1429, 2002) have argued that these procedural mechanisms do not have a significant influence when the decision made concerns issues about which those involved have strong moral feelings ("a moral mandate"). A reanalysis of the data in these two studies indicates that, contrary to the strong position taken by the authors, i.e. that "when people have a moral mandate about an outcome, any means justifies the mandated end" (Skitka, Pers Soc Psychol Bull, 28:594, 2002), the justice of decision-making procedures is consistently found to significantly influence people's reactions to decisions by authorities and institutions even when their moral mandates are threatened.

Abstract = {We examined 14 patients with acute anteromedial pontomesencephalic infarctions for signs of vestibular and ocular motor dysfunction. In all cases, an isolated ipsilateral deviation of the subjective visual vertical (mean: 4.1, range: 2.7–6.6) was found without any further signs of vestibular or eye movement disorders like ocular torsion or skew deviation. Distinct lesions in thin-slice brainstem MRI showed an overlap zone in the medial portion of the medial lemniscus. The finding of putative ipsilateral vestibular projections running adjacent to or within the medial lemniscus was subsequently confirmed by a reanalysis of an anterograde tracer labelling study in the primate after tracer injection in the vestibular nucleus complex. The major conclusions of this study are as follows: (i) there is evidence for an ipsilateral graviceptive pathway running from the vestibular nuclei close to and within the medial lemniscus to the posterolateral thalamus [ipsilateral vestibulothalamic tract (IVTT)], (ii) this pathway might be the human homologue of the three-neuron sensory vestibulocortical tract described in primates and (iii) unilateral lesions of this pathway cause only vestibulo-perceptive dysfunction in the roll plane in contrast to lesions of the crossed graviceptive pathways (in the medial longitudinal fascicle), which were described earlier and which manifest as a combination of tilt of the subjective visual vertical, ocular torsion and skew deviation.

Abstract = {Dow and Eff recently reported high levels of network autocorrelation for over eleven hundred and fifty variables coded for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) with respect to five distinct measures of network proximity: distance, language, cultural complexity, religion, and ecological niche. Most of the variables were discrete, either binary or ordinal, as are the vast majority of variables in all cross-cultural samples. A large percentage showed significant levels of autocorrelation with respect to two or more networks simultaneously. One implication of these findings is that there is a need in comparative research for statistical models that can deal with binary and ordinal dependent variables while simultaneously controlling for one or more autocorrelation process. The current paper suggests one such regression modeling procedure and applies it in a reanalyses of the causes of polygyny. Both spatial autocorrelation by itself, and spatial and language autocorrelation in combination, were found to be significant predictors of polygyny.

Abstract = {Following William James (1890/1963), many leading self-esteem researchers continue to support the Individual-importance hypothesis—that the relation between specific facets of self-concept and global self-esteem depends on the importance an individual places on each specific facet. However, empirical support for the hypothesis is surprisingly elusive, whether evaluated in terms of an importance-weighted average model, a generalized multiple regression approach for testing self-concept-by-importance interactions, or idiographic approaches. How can actual empirical support for such an intuitively appealing and widely cited psychological principle be so elusive? Hardy and Moriarty (2006), acknowledging this previous failure of the Individual-importance hypothesis, claim to have solved the conundrum, demonstrating an innovative idiographic approach that provides clear support for it. However, a critical evaluation of their new approach, coupled with a reanalysis of their data, undermines their claims. Indeed, their data provide compelling support against the Individual-importance hypothesis, which remains as elusive as ever. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The original multivariate analyses which used the class as the unit of analysis were supplemented by similar analyses using the student as the unit of analysis and multilevel analyses. While multilevel analyses yielded tests of significance results similar to multivariate analyses conducted with the class as the unit of analysis, effect sizes for the multilevel analyses were similar to those reported for multivariate tests conducted with the student as the unit of analysis.

Abstract = {Purpose: S. Rvachew and M. Grawburg (see record [rid]2007-06577-006[/rid]) found that speech perception and vocabulary skills jointly predicted the phonological awareness skills of children with a speech sound disorder. E. Hartmann (see record [rid]2008-14543-012[/rid]) suggested that the Rvachew and Grawburg model would be improved by the addition of phonological working memory. Hartmann further suggested that the link between phoneme awareness and letter knowledge should be modeled as a reciprocal relationship. In this letter, Rvachew and Grawburg respond to Hartmann's suggestions for modification of the model. Method: The literature on the role of phonological working memory in the development of vocabulary knowledge and phonological awareness was reviewed. Data presented previously by Rvachew and Grawburg (2006) and Rvachew (2006) were reanalyzed. Results: The reanalysis of previously reported longitudinal data revealed that the relationship between letter knowledge and specific aspects of phonological awareness was not reciprocal for kindergarten-age children with a speech sound disorder. Conclusions: Phonological working memory, if measured so that relative performance levels do not reflect differences in articulatory accuracy, may not alter the model because of its close correspondence with speech perception skills. However, further study of the hypothesized causal relationships modeled by Rvachew and Grawburg (2006) would be valuable, especially if experimental research designs were used.

Abstract = {Ambivalence researchers often collapse separate measures of positivity and negativity into a single numerical index of ambivalence and refer to it as objective, operative, or potential ambivalence. The authors argue that this univariate approach to ambivalence models undermines the validity of subsequent statistical analyses because it confounds the effects of the index and its components. To remedy this situation, they demonstrate how the assumptions underlying the indices derived from the conflicting reactions model and similarity-intensity model can be tested using a multivariate approach to ambivalence models. On the basis of computer simulations and reanalyses of published moderator effects, the authors show that the frequently reported moderating influence of ambivalence on attitude effects may be a statistical artifact resulting from unmodeled correlations of positivity and negativity with attitude and the dependent variable. On the basis of extensive power analyses, they conclude that it may be extremely difficult to detect moderator effects of ambivalence in observational data. Therefore, they encourage ambivalence researchers to take an experimental approach to study design and a multivariate approach to data analysis.

Abstract = {It remains controversial whether the left inferior frontal gyrus subserves syntactic processing or short-term memory demands. Here we devised a novel picture-sentence matching task involving Japanese sentences with different structures to clearly contrast syntactic reanalysis processes. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), activations under three main conditions were directly compared: a canonical/subject-initial active sentence (AS), a noncanonical/subject-initial passive sentence (PS), and a noncanonical/object-initial scrambled sentence (SS). We found that activation in the dorsal region of the left inferior frontal gyrus (dF3t) was enhanced more by the noncanonical processing under the PS and SS conditions than by the canonical processing under the AS condition, and this enhancement was independent of domain-general factors, such as general memory demands and task difficulty. Moreover, the left posterior superior/middle temporal gyrus (pSTG/MTG) showed more enhanced responses to object-initial sentences under the SS condition than to subject-initial sentences under the AS and PS conditions, which were not significantly affected by task difficulty. Furthermore, activation in the left lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) increased under the AS, PS, and SS conditions, in that order. It is possible that task difficulty affects the left LPMC, but the three distinct activations patterns suggest that these frontal and temporal regions work in concert to process syntactic structures, with their respective contributions dynamically regulated by linguistic requirements.

Abstract = {Event-related potentials were used to investigate the interaction of verbal working memory and gender information during pronoun resolution. Gender information is supposed to be disentangled using sentences about persons (semantic/syntactic) or things (syntactic) followed by gender congruent or incongruent pronouns. Memory was manipulated using differential distances (short distance (SD) and long distances with or without intermediate subject gaps (LD gap and LD no gap)) between the pronoun and the antecedent. Comparing incongruent to congruent conditions, person sentences with SD and LD no gap resulted in an N400-like effect indicating the involvement of semantic integration, whereas a P600 effect in LD gap (re-activated antecedents) sentences suggested the involvement of syntactic reanalysis. SD-thing sentences showed a P600 effect, whereas LD thing sentences revealed no effect at pronoun position. A delayed N400 effect for thing sentences was observed instead. Based on preceding and the current data, we present a working model on how the parser switches between the use of semantic and syntactic information to establish co-reference and how this switch depends on the type of antecedent, distance, or syntactic structure.

Abstract = {A morphosyntactic agreement violation during reading elicits a well-documented biphasic ERP pattern (LAN+P600). The cognitive variables that affect both the amplitude of the two components and the topography of the anterior negativity are still debated. We studied the ERP correlates of the violation of a specific agreement feature based on the phonology of the critical word. This was compared with the violation of a lexical feature, namely grammatical gender. These two features are different both in the level of representation involved in the agreement computation and in terms of their role in establishing structural relations with possible following constituents. The ERP pattern elicited by the two agreement violations showed interesting dissociations. The LAN was distributed ventrally for both types of violation, but showed a central extension for the gender violation. The P600 showed an amplitude modulation: this component was larger for phonotactic violations in its late time window (700-900 ms). The former result is indicative of a difference in the brain structures recruited for the processing of violations at different levels of representation. The P600 effect is interpreted assuming a hierarchical relation among features that forces a deeper reanalysis of the violation involving a word form property. Finally the two features elicit distinct end-of-sentence wrap-up effects, consistent with the different roles they play in the processing of the whole sentence.

Abstract = {Speech comprehension has been shown to be a strikingly bilateral process, but the differential contributions of the subfields of left and right auditory cortices have remained elusive. The hypothesis that left auditory areas engage predominantly in decoding fast temporal perturbations of a signal whereas the right areas are relatively more driven by changes of the frequency spectrum has not been directly tested in speech or music. This brain-imaging study independently manipulated the speech signal itself along the spectral and the temporal domain using noise-band vocoding. In a parametric design with five temporal and five spectral degradation levels in word comprehension, a functional distinction of the left and right auditory association cortices emerged: increases in the temporal detail of the signal were most effective in driving brain activation of the left anterolateral superior temporal sulcus (STS), whereas the right homolog areas exhibited stronger sensitivity to the variations in spectral detail. In accordance with behavioral measures of speech comprehension acquired in parallel, change of spectral detail exhibited a stronger coupling with the STS BOLD signal. The relative pattern of lateralization (quantified using lateralization quotients) proved reliable in a jack-knifed iterative reanalysis of the group functional magnetic resonance imaging model. This study supplies direct evidence to the often implied functional distinction of the two cerebral hemispheres in speech processing. Applying direct manipulations to the speech signal rather than to low-level surrogates, the results lend plausibility to the notion of complementary roles for the left and right superior temporal sulci in comprehending the speech signal.

Abstract = {In a sentence-picture verification paradigm, participants were presented in a rapid-serial-visual-presentation paradigm with affirmative or negative sentences (e.g., "In the front of the tower there is a/no ghost") followed by a matching or mismatching picture. Response latencies and event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured during reading and verification. An enhanced negative shift in the ERPs for the subject noun (i.e., "ghost") in negative, compared to affirmative sentences, was found during reading. We relate this ERP deflection to enhanced processing demands required by the negative particle no. Although this effect suggests a direct impact of negation on language processing, results for picture processing reveal that negation is not immediately integrated into sentence meaning. When the delay of picture presentation was short (250 msec), verification latencies and ERPs evoked by the picture showed a priming effect independent of whether the sentence contained a negation. Unprimed pictures (foreground object not mentioned in the sentence) led to longer latencies and higher N400 amplitudes than primed pictures (foreground object mentioned in the sentence). Main effects of negation showed up only in a late positive-going ERP effect. In contrast, when the delay was long (1500 msec), we observed main effects of truth value and negation in addition to the priming effect already in the N400 time window, that is, negation is fully integrated into sentence meaning only at a later point in the comprehension process. When negation has not yet been integrated, verification decisions appear to be modulated by additional time-consuming reanalysis processes.

Abstract = {Background: The Depression, Anxiety, and Positive Outlook Scale (DAPOS) was designed to measure mood in pain populations without contamination from somatic items. Aims: The current study examined responsiveness, internal consistency, and construct validity in pain patients. Method: A questionnaire survey before and after a multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention was completed by chronic pain patients, the majority of whom had back pain. Results: The DAPOS showed excellent internal consistency (N = 222, Cronbach α = 0.86 for the Depression subscale, 0.90 for the Anxiety subscale, and 0.74 for the Positive Outlook subscale) and construct validity (N = 82) in comparison with a variety of measures (SF-36; Pain Catastrophizing Scale; Zung Depression). Responsiveness was acceptable (ranging between 0.5 and 0.7, for both the mean change in score after treatment to the variability in patients at baseline, and the standardized response mean), although considerably lower than the Zung Depression Inventory. However, reanalysis without somatic items rendered the responsiveness of the Zung inadequate, indicating that change on this measure was due almost entirely to change in somatic symptoms without change in mood. Conclusions: Responsiveness of the DAPOS should be reassessed in treatment targeting mood change explicitly. The DAPOS scales show acceptable clinimetric and psychometric properties, and add a measurement of positive outlook to create a more balanced indication of mood in pain patients.

Finally, they report reanalyses of the 2 main MBCT trials with multilevel modeling that corrected for intragroup correlations. These analyses reinforce the original findings: For patients with 3 or more previous episodes, MBCT significantly reduced the risk of a further episode of depression and significantly decreased mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (A.

Abstract = {The main aim of the present novel reanalysis of archival data was to compare the time to remission during 12 weeks of treatment of chronic depression following antidepressant medication (n = 218), psychotherapy (n = 216), and their combination (n = 222). Cox regression survival analyses revealed that the combination of medication and psychotherapy produced full remission from chronic depression more rapidly than either of the single modality treatments, which did not differ from each other. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to explore predictors (treatment group, demographic, clinical, and psychosocial) of remission. For those receiving the combination treatment, the most likely to succeed were those with low baseline depression (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD; M. Hamilton, 1967] score < 26) and those with high depression scores but low anxiety (HRSD ≥ 26 and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [M. Hamilton, 1959] < 14). Both profiles were associated with at least 40% chance of attaining full remission. The model did not identify predictors for those receiving medication or psychotherapy alone, and it did not distinguish between the 2 monotherapies. The authors conclude that combined antidepressant medications and psychotherapy result in faster full remission of chronic forms of major depressive disorder.

In the present study, we examined the functional relevance of the GABRA2 gene in alcohol dependence by assessing brain GABRA2 mRNA and GABAA α2-subunit protein levels in post-mortem prefrontal cortical tissue collected from control and alcohol-dependent individuals. In addition, using an endophenotype approach, we tested whether the GABRA2 gene moderates sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol in two independent samples from distinct human alcohol challenge studies. Results indicated that GABRA2 mRNA levels significantly differed by GABRA2 genotype. GABRA2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs573400, rs279871 and rs279858) were significantly associated with sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol. Specifically, there was a significant main effect of GABRA2 × breath alcohol concentration on several measures of subjective responses to alcohol, including the hedonic value of alcohol. Importantly, reanalysis of a previous intravenous alcohol administration study confirmed the results of the oral alcohol challenge study. In summary, these results extend previous findings and provide new insights into the putative biobehavioral mechanisms that may moderate the association between the GABRA2 gene, sensitivity to the acute effects of alcohol and ultimately alcohol dependence.

Abstract = {Background: A 1977 study by Melzack et al. reported 100% anatomic and 71% clinical pain correspondences of myofascial trigger points and classical acupuncture points in the treatment of pain disorders. A reanalysis of this study's data using different acupuncture resources by Birch (2003) a quarter century later concluded that correlating trigger points to classical acupuncture points was not conceptually possible and that the only class of acupuncture points that could were the a shi points. Moreover, Birch concluded that no more than 40% of the acupuncture points examined by Melzack et al. correlated clinically for the treatment of pain (correlation was more like 18%-19%). Objective: To examine Birch's claims that myofascial trigger points cannot conceptually be compared to classical acupuncture points and that most (at least 60%) of the classical acupuncture points examined by the study of Melzack et al. are not recommended for treating pain conditions, negating their findings of a 71% clinical pain correspondence of trigger points and acupuncture points. Methods: Acupuncture references and literature were reviewed to examine the validity of the Birch study findings. Results: Acupuncture references support the conceptual comparison of trigger points to classical acupuncture points in the treatment of pain disorders, and their clinical correspondence in this regard is likely 95% or higher. Conclusions: Although separated by 2000 years temporally, the acupuncture and myofascial pain traditions have fundamental clinical similarities in the treatment of pain disorders. Myofascial pain data and research may help elucidate the mechanisms of acupuncture's effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Fikkert (1994) analyzed a large corpus of Dutch children's early language production, and found that they often add targetless syllables to their words in order to create bisyllabic feet. In this note we point out a methodological problem with that analysis: in an important number of cases, epenthetic vowels occur at places where grammatical morphemes (e.g. plural and diminutive suffixes) may be expected. Hence, the seemingly targetless syllables may represent grammatical morphemes. A reanalysis of Fikkert's original data reveals that her rhythmic explanation cannot be maintained if those cases are excluded from the analysis.

Abstract = {As part of the International Multi-centre ADHD Genetics project we completed an affected sibling pair study of 142 narrowly defined Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition combined type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) proband-sibling pairs. No linkage was observed on the most established ADHD-linked genomic regions of 5p and 17p. We found suggestive linkage signals on chromosomes 9 and 16, respectively, with the highest multipoint nonparametric linkage signal on chromosome 16q23 at 99 cM (log of the odds, LOD = 3.1) overlapping data published from the previous UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) (LOD > 1, ∼95 cM) and Dutch (LOD > 1, ∼100 cM) studies. The second highest peak in this study was on chromosome 9q22 at 90 cM (LOD = 2.13); both the previous UCLA and German studies also found some evidence of linkage at almost the same location (UCLA LOD = 1.45 at 93 cM; German LOD = 0.68 at 100 cM). The overlap of these two main peaks with previous findings suggests that loci linked to ADHD may lie within these regions. Meta-analysis or reanalysis of the raw data of all the available ADHD linkage scan data may help to clarify whether these represent true linked loci.

Abstract = {The item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) effect refers to the observation that the Stroop effect is larger for words that are presented mostly in congruent colors (e.g., BLUE presented 75% of the time in blue) and smaller for words that are presented mostly in a given incongruent color (e.g., YELLOW presented 75% of the time in orange). One account of the ISPC effect, the modulation hypothesis, is that participants modulate attention based on the identity of the word (i.e., participants allow the word to influence responding when it is presented mostly in its congruent color). Another account, the contingency hypothesis, is that participants use the word to predict the response that they will need to make (e.g., if the word is YELLOW, then the response is probably "orange"). Reanalyses of data from L. L. Jacoby, D. S. Lindsay, and S. Hessels (2003), along with results from new experiments, are inconsistent with the modulation hypothesis but entirely consistent with the contingency hypothesis. A response threshold mechanism that uses contingency information provides a sufficient account of the data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Our recent article pointing out numerical and typographical errors in a prior study about mercury and autism, and then reanalyzing the data properly, illustrated that mercury blood levels were related to autism diagnosis. This topic has generated strong responses and there seems to be some confusion about key aspects of the article. A case in point is the letter by Aschner in which the author appears to believe the blood mercury relationship to autism has some relation to the separate hair analysis. It does not, was clearly stated as such in the article, and is further elaborated upon here. It is argued that when one has strong opinions about a scientific issue, scientists should be certain that their biases are not preventing them from understanding and considering new evidence--even if it is contrary to their expectations.

The authors review some of the difficulties in causal inference from observational, longitudinal data; examine the extent to which these seem relevant to the empirical work on exposure to televised violence published to date; and present a reanalysis of data from an especially influential study to address one of the more serious limitations of existing analyses. They conclude that the data give evidence that there is likely, although not certainly, a causal connection between exposure to televised violence and adult aggression.

Abstract = {A central topic in sentence comprehension research is the kinds of information and mechanisms involved in resolving temporary ambiguity regarding the syntactic structure of a sentence. Gaze patterns in scenes during spoken sentence comprehension have provided strong evidence that visual scenes trigger rapid syntactic reanalysis. However, they have also been interpreted as reflecting nonlinguistic, visual processes. Furthermore, little is known as to whether similar processes of syntactic revision are triggered by linguistic versus scene cues. To better understand how scenes influence comprehension and its time course, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during the comprehension of spoken sentences that relate to depicted events. Prior electrophysiological research has observed a P600 when structural disambiguation toward a noncanonical structure occurred during reading and in the absence of scenes. We observed an ERP component with a similar latency, polarity, and distribution when depicted events disambiguated toward a noncanonical structure. The distributional similarities further suggest that scenes are on a par with linguistic contexts in triggering syntactic revision. Our findings confirm the interpretation of previous eye movement studies and highlight the benefits of combining ERP and eye-tracking measures to ascertain the neuronal processes enabled by, and the locus of attention in, visual contexts.

Abstract = {Rationale: Route-tracing stereotypy is a powerful behavioral correlate of striatal function that is difficult to quantify. Measurements of route-tracing stereotypy in an automated, high throughput, easily quantified, and replicable manner would facilitate functional studies of this central nervous system region. Objective: We examined how t-pattern sequential analysis (Magnusson Behav Res Meth Instrum Comput 32:93-110, 2000) can be used to quantify mouse route-tracing stereotypies. This method reveals patterns by testing whether particular sequences of defined states occur within a specific time interval at a probability greater than chance. Results: Mouse home-cage locomotor patterns were recorded after psychostimulant administration (GBR 12909, 0, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg; d-amphetamine, 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg). After treatment with GBR 12909, dose-dependent increases in the number of found patterns and overall pattern length and depth were observed. Similar findings were seen after treatment with d-amphetamine up to the dosage where focused stereotypies dominated behavioral response. For both psychostimulants, detected patterns displayed similar morphological features. Pattern sets containing a few frequently repeated patterns of greater length/depth accounted for a greater percentage of overall trial duration in a dose-dependant manner. This finding led to the development of a t-pattern-derived route-tracing stereotypy score. Compared to scores derived by manual observation, these t-pattern-derived route-tracing stereotypy scores yielded similar results with less within-group variability. These findings remained similar after reanalysis with removal of patterns unmatched after human scoring and after normalization of locomotor speeds at low and high ranges. Conclusions: T-pattern analysis is a versatile and robust pattern detection and quantification algorithm that complements currently available observational phenotyping methods.

Abstract = {The assumption that people possess a repertoire of strategies to solve the inference problems they face has been made repeatedly. The experimental findings of two previous studies on strategy selection are reexamined from a learning perspective, which argues that people learn to select strategies for making probabilistic inferences. This learning process is modeled with the strategy selection learning (SSL) theory, which assumes that people develop subjective expectancies for the strategies they have. They select strategies proportional to their expectancies, which are updated on the basis of experience. For the study by Newell, Weston, and Shanks (2003) it can be shown that people did not anticipate the success of a strategy from the beginning of the experiment. Instead, the behavior observed at the end of the experiment was the result of a learning process that can be described by the SSL theory. For the second study, by Bröder and Schiffer (2006), the SSL theory is able to provide an explanation for why participants only slowly adapted to new environments in a dynamic inference situation. The reanalysis of the previous studies illustrates the importance of learning for probabilistic inferences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We investigated the processing of sentences containing a quantifier scope ambiguity, such as Kelly showed a photo to each critic, which is ambiguous between the indefinite phrase (a photo) having one or many referents. Ambiguity resolution requires the computation of relative quantifier scope, with either a photo or each critic taking wide scope, thereby determining the number of referents. Using eye tracking, we established that multiple factors, including the grammatical function and surface linear order of quantified phrases, along with their lexical characteristics, interact during the processing of relative quantifier scope, with conflict between factors incurring a processing cost. We discuss the results in terms of theoretical accounts attributing sentence-processing difficulty to either reanalysis (e.g., Fodor, 1982) or competition between rival analyses (e.g., Kurtzman & MacDonald, 1993 (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose of review: The placebo literature has substantially increased in 2006 and 2007, and more and more medical and psychological subspecialties have added empirical data to our knowledge. Recent findings: The theoretical framework of our understanding of the placebo response needs extension to account for findings that cannot be attributed to (Pavlovian) conditioning or suggestions alone. In addition, imaging studies need to address individual responses rather than group means, and to expand beyond experimental pain research. Gender aspects have been demonstrated for the placebo response but still widely ignored, especially in neurophysiological studies. It has been shown that nocebo research needs a methodological and ethical framework that allows its exploration. Finally, analyses of clinical trial data, either as metaanalyses or as reanalyses of trial raw data, may allow us to identify factors that subsequently can be used in experimental work. Summary: Novel findings will allow better planning of clinical drug trials, better handling of clinical trial data in the future, and finally, may eventually result in improved patient management.

Mitroff (Personality and Individual Differences, 2012[Feb], Vol 52[3], 422-427). In the original article, a coding error in the NEO personality measure was discovered. A reanalysis of the affected models found only slight differences that do not substantially change the interpretation of regression model results. However, there were several minor ramifications. The correctly coded model resulted in stronger overall fits for both the Personality Model [Old R2 change = 2.975, p = 0.008; New R2 change = 8.259, p < 0.001] and the Cumulative Model, [Old: R2 = 0.306; New: R2 = 0.346] and also changed the contribution of the underlying subscales slightly. Whereas the Openness factor of the NEO had previously not significantly predicted spectating, in the correctly coded data this relationship became significant (β = −0.171, p = 0.005). In addition, the previously reported positive correlation between spectating and the Extroversion 'gregariousness' facet (β = 0.039, p = 0.048) no longer reach criterion significance (β= 0.112, p = 0.153). (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-27722-001[/rid]). Despite the prominence of sports in contemporary society, little is known about the identity and personality traits of sports spectators. With a sample of 293 individuals, we examine four broad categories of factors that may explain variability in the reported amount of time spent watching sports. Using individual difference regression techniques, we explore the relationship between sports spectating and physiological measures (e.g., testosterone and cortisol), clinical self-report scales (ADHD and autism), personality traits (e.g., NEO “Big Five”), and pastime activities (e.g., video game playing). Our results indicate that individuals who report higher levels of sports spectating tend to have higher levels of extraversion, and in particular excitement seeking and gregariousness. These individuals also engage more in complementary pastime activities, including participating in sports and exercise activities, watching TV/movies, and playing video games. Notably, no differences were observed in the clinical self-report scales, indicating no differences in reported symptoms of ADHD or autism for spectators and non-spectators. Likewise, no relationship was seen between baseline concentrations of testosterone or cortisol and sports spectating in our sample. These results provide an assessment of the descriptive personality dimensions of frequent sports spectators and provide a basic taxonomy of how these traits are expressed across the population.

Abstract = {This article questions the link between antidepressant drugs use and suicide in children. A recent reanalysis of randomized placebo-controlled studies of two antidepressants has reopened the debate on the use of the drugs in children and adolescents. New research suggesting that antidepressants do not increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents is raising questions over the black box warnings placed on the drugs’ packaging. Scientists in Chicago failed to find evidence that fluoxetine, marketed as prozac or sarafem, increased the risk for suicide in youths. In adults, fluoxetine and venlafaxine, sold as effexor, was found to decrease suicidal thoughts and behavior as well as depressive symptoms. Relative to placebo, fluoxetine seemed to have no effect either way on suicidal thoughts and behavior in children but it leads to a lowering in the severity of depressive symptoms. In adult and geriatric patients taking antidepressants, there is a significant reduction in depression and suicide risk over time compared with patients taking placebo. There is a need of further studies on why there seems to be a disassociation between depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior in children.

The authors reconstructed 59 data sets from published studies in which response bias had been manipulated experimentally. These data were fit with signal detection theory (SDT) and a two high-threshold model (2HTM). However, the G2 statistic for SDT fits was misspecified, and there were some errors in the reconstructed frequencies. These errors are corrected in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-05251-001[/rid].) Recent reviews of recognition receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) claim that their curvilinear shape rules out threshold models of recognition. However, the shape of ROCs based on confidence ratings is not diagnostic to refute threshold models, whereas ROCs based on experimental bias manipulations are. Also, fitting predicted frequencies to actual data is a more sensitive method for model comparisons than ROC regressions. In a reanalysis of 59 published data sets, the 2-high-threshold model (2HTM) fit the data better than an unequal variance signal detection model in about half of the cases. Three recognition experiments with experimental bias manipulation were conducted that yielded linear ROCs and a better fit of the 2HTM in all cases. On the basis of actual data and a simulation, the authors argue that both models are at least equally valid as measurement tools and can perhaps be integrated theoretically.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Ian Hickie and Naomi Rogers (see record [rid]2011-18154-035[/rid]). The authors, in their review of the pharmacology and clinical profile of novel melatonin based therapies, report that agomelatine has clinically significant antidepressant properties. However, this claim is not based on a systematic review of available evidence nor supported by the efficacy data that Hickie and Rogers themselves present. A reanalysis of the efficacy of agomelatine versus placebo, by application of standard Cochrane methods to the data reported, reveals that acute treatment with agomelatine 50 mg is associated with a difference over placebo of 1.5 points on the Hamilton scale. We argue that any reporting of clinical trial data, even in review articles that are focused on new biological mechanisms, should follow the same standard of reporting that is required from authors of systematic reviews.

Gilbert et al. performed a reanalysis of our data and observed that CPR duration predicted short-term outcome with a similar accuracy to early EEG features in children treated with hypothermia after cardiac arrest. The objective of our investigation was to address the clinical feasibility of conducting continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) in this setting and describe the occurrence of seizures in this population. Our goal was not to use brief EEG samples as early prognostic indicators. The recent AAN Practice Parameter addressing outcome prediction in comatose adults after cardiac arrest concludes that prognosis should not be based on the characteristics of CPR (including duration) and this recommendation may reasonably be extended to children. We believe EEG features may be prognostically relevant for 4 reasons which are further elucidated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The risk of suicide, which causes about 1 million deaths each year, is considered to augment as the levels of stress increases. Dysregulation in the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, involving the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its main receptor (CRHR1), is associated with depression, frequent among suicidal males. Here we have analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes, in family trios with suicide attempter offspring (n = 542), by using the transmission disequilibrium test both in a two-staged screening/replication sample design and in detailed reanalysis in the entire sample. Stratification based on the levels of lifetime stress showed reproducible association and linkage of an SNP in the CRHR1 gene (rs4792887) to suicide attempters exposed to low levels of stress (P = 0.002), among whom most males were depressed (P = 0.001). The identified allele may represent a part of the genetic susceptibility for suicidality by increasing HPA axis activity upon exposure to low levels of stress.

Abstract = {The study investigated whether the P600/SPS component is sensitive to the richness of semantic content in sentences. ERPs were recorded while 30 native Swedish speakers read sentences, of which half were syntactically correct and half contained a syntactic violation. Both kinds of sentences came in one of three types of descending semantic completeness: semantically coherent sentences, sentences which were incoherent due to violations of selectional restrictions, or sentences of pseudo words, hence void of lexical content. In the semantically coherent sentences a P600/SPS was found for the syntactic violation. A less salient positivity was found for the violation in the semantically incoherent sentences. No P600/SPS was found for the syntactic violation in the pseudo word sentences and no LAN component in any sentence type. The results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that the P600/SPS component reflects a semantically based reanalysis process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The term "construction" is not a label to be assigned randomly, but presupposes a structural analysis with an associated set of syntactic and semantic properties. Based on this premise, the term "serial verb construction" (SVC) as currently used in Chinese linguistics will be shown to simply refer to any multiverb surface string i.e., to subsume different constructions. The synchronic consequence of this situation is that SVCs in Chinese linguistics are not commensurate with SVCs in, e.g., Niger-Congo languages, whence the futility at this stage to search for a "serialization parameter" deriving the differences between so-called "serializing" and "non-serializing" languages. On the diachronic side, SVCs are invoked as a privileged site for verb-to-preposition reanalysis, but it is left open what structure is referred to under this label. A precise structural analysis of both the input and the output structure is, however, indispensable in order to make meaningful statements about language change.

Abstract = {Rudner et al (2008) showed that when compression release settings are manipulated in the hearing instruments of Swedish habitual users, the resulting mismatch between the phonological form of the input speech signal and representations stored in long-term memory leads to greater engagement of explicit cognitive processing under taxing listening conditions. The mismatch effect is manifest in significant correlations between performance on cognitive tests and aided-speech-recognition performance in modulated noise and/or with fast compression release settings. This effect is predicted by the ELU model (Rönnberg et al, 2008). In order to test whether the mismatch effect can be generalized across languages, we examined two sets of aided speech recognition data collected from a Danish population where two cognitive tests, reading span and letter monitoring, had been administered. A reanalysis of all three datasets, including 102 participants, demonstrated the mismatch effect. These findings suggest that the effect of phonological mismatch, as predicted by the ELU model (Rönnberg et al, this issue) and tapped by the reading span test, is a stable phenomenon across these two Scandinavian languages.

Abstract = {The aim of the study was a reanalysis of data on stress perception and coping in adolescence and the impact of a chronic disease (n = 91 adolescents with diabetes mellitus vs. n = 107 healthy control subjects). Based on a four wave longitudinal design, latent growth curve modeling was used to clarify the role of diabetes, e. g., whether it has a moderating or a mediating effect. Furthermore, the impact of gender and age at first wave of measurement (M = 13.9, SD = 1.35) was analyzed. For adolescents with diabetes, metabolic control was also used as a predictor of initial level and later growth of stress and coping. The results showed a small overall decrease in stress over time and substantial increases in active and internal coping, although less so in adolescents with diabetes. Further, adolescents with diabetes with good metabolic control showed the most noticeable decrease in stress and increase in functional coping styles over time, pointing to the medical and psychological importance of good metabolic control.

Abstract = {The recognition heuristic is hypothesized to be a frugal inference strategy assuming that inferences are based on the recognition cue alone. This assumption, however, has been questioned by existing research. At the same time most studies rely on the proportion of choices consistent with the heuristic as a measure of its use which may not be fully appropriate. In this study, we propose an index to identify true users of the heuristic contrasting them to decision makers who incorporate further knowledge beyond recognition. The properties and the applicability of the proposed index are investigated in the reanalyses of four published experiments and corroborated by a new study drawn up to rectify the shortcomings of the reanalyzed experiments. Applying the proposed index to explore the influence of knowledge we found that participants who were more knowledgeable made use of the information available to them and achieved the highest proportion of correct inferences.

Abstract = {Objectives: (1) To review the available studies on training of non-mental healthcare providers in mental health in low- and middle-income countries. (2) To assess the combined effect of training in knowledge and skills of the participants through meta-analysis. Methods: A literature search yielded 10 studies that matched the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was carried out to assess the change (pre-post) in knowledge and diagnostic ability of the participants. Results: Very few studies are available in this area and their methodologies are not robust. Participants are mostly general physicians or nurses and other health workers or a combination of these. Content and schedule of training was variable across studies. Analysis of pooled data based on a fixed-effect model demonstrated a significant improvement in participants' knowledge. However, there was significant heterogeneity among studies assessing diagnostic skills of the participants. A reanalysis utilizing the random-effect model demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of the participants but no significant change in diagnostic specificity. Number needed to train analysis showed that training made one in three participants-significantly better with regard to their knowledge and ability (sensitivity) to diagnose mental illness. However, training had a very limited effect on improvement of specificity of diagnosis. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest that paraprofessional training in mental health may yield effective outcomes despite the occurrence of wide variation in training packages. However, training courses should pay more attention to improving the specificity of diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Syntactically ambiguous sentences are sometimes read faster than disambiguated strings. Models of parsing have explained this tendency by appealing either to a race in the construction of alternative structures or to reanalysis. However, it is also possible that readers of ambiguous sentences save time by strategically underspecifying interpretations of ambiguous attachments. In a self-paced reading study, participants viewed sentences with relative clauses that could attach to one of two sites. Type of question was also manipulated between participants in order to test whether goals can influence reading/parsing strategies. The experiment revealed an ambiguity advantage in reading times, but only when participants expected superficial comprehension questions. When participants expected queries about relative clause interpretation, disambiguating regions were inspected with more care, and the ambiguity advantage was attenuated. However, even when participants expected relative clause queries, question-answering times suggested underspecified representations of ambiguous relative clause attachments. The results support the construal and "good-enough" models of parsing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The reanalysis of the data, using HLM methodology, was designed to partition individual differences from aggregate group variance, as well as to test a number of focused hypotheses regarding the effects of gender and gender-ratio in class on self-concept. With respect to self-concept, the BFLPE hypothesizes that it is better to be a good student in an average-ability reference group than to be a good student in a high-ability reference group. Prior studies explored the BFLPE comparing gifted students in different educational contexts. Here, the BFLPE was exclusively investigated within special gifted classes. Results supported the BFLPE for academic self-concept. Furthermore, whereas girls' academic self-concept was negatively influenced by gender-ratio (percentage of boys in class), gender-ratio had no significant influence on boys' academic self-concept.

Abstract = {Background: The pathology causing progressive aphasia is typically a variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, especially with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Less commonly the underlying pathology is Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: To compare clinicopathologic and MRI features of subjects with progressive aphasia and AD pathology to subjects with aphasia and FTLD-U pathology and subjects with typical AD. Methods: We identified 5 subjects with aphasia and AD pathology and 5 with aphasia and FTLD-U pathology with an MRI from a total of 216 aphasia subjects. Ten subjects with typical AD clinical features and AD pathology were also identified. All subjects with AD pathology underwent pathologic reanalysis with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess patterns of gray matter atrophy in the aphasia cases with AD pathology, aphasia cases with FTLD-U, and typical AD cases with AD pathology, compared with a normal control group. Results: All aphasic subjects had fluent speech output. However, those with AD pathology had better processing speed than those with FTLD-U pathology. Immunohistochemistry with TDP-43 antibodies was negative. VBM revealed gray matter atrophy predominantly in the temporoparietal cortices, with notable sparing of the hippocampus in the aphasia with AD subjects. In comparison, the aphasic subjects with FTLD-U showed sparing of the parietal lobe. Typical AD subjects showed temporoparietal and hippocampal atrophy. Conclusions: A temporoparietal pattern of atrophy on MRI in patients with progressive fluent aphasia and relatively preserved processing speed is suggestive of underlying Alzheimer disease pathology rather than frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only immunoreactive changes.

Abstract = {E. Brandstätter, G. Gigerenzer, and R. Hertwig (2006; see record [rid]2006-04733-008[/rid]) contended that their priority heuristic, a type of lexicographic semiorder model, is more accurate than cumulative prospect theory (CPT) or transfer of attention exchange (TAX) models in describing risky decisions. However, there are 4 problems with their argument. First, their heuristic is not descriptive of certain data that they did not review. Second, their analysis relied on a global index of fit, percentage of correct predictions of the modal choice. Such analyses can lead to wrong conclusions when parameters are not properly estimated from the data. When parameters are estimated from the data, CPT and TAX fit the D. Kahneman and A. Tversky (1979) data perfectly. Reanalysis shows that TAX and CPT do as well as the priority heuristic for 2 of the data sets reviewed and outperform the priority heuristic for the other 3. Third, when 2 of these sets of data are reexamined, the priority heuristic is seen to make systematic violations. Fourth, new critical implications have been devised for testing the family of lexicographic semiorders including the priority heuristic; new results with these critical tests show systematic evidence against lexicographic semiorder models.

Also, contrary to much public and medical opinion, treatment of depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors does not increase but rather may decrease youth suicide fatalities. A recent reanalysis by the US Food and Drug Administration of existing data from clinical trials across the lifespan suggest an age-dependent effect on nonfatal suicide attempts and suicidal ideation, in which risk appears to be increased in youth and reduced from mid-adulthood and onward. Summary: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a modestly effective and generally safe treatment for postpubertal major depressive disorder, but their use requires collaborative decision making and a predetermined, shared monitoring plan.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by L. Lecardeur et al. (see record [rid]2009-01129-030[/rid]). The authors explored the relationships between cognitive complaints assessed by the Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia. The authors suggested that patients with schizophrenia might be conscious of their cognitive deficits in spite of a lack of insight concerning their psychotic symptoms. Consequently, in light of our reanalysis we argue that cognitive complaints, cognitive impairments and insight in schizophrenia are three relatively independent phenomenon in schizophrenia. Furthermore, in respect to the two studies discussed here we propose that it would be challenging to explore in a future study the relationships between insight into clinical symptoms and insight into cognitive impairment with objective neuropsychological testing.

J. Fitzsimons (see record [rid]2011-26781-002[/rid]). In a commentary in the previous issue of Social Influence, Schneider, Tahk, and Krosnick raise concerns about the analytical techniques and conclusions drawn in Williams, Block, and Fitzsimons (2006). In this response, we address a number of issues raised by their comment. We discuss their thorough reanalysis of our data, what we believe it implies, and what conclusions should be drawn. We also briefly present a number of replications of the Williams et al. experiment and discuss what the collective implications of this work are. Ultimately, we conclude that the original warning cast by Williams et al. still stands: when we ask questions about vice behaviors we should do so with great care as we may unintentionally be increasing the behavior we are asking about.

Abstract = {Previous research from our laboratory demonstrated that administration of single doses (120, 240, 360 mg) of standardised Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) had linear, dose-dependent, positive effects on the speed of performing attention tasks in comparison to placebo. However, whilst the lowest dose, which is typical of a recommended daily dose, had no effect on the speed of attention task performance it did engender mild improvements in secondary memory performance. The current study presents a reanalysis of data from three methodologically identical studies that each included a treatment of 120 mg GBE and matched placebo. All three studies were of a multiple dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind, balanced-crossover design, employing four or five treatment arms in total. Across the studies 78 healthy young participants received 120 mg GBE and placebo in randomly counterbalanced order, separated by a wash-out period of at least 7 days. On each study day participants' performance on the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerised cognitive assessment battery was measured immediately prior to dosing and at 1, 2.5, 4 and 6 hr following treatment, with scores collapsed into the six measures (speed of attention, accuracy of attention, secondary memory, working memory, speed of memory, quality of memory) which have previously been derived by factor analysis of the data from CDR subtests. The results showed that 120 mg of Ginkgo engendered a significant improvement on the quality of memory factor that was most evident at 1 and 4 hr post-dose, but had a negative effect on performance on the speed of attention factor that was most evident at 1 and 6 hr post-dose. The current study confirmed the previous observation of modestly improved memory performance following 120 mg of GBE, but suggests that acute administration of this typical daily dose may have a detrimental effect on the speed of attention task performance which is opposite to that seen previously following higher doses.

Abstract = {Objective: To demonstrate the value of comparing data from multiple cohort studies using the example of self-rated health (SRH). Methods: Seven Australian cohort studies including comparable data on SRH were identified. Comparisons of the distributions of SRH were conducted, and logistic regression was used to evaluate age, sex and education effects within studies. A nationally representative survey was used as a statistical reference to determine how studies differed from the Australian population in frequencies of responses. Results: Ratings of SRH declined with increasing age. Low education was associated with higher frequencies of fair/poor SRH even in young adulthood but there were no sex differences. Results for smaller studies did not necessarily differ from nationally representative studies. Conclusion: Collaborative reanalysis of Australian cohort permits analysis of health outcomes from a large numbers of participants. Health outcomes and their sociodemographic determinants may be more comprehensively evaluated through such collaborative projects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The influence of orthography on children's on-line auditory word recognition was studied from the end of Grade 2 to the end of Grade 4, by examining the orthographic consistency effect [Ziegler, J. C., & Ferrand, L. (1998). Orthography shapes the perception of speech: The consistency effect in auditory recognition. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 5, 683-689.] in auditory lexical decision and shadowing tasks. Words with rimes that can be spelled in two different ways (inconsistent) produced longer auditory lexical decision and shadowing times and more errors than did consistent words. A similar consistency effect was also observed on pseudowords. The observation of a general consistency effect, both for words and pseudowords, in lexical decision and in shadowing suggests a widespread influence of orthography in the children's spoken word recognition system. On exactly the same material, with adult listeners we replicated the usual pattern of an orthographic consistency effect restricted to words in lexical decision [Ventura, P., Morais, J., Pattamadilok, C., & Kolinsky, R. (2004). The locus of the orthographic consistency effect in auditory word recognition. Language and Cognitive Processes, 19, 57-95; Ziegler, J. C., & Ferrand, L. (1998).

The locus of the orthographic consistency effect in auditory word recognition. Language and Cognitive Processes, 19, 57-95.] confirmed the discrepancy between the effects of orthographic consistency in child readers and adults. A further control experiment showed that orthographic consistency effects were not present in pre-readers. Results are interpreted considering the coexistence in children's reading of a mechanism of automatic access to well-specified orthographic representations of words and the persistence of grapho-phonological decoding procedures.

Abstract = {Purpose: Learning and behavioral difficulties often occur in benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS). In recent years, several electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics have been related to the occurrence of learning and behavioral problems. Methods: From 28 children medical, school and psychological reports were present and children were rated according to a 4-point scale for educational and behavioral impairment (Part 1). Thirty 24-h EEG recordings were reanalyzed for spike frequency, the presence of atypical EEG criteria, and the presence of a nondipole spike. EEGs were scored during wakefulness, first hour of sleep and whole night sleep (minus the first hour of sleep) separately (Part 2). Results: The presence of I: an intermittent slow-wave focus during wakefulness, II: a high number of spikes in the first hour of sleep (and during whole night sleep), and III: multiple asynchronous bilateral spike-wave foci in the first hour of sleep correlates significantly with a sum score ≥ 3 which indicates a complicated course with educational or behavioral impairment. It is sufficient to analyze an EEG during wakefulness and a sleep EEG for only the first hour of sleep instead of a whole night recording to demonstrate those EEG criteria. Conclusions: On basis of our reanalysis we can possibly conclude that the aforementioned EEG characteristics correlate with educational impairments, and that analysing an EEG recording during wake and the first hour of sleep is sufficient to look adequately for those EEG criteria in children with BCECTS.

Abstract = {Recent studies have found negative correlations between mystery and preference for forest settings. Our reanalysis of earlier data suggested that those findings may have stemmed from a failure to examine setting categories within the forest domain. In the current study of 70 within-forest settings, factor analysis of preference ratings revealed two setting categories corresponding to high- and low-visual-access settings. In the high-access category, preference was positively correlated with mystery but uncorrelated with visual access. In the low-access category, preference was uncorrelated with mystery but positively correlated with visual access. We also examined an expanded definition of mystery that made explicit the distinction between mystery and surprise. The expanded definition produced results identical to the standard definition in the high-access category, but in the low-access category, expanded mystery was positively correlated with preference. We conclude that when properly understood, mystery tends to be positively related to preference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {When probabilistic inferences have to be made from cue values stored in long-term memory, many participants appear to use fast and frugal heuristics, such as "take the best" (TTB), that assume sequential search of cues. A simultaneous global matching process with cue weights that are appropriately chosen would mimic the decision outcomes, albeit assuming different cognitive processes. We present a reanalysis of response times (RTs) from five published experiments (n = 415) and one new experiment (n = 82) that support the assumption of sequential search. In all instances in which decision outcomes indicated the use of TTB's decision rule, decision times increased monotonically with the number of cues that had to be searched in memory. Furthermore, RT patterns fitted the outcome-based strategy classifications, which further validates both measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

They conclude that the lower prevalence in MZ twins might invalidate conclusions from classic twin models. I critique the conducted meta-analysis and suggest additional analyses to be conducted. A reanalysis of the Finnish Twin Cohort 1975 questionnaire data (included in Tisher and Carey) indicates that when intrapair correlations are correctly taken into account, the MZ-DZ difference in that study is no longer statistically significant. Even if the Tisher/Carey finding holds up in further analyses, it pertains only to the observed trait, the effect is small in size, and the mechanism underlying it needs to be explored.

Abstract = {In their article on the sustainability of educational upward mobility, Fuchs and Sixt (see record [rid]2007-15793-007[/rid]) investigate both the structure and the mechanisms of social inheritance of educational success across three generations. In theoretical respect the authors assume that children of educational climbers might have less educational chances than children of parents and grandparents with a long academic tradition. Utilizing data of the German Socio-Economic Panel as well as applying binary logistic regression they confirm their hypothesis calling the sustainability of educational expansion in question. In the present reanalysis data of the German Life History Study on educational histories of several generations are analysed by multinomial logistic regression. It can be demonstrated that the results by Fuchs and Sixt seems to be a statistical artefact because of multicollinearity. Additionally there are significant indications that educationally upward mobile parents are able to transfer their educational success to their children provided that these parents ate also able to realize upward mobility in the status hierarchy or in the class structure. These both mechanisms of social mobility are essential for both the self-dynamic and the sustainability of the educational expansion in West Germany.

Abstract = {Predicting the outcome of antidepressant treatment by pre-treatment features would be of great usefulness for clinicians as up to 50% of major depressives may not have a satisfactory response in spite of adequate trials of antidepressant drugs. In the present article we compared a linear multivariate model of predictors with a few artificial neural network (ANN) models differing from one another by outcome definition and validation procedure. The sample consisted of a reanalysis of 116 inpatients with a major depressive episode included in a 6-week open-label trial with fluvoxamine. With the original outcome definition (responders/non-responders), ANN performed better than logistic regression (90% of correct classifications in the training sample vs. 77%). However only 62% of new patients were correctly predicted by ANN for their outcome class. Length of the index episode, psychotic features and suicidal behavior emerged as outcome predictors in both models, while demographic characteristics, personality disorders and concomitant somatic morbidity were pointed to only by ANN analysis. Increase of classes in the outcome field resulted in a more elevated error: 46.4% for three classes, 60.4% for four classes and 70.3% for five classes. Overall, our findings suggest that antidepressant outcome prediction based on clinical variables is poor. The ANN approach is as valid as traditional multivariate techniques for the analysis of psychopharmacology studies. The complex interactions modelled through ANN may eventually be applied at the clinical level for individualized therapy. However, the accuracy of prediction is still far from satisfactory from a clinical point of view. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Forensic psychologists have approached sexually violent predator (SVP) civil commitment evaluations from the position that respondents must be positive for a condition from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association to be classified as SVPs. The only research on DSM diagnostic reliability in SVP cases has been undertaken by J. S. Levenson (2004a) and R. L. Packard and J. Levenson (2006). Although Packard and Levenson claimed that diagnostic evaluations in SVP cases were highly reliable, a reanalysis of their data indicated otherwise. Further, high levels of diagnostic uncertainty were found for a proposed paraphilia referred to as paraphilia not otherwise specified-nonconsent. Diagnostic criteria used to identify paraphilias among SVP respondents are therefore characterized by poor reliability. Logic models that were previously used to determine diagnostic confidence are also obsolete. Recommendations for improving diagnostic reliability are discussed, and the Null-Bayes Logic Model (NBLM) is proposed as a method for reaching certainty opinions that is superior to past models based on unrestrained clinical judgment. The implications of the present results and the NBLM for future practice, research, and policy directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Context: Many studies try to probe for differences in risks between men and women, and this is a major challenge in the expanding literature of associations between genetic variants and common diseases or traits. Objective: To evaluate whether prominently claimed sex differences for genetic effects have sufficient internal and external validity. Data Sources: We searched PubMed through July 6, 2007, for genetic association studies claiming sex-related differences in the articles' titles. Titles and abstracts and, if necessary, the full text of the article were assessed for eligibility. Study Selection: Two hundred fifteen articles were retrieved by the search. We considered eligible all retrieved association studies that claimed different genetic effects across sexes of 1 or more gene variants for any human disease or phenotype. We considered both biallelic and multiallelic markers (including haplotypes) and both binary and continuous phenotypes and traits. We excluded non-English-language studies; studies evaluating only 1 sex; studies in which sex was treated only as an independent predictor of disease; studies that did not address any association of the investigated genetic variant with a disease or trait; studies not involving humans; and studies in which the authors did not claim any sex difference. Data Extraction: Two evaluators independently extracted data with a third evaluator arbitrating their discrepancies. Data evaluation included whether analyses were stated to have been specified a priori; whether sex effects were evaluated in the whole study or subgroups thereof; and whether the claims were appropriately documented, insufficiently documented, or spurious. For appropriately and insufficiently documented claims we performed the calculations for gene-sex interaction whenever raw data were available. Finally, we compared the sex-difference claims with the best internal validity against the results of other studies addressing the same interaction. Results: We appraised 432 sex-difference claims in 77 eligible articles. Authors stated that sex comparisons were decided a priori for 286 claims (66.2%), while the entire sample size was used in 210 (48.6%) claims. Appropriate documentation of gene-sex interaction was recorded in 55 claims (12.7%); documentation was insufficient for 303 claims and spurious for the other 74. Data for reanalysis of claims were available for 188 comparisons. Of these, 83 (44.1%) were nominally statistically significant at a P = .05 threshold, and more than half of them (n = 44) had modest P values between .01 and .05. Of 60 claims with seemingly the best internal validity, only 1 was consistently replicated in at least 2 other studies. Conclusion: In this sample of highly prominent claims of sex-related differences in genetic associations, most claims were insufficiently documented or spurious, and claims with documented good internal and external validity were uncommon.

Abstract = {K. Rayner, A. Pollatsek, D. Drieghe, T. J. Slattery, and E. D. Reichle (see record [rid]2007-11669-010[/rid]) argued that the R. Kliegl, A. Nuthmann, and R. Engbert (see record [rid]2006-01956-002[/rid]) corpus-analytic evidence for distributed processing during reading should not be accepted because (a) there might be problems of multicollinearity, (b) the distinction between content and function words and the skipping status of neighboring words was ignored, and (c) there are inconsistencies with experimental results. Reanalyses with linear mixed-effect models demonstrate that (a) regression coefficients are stable across 9 samples, (b) lexical status and skipping status (and their interactions) are highly significant but do not account for the effects of word frequency for content and for function words, and (c) there is strong evidence for lexical processing of content words while fixating function words to the left of them. A critical result about fixation durations prior to skipped words is replicated in an experiment. The distinction between correlational analyses and well-controlled experiments and questions about generalizability of results are discussed. The author argues for a complementary role of corpus analysis, computational modeling, and experiments in reading research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {For diagnosis of patients with comorbid psychotic symptoms and substance use disorders (SUDs), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, makes clear distinctions between independent psychotic disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) and substance-induced syndromes (e.g., delirium, dementias). Most substance-induced psychotic symptoms are considered to be short lived and to resolve with sustained abstinence along with other symptoms of substance intoxication and withdrawal. These guidelines are challenged by practical difficulties in distinguishing between substance-induced and independent psychoses and by mounting evidence that marijuana use may be a contributing cause of schizophrenia. To inform the diagnostic distinction between substance-induced vs independent psychotic symptoms, 2 kinds of information could be sought from longitudinal research: (a) identification of early markers that clearly differentiate the 2 conditions and (b) more precise information about duration of psychotic symptoms induced by different substances. Evidence of this type could emerge from reanalysis of existing data from large-scale longitudinal studies of community samples. To inform possible nosological changes related to the possible schizophrenia-inducing role of marijuana (e.g., designating a "cannabis-induced" subtype), a wide range of research evidence will be needed to clarify the relationship between effects of cannabis and schizophrenia symptoms. Ultimately, the ideal psychiatric nomenclature will define syndromes on the basis of established etiology and/or pathophysiology. Given the strong association between SUDs and psychotic disorders, research on the neurobiology of psychotic disorders could fruitfully include subjects with comorbid SUDs to shed light on shared etiology and pathophysiology.

Abstract = {Freud's "Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy" (1909) has stimulated interminable "reanalysis." The case of Little Hans, an unprecedented experimental child analytic treatment, is reexamined in the light of newer theory and newly derestricted documents. The understanding of the complex overdetermination of Hans's phobia was not possible in the heroic age of psychoanalysis. Current analytic thought, as well as distance de-idealization vis-à-vis the pioneering past, has potentiated a reformation of the case. The severe disturbance of his mother had an adverse impact on Little Hans and his family. Her abuse of Hans's infant sister has been overlooked by generations of analysts. Trauma, child abuse, parental strife, and the preoedipal mother-child relationship emerge as important issues that intensified Hans's pathogenic oedipal conflicts and trauma. With limited, yet remarkable help from his father and Freud, Little Hans nevertheless had the ego strength and resilience to resolve his phobia, resume progressive development, and forge a successful creative career.

Abstract = {Qualitative researchers in human resource development (HRD) frequently use in-depth interviews as a research method. Yet reports from qualitative studies in HRD commonly pay little or no analytical attention to the co-construction of interview data. That is, reports of qualitative research projects often treat interviews as a transparent method of data collection, with the contents of answers to interview questions as data that mirror people's views and experiences of a "world out there." In this article, we demonstrate how an ethnomethodological approach to the reanalysis of interview data drawn from a qualitative study in HRD treats the research interview as a socially situated setting in which narrative data are co-constructed by speakers. From this perspective, it is possible to see how speakers produce unstable category descriptions and morally laden portrayals in order to support their claims. We argue that this type of analysis is useful for three reasons: (1) it provides a way to investigate instances in which interview accounts may prove analytically problematic; (2) it makes evident how interview data are produced by illuminating the conversational resources used by both researcher and participant to co-construct descriptions; and (3) it provides a new analytical approach for HRD researchers, who have until now relied primarily on thematic representations of findings derived from inductive analyses of interview data. By using this approach to analyze or reanalyze interview data, researchers may gain further insight into the research topic and the interaction that produced the interview data in a particular socially situated setting. This approach reveals the practical reasoning, identities, and moral assumptions demonstrated in talk by speakers. Such analysis, we argue, assists in HRD theory building in that it contributes to complex interpretations of data that respond to new and different questions, including methodological questions.

Abstract = {Background: The burden of neurological impairment (NI) in children living in resource-poor countries (RPCs) is unknown. This lack of data is caused by inappropriate case detection techniques. In RPCs, the most appropriate method should be inexpensive, simple, rapid and accurate. This article reviews methods used to identify children with NI and disability in RPCs, evaluating their effectiveness and suitability. Methods: A search of relevant articles was performed using the National Library of Medicine via PubMed and Medline search engines. In addition, bibliographies of reviews were also browsed to identify additional articles, particularly those from World Health Organization and United Nations sources and from government and unpublished reports. Key phrases used included impairment, disability or handicap and the following terms: identification, screening, prevalence and developing countries. Studies included were those that fulfilled the following criteria; performed in RPCs, presented data in detail to allow reanalysis and provided data on cost and validity of the methods. Results: Use of the national census, key informants and methods using rapid rural appraisal have low sensitivity and are not able to provide adequate information on diagnostic categories or risk factors. House-to-house surveys using questionnaires have high sensitivities (63-100%) in the detection of impairment, but this approach remains relatively expensive and cannot be applied to an entire population (e.g. a region or country) and is thus less useful for assessing the needs of disability. Furthermore, the sensitivity is decreased in the detection of some domains, e.g. cognition. Conclusions: Most of the approaches used for identifying individuals with NI or disability suffer from inadequacies, the main ones being low sensitivity and underreporting. To assess the burden, nationwide censuses combined with surveys in selected areas of the country may be useful. These systems, however, require validation to establish their suitability.

Abstract = {This essay focuses mainly on the topic of repetition (agieren)--on its metapsychological, clinical, and technical conceptions. It contains a core problem, that is, the question of the represented, the nonrepresented, and the unrepresentable in the psyche. This problem, in turn, brings to light the dialectical relation between drive and object and its specific articulation with the traumatic. The author attributes special significance to its clinical expression as 'destiny.' He points out a shift in the theory of the cure from recollection and the unveiling of unconscious desire, to the possibility of understanding 'pure' repetition, which would constitute the very essence of the drive. The author highlights three types of repetition, namely, 'representative' (oedipal) repetition, the repetition of the 'nonrepresented' (narcissistic), which may gain representation, and that of the 'unrepresentable' (sensory impressions, 'lived experiences from primal times,' 'prelinguistic signifiers,' 'ungovernable mnemic traces'). The concept--the metaphor--drive embryo brings the author close to the question of the archaic in psychoanalysis, where the repetition in the act would express itself. 'Another unconscious' would zealously conceal the entombed (verschüttet) that we are not yet able to describe-the 'innermost' rather than the 'buried' (untergegangen) or the 'annihilated' (zugrunde gegangen)--through a mechanism whose way of expression is repetition in the act. With 'Constructions in analysis' as its starting point, this paper suggests a different technical implementation from that of the Freudian construction; its main material is what emerges in the present of the transference as the repetition of 'something' lacking as history. The memory of the analytic process offers a historical diachrony whereby a temporality freed from repetition and utterly unique might unfold in the analysis. This diachrony would no longer be the historical reconstruction of material truth, but the construction of something new. The author briefly introduces some aspects of his conception of the psyche and of therapeutic work in terms of what he has designated as psychic zones. These zones are associated with various modes of becoming unconscious, and they coexist with different degrees of prevalence according to the psychopathology. Yet each of them will emerge with unique features in different moments of every analysis, determining both the analyst's positions and the very conditions of the analytic field. The zone of the death drive and of repetition is at the center of this essay. 'Pure' repetition expresses a time halted by the constant reiteration of an atemporal present. In this case, the 'royal road' for the expression of 'that' unconscious will be the act. The analyst's presence and his own drive wager will be pivotal to provide a last attempt at binding that will allow the creation of the lost 'psychic fabric 'and the construction, in a conjectural way, of some sort of 'history' that may unravel the entombed (verschüttet) elements that, in these patients' case, come to the surface in the act. The analysand's 'pure' repetition touches, resonates with something of the new unconscious of the analyst. All of this leads the author to underline once again the value of the analyst's self-analysis and reanalysis in searching for connections and especially in differentiating between what belongs to the analyst and what belongs to the analysand. A certain degree of unbinding ensures the preservation of something ungraspable that protects one from the other's appropriation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: Although the clinical benefits of pharmacological treatments for insomnia have been studied, no systematic assessment of their economic value has been reported. This analysis assessed, from a broad payer and societal perspective, the cost effectiveness of long-term treatment with eszopiclone (LUNESTA™, Sepracor Inc., [Marlborough, MA, USA]) for chronic primary insomnia in adults in the US. Methods: A decision analytical model was developed based on the reanalysis of a 6-month placebo-controlled trial, which demonstrated that eszopiclone 3mg significantly improved sleep and daytime function measures versus placebo in adults with primary insomnia. Patients were classified as either having remitted or not remitted from insomnia based upon a composite index of eight sleep and daytime function measures collected during the trial. These data were supplemented with quality-of-life and healthcare and lost productivity cost data from the published literature and medical and absenteeism claims databases. Results: Compared with non-remitted patients, patients classified as remitted had lower monthly healthcare and productivity costs (in 2006 dollars) [a reduction of $US242 and $US182, respectively] and higher quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) weight (a net gain of 0.0810 on a scale ranging from 0 to 1). During the study, eszopiclone-treated patients were about 2.5 times more likely to have remitted than placebo-treated patients. Six months of eszopiclone treatment reduced direct (healthcare) and indirect (productivity) costs by an estimated $US245.13 and $US184.19 per patient, respectively. Eszopiclone use was associated with a cost of $US497.15 per patient over 6 months (including drug cost, dispensing fee, physician visit and time loss to receive care). Thus, after considering the above savings and the costs associated with eszopiclone treatment over 6 months, cost increased by $US252.02 (excluding productivity gains) and $US67.83 (including productivity gains) per person. However, eszopiclone treatment was also associated with a net QALY gain of 0.006831 per patient over the same period. Consequently, the incremental cost per QALY gained associated with eszopiclone was approximately $US9930 (including productivity gains [i.e. $US67.83 ÷ 0.006831]) and $US36 894 (excluding productivity gains [i.e. $US252.02 ÷ 0.006831]). Sensitivity analyses using a variety of scenarios suggested that eszopiclone is generally cost effective. Conclusions: This analysis suggested that long-term eszopiclone treatment was cost effective over the 6-month study period, particularly when the impact on productivity costs is considered. Given the increasing interest in new pharmacological interventions to manage insomnia, payers and clinicians alike should carefully consider the balance of health and economic benefits that these interventions offer. Accordingly, additional research in this area is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Bilingual children's language and literacy is stronger in some domains than others. Reanalysis of data from a broad-scale study of monolingual English and bilingual Spanish-English learners in Miami provided a clear demonstration of "profile effects," where bilingual children perform at varying levels compared to monolinguals across different test types. The profile effects were strong and consistent across conditions of socioeconomic status, language in the home, and school setting (two way or English immersion). The profile effects indicated comparable performance of bilingual and monolingual children in basic reading tasks, but lower vocabulary scores for the bilinguals in both languages. Other test types showed intermediate scores in bilinguals, again with substantial consistency across groups. These profiles are interpreted as primarily due to the "distributed characteristic" of bilingual lexical knowledge, the tendency for bilingual individuals to know some words in one language but not the other and vice versa.

Abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read and made acceptability judgments about sentences containing three types of adjective sequences: (1) normal sequences--e.g., Jennifer rode a huge gray elephant; (2) reversed sequences that violate grammatical-semantic constraints on linear order--e.g., *Jennifer rode a gray huge elephant; and (3) contradictory sequences that violate lexical-semantic constraints on compositionality--e.g., *Jennifer rode a small huge elephant. Relative to the control condition, the second adjective elicited a reduced N400 and an enhanced P600 in both the reversal condition and the contradiction condition. We present several alternative accounts of these two effects, but favor an interpretation which treats them as reflecting semantic and syntactic aspects of a temporary reanalysis of the adjective order construction. Furthermore, relative to the control condition, the final noun elicited a robust N400 in the contradiction condition but not in the reversal condition. We suggest that this effect indexes the full registration of the lexical-semantic incompatibility of the two adjectives in the contradiction condition. Finally, we discuss how all of these findings fit into the broader context of recent ERP studies that have reported atypical N400s and robust P600s in response to certain types of semantic anomalies.

Abstract = {In the present research, the authors hypothesized that additive counterfactual thinking mind-sets, activated by adding new antecedent elements to reconstruct reality, promote an expansive processing style that broadens conceptual attention and facilitates performance on creative generation tasks, whereas subtractive counterfactual thinking mind-sets, activated by removing antecedent elements to reconstruct reality, promote a relational processing style that enhances tendencies to consider relationships and associations and facilitates performance on analytical problem-solving tasks. A reanalysis of a published data set suggested that the counterfactual mind-set primes previously used in the literature tend to evoke subtractive counterfactuals. Studies 1 and 2 then demonstrated that subtractive counterfactual mind-sets enhanced performance on analytical problem-solving tasks relative to additive counterfactual mind-sets, whereas Studies 3 and 4 found that additive counterfactual mind-sets enhanced performance on creative generation tasks relative to subtractive counterfactual mind-sets.

Abstract = {The dilution effect refers to the finding that judgments are often unduly influenced by nondiagnostic information, producing regressive judgment. The hypothesis of a conversational basis of the dilution effect, advanced in a recent study by Igou and Bless (see record [rid]2005-02029-002[/rid]), holds that the effect reflects the operation of the conversational norm of relevance. A critique and reanalysis of their data yields only weak, if any, support for this conversational explanation. Furthermore, an experiment (n = 224) does not yield any supportive evidence, and a meta-analysis of available studies likewise supports the conclusion that the dilution effect occurs independently of the operation of conversational norms. However, consistent with a social-perceptual explanation, the experiment shows that the dilution effect occurs only for individuals high in personal need for structure. Although conversational norms do not provide the basis for the dilution effect, how they are involved in eliminating this reasoning error is discussed.

Abstract = {Previous work has shown a relationship between parietal lobe anatomy and nonnative speech sound learning. We scanned a new group of phonetic learners using structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Voxel-based morphometry indicated higher white matter (WM) density in left Heschl's gyrus (HG) in faster compared with slower learners, and manual segmentation of this structure confirmed that the WM volume of left HG is larger in the former compared with the latter group. This finding was replicated in a reanalysis of the original groups tested in Golestani and others (2002, Anatomical correlates of learning novel speech sounds. Neuron 35:997-1010). We also found that faster learners have a greater asymmetry (left > right) in parietal lobe volumes than slower learners and that the right insula and HG are more superiorly located in slower compared with faster learners. These results suggest that left auditory cortex WM anatomy, which likely reflects auditory processing efficiency, partly predicts individual differences in an aspect of language learning that relies on rapid temporal processing. It also appears that a global displacement of components of a right hemispheric language network, possibly reflecting individual differences in the functional anatomy and lateralization of language processing, is predictive of speech sound learning.

Processing disruption was observed when items occurring between a head and a dependent overlapped with either (or both) syntactic or semantic features of the dependent. Effects of syntactic interference occur in the earliest online measures in the region where the retrieval of a long-distance dependent occurs. Semantic interference effects occur in later online measures at the end of the sentence. Both effects endure in offline comprehension measures, suggesting that interfering items participate in incorrect interpretations that resist reanalysis. The data are discussed in terms of a cue-based retrieval account of parsing, which reconciles the fact that the parser must violate the grammar in order for these interference effects to occur. Broader implications of this research indicate a need for a precise specification of the interface between the parsing mechanism and the memory system that supports language comprehension.

Abstract = {The purpose of this research report is to highlight a unique set of issues that arise when considering the effects of range restriction in the context of estimating predictor intercorrelations. Three approaches are used to illustrate the issue: simulation, a concrete applied example, and a reanalysis of a meta-analysis of ability-interview correlations. The general conclusion is that a predictor intercorrelation can differ dramatically from the population value when both predictors are used in a composite that is used operationally for selection. The compensatory nature of a composite means that low scorers on one predictor can only obtain high scores on the composite if they obtain very high scores on the other predictor; this phenomenon distorts the correlation between the predictors.

Abstract = {Stigma associated with HIV infection can unfavorably impact the lives and behavior of people living with HIV/AIDS. The HIV Stigma Scale was designed to measure the perception of stigma by those who are HIV infected. Reanalysis of the psychometric properties of this scale was conducted in a new sample of 157 individuals living with HIV/AIDS in rural New England. This resulted in revision of the scale: shortening it from 40 to 32 items and retaining the original four factors but renaming one: Enacted Stigma (formerly Personalized Stigma), Disclosure Concerns, Negative Self-image, and Concern With Public Attitudes. These four subscales have been refined such that each consists of unique items. Cronbach's alphas for the subscales ranged from .90 to .97, and .95 for the overall scale, indicating internal consistency. Correlations with other scales confirmed the validity of the HIV Stigma Scale in another sample of people living with HIV/AIDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Women, aged 24 to 79, completed the spiritual well-being (SWB) scale and other instruments. Results indicated a strong trend for African American women to score higher on religious well-being than Caucasian women. Comparisons of SWB item scores indicated areas of spiritual strengths for African American women: perceptions of God's concern for them, God's help with loneliness, fulfilling relationship with God, satisfaction with life, and sense of life's purpose. These findings have multidisciplinary implications for factors that may mitigate the illeffects of ESRD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of the analysis described here was to assess reproductive endocrine disorders in 148 women with epilepsy (WWE) by epilepsy type and antiepileptic drug use. Women with idiopathic generalized epilepsy had a higher prevalence of reproductive endocrine disorders than control subjects. In addition, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries, and polycystic ovary syndrome were more prevalent in WWE on valproate than in WWE taking other drugs or control women. The use of VPA was a predictor of the development of polycystic ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome, and the use of valproate and younger age predicted the development of hyperandrogenism. In conclusion, both idiopathic generalized epilepsy and valproate were associated with an increased risk of reproductive endocrine disorders in WWE in this post hoc reanalysis of data on a large number of WWE. This was especially evident if the epilepsy was active and required treatment early in life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {A new standard in effectiveness research on schizophrenia medications has been established by the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study. The study used an innovative approach to determining relative effectiveness of medications by using time until medication discontinuation or switch as the primary outcome criterion. The study is perhaps best known for the overall high proportion of subjects (74%) meeting all-cause discontinuation (ACD) criteria within the 18-month time frame of being assigned to their phase 1 antipsychotic. However, some of the drawbacks of the ACD approach are not well understood, in part because of unfamiliarity with the way ACD was assessed and problems with the use of hierarchical criteria to establish the primary reason for medication discontinuation. Using the lime until ACD as an endpoint cannot by itself capture the complexity of the trajectory of a patient's response to a new medication. In particular, it is quite plausible that switching medications upon entering CATIE phase 1 would reduce some symptoms, which then would lead to a greater desire to make another medication switch. Using ACD criteria, a comparison with CATIE subjects who coincidentally remained on treatment with their pre switch medication would make it seem that switching was detrimental when in fact it could have been helpful. Another major limitation of the ACD was omitting the recording of the reason for stopping study medication whenever the ACD was considered to be a "patient-decision" discontinuation. This means that patient-initiated discontinuations could never be classified as a tolerability discontinuation. Since the ACD was done by the patients' clinicians, this approach may have underestimated the proportion of side effect discontinuations whenever the patient disagreed with his or her clinician. Moreover, retaining the "patient-decision" discontinuation subgroup in the attributable risk estimates of tolerability discontinuations further minimizes the attributable risk estimate of the role of side effects relative to other causes of discontinuation. For these assumptions to be valid would require the very optimistic assumption that CATIE clinicians never underestimated tolerability concerns in their patients. Otherwise, this mutually exclusive approach will lead to significant underestimation of the proportion of CATIE discontinuations caused by tolerability problems. It can be argued that excluding the "patient decision" subgroup from the attributable risk estimate of role of tolerability in medication discontinuation is a better approach to mitigate against these biases. A reanalysis using an adjusted N of 1061 evaluable subjects changes the attributable portion of tolerability discontinuations from 14.9% to 38.5%. Regarding specific side effect-medication pairs of interest, the attributable risk of extrapyramidal symptoms as a reason for discontinuing perphenazine increases from 8% to 21 %, and weight-related discontinuations from olanzapine from 9% to 28%. Therefore, the clinical implications of the CATIE phase 1 findings may depend, in part, on the underlying assumptions of the ACD outcome measure.

Abstract = {The purpose of these reanalyses of the MARKUS-study (Helmke & Jäger, 2002) is to explore frequencies, appearance and performance of children with dyscalculia in higher school classes. Based on data of all 8th graders in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, the group of the low performing students (dyscalculia) was defined by the following criteria: Performance in the curriculum-based mathematical test below a percent range of 3% as well as at least satisfactory grades (grade 3 - "satisfactory" - or better according to German grading system) in other subjects (German and first foreign language). The group of students with such results (1% of population) has a proportion of girls which is above average and consists of students of all types of school. Students with dyscalculia performed poorly in all tasks of the TIMSS orientated test, independently of the complexity or type of task. Furthermore, students with dyscalculia seem to make more, but not different mistakes. These results indicate misconceptions that are developed systematically by the students and which will be discussed here. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In spite of the excellent temporal resolution of event-related EEG potentials (ERPs), the overlapping potentials evoked by masked and masking stimuli are hard to disentangle. However, when both masked and masking stimuli consist of pairs of relevant and irrelevant stimuli, one left and one right from fixation, with the side of the relevant element varying between pairs, effects of masked and masking stimuli can be distinguished by means of the contralateral preponderance of the potentials evoked by the relevant elements, because the relevant elements may independently change sides in masked and masking stimuli. Based on a reanalysis of data from which only selected contralateral-ipsilateral effects had been previously published, the present contribution will provide a more complete picture of the ERP effects in a masked-priming task. Indeed, effects evoked by masked primes and masking targets heavily overlapped in conventional ERPs and could be disentangled to a certain degree by contralateral-ipsilateral differences. Their major component, the N2pc, is interpreted as indicating preferential processing of stimuli matching the target template, which process can neither be identified with conscious perception nor with shifts of spatial attention. The measurements showed that the triggering of response preparation by the masked stimuli did not depend on their discriminability, and their priming effects on the processing of the following target stimuli were qualitatively different for stimulus identification and for response preparation. These results provide another piece of evidence for the independence of motor-related and perception-related effects of masked stimuli. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Reanalyses of placebo-controlled trials reveal an increased risk of suicidal ideations or parasuicidal acts in children and adolescents under treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or other antidepressants. Although no completed suicide was shown, these findings are the more important because, with the exception of fluoxetine, an evidence base for the efficacy of antidepressants is weak or lacking in this age group. For adults, there is no reason to doubt that antidepressants help to reduce suicides by shortening depressive episodes and preventing recurrence. A general and pronounced suicide-inducing effect of SSRI or other antidepressants can largely be excluded. On the other hand, in some vulnerable patients the risk of suicidal acts can increase, especially during the first days of antidepressant treatment. There is no evidence that this risk is higher with SSRI than with other antidepressants or nonpharmacological treatments. Safety in case of overdose is a strong argument favouring newer antidepressants over tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants in outpatients with unclear suicidality. The current widespread public discussions concering the risks of antidepressants is a risk in itself because confidence in treatment, compliance, and help seeking behaviour may get influenced negatively.

Abstract = {Although expressed emotion (EE) has been demonstrated to be associated with the course of schizophrenia, the nature of this relationship is unclear. This study proposes that testing for curvilinear relationships can identify the specific nature of the relationships between EE indices and relapse. The utility of curvilinear models was explored through a reanalysis of data from a prior study of EE among Mexican-Americans (Karno et al., 1987). The results suggest that the relationship between the EE index of emotional overinvolvement (EOI) and relapse is curvilinear and that high levels of EOI may exert a toxic effect on course of illness whereas medium levels of EOI may be protective. The relationship between the EE index of warmth and relapse is also curvilinear and high levels of warmth appear to exert a protective effect on the course of illness. The role of culture is explored in explaining the specific manner in which EE relates to relapse among Mexican-Americans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The authors examined whether students in Germany show differential achievement gains in 8th grade mathematics as a function of the school type they attend. In a recent article, Schneider and Stefanek (2004) argued that such differential achievement trajectories do not exist. In a reanalysis of the national longitudinal extension of the German TIMSS sample (N = 1864 students at the end of grades 7 and 8), latent change models were used to examine achievement gains in mathematics in the three tracks of the German secondary system by means of multigroup structural equation modeling. Differential achievement trajectories were found across the three school types, with differences amounting to between .25 and .79 of a standard deviation at the latent level. These findings lend support to the argument that students in different school types in Germany show differential learning trajectories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

The present paper draws on Bakhtinian and Meadian theories to analyse the three key paragraphs in the Meditations in which Descartes argues this point. The analysis demonstrates: (1) that Descartes' text contains the traces of significant others and the discourses of his time; (2) that the sequence of thoughts that leads Descartes to his first principle is fundamentally dialogical; (3) that Descartes' self-awareness, which he takes as primary, depends upon his reflecting upon himself from the perspective of a more or less generalized other; and finally (4) that Descartes takes the perspective of the other by reversing his own reactions towards others, such that he reacts to himself in the same way that he previously reacted to others.

Abstract = {The present study investigated the role of proficiency in late second-language (L2) processing using comparable stimuli in German and Italian. Both sets of stimuli consisted of simple active sentences including a word category violation, a morphosyntactic agreement violation, or a combination of the two. Four experiments were conducted to study high- and low-proficiency L2 learners of German as well as high- and lowproficiency L2 learners of Italian. High-proficiency L2 learners in both languages showed the same event-related potential (ERP) components as native speakers for all syntactic violations. For the word category violation, they displayed an early anterior negativity (ELAN), an additional negativity reflecting reference-related processes, and a late P600 evidencing processes of reanalysis. For the processing of the morphosyntactic error, an anterior negativity (LAN) and a P600 were observed, whereas for the combined violation, the same ERP components were found as in the pure category violation. In high-proficiency L2 learners, the timing of the processing steps was equivalent to that of native speakers, although some amplitude differences were present. Low-proficiency L2 learners, however, showed qualitative differences in the agreement violation characterized by the absence of the LAN and quantitative differences reflected in a delayed P600 in every violation condition. These findings emphasize that with a high proficiency, late L2 learners can indeed show native-like neural responses with the timing approximating that of native speakers. This challenges the idea that there are fundamental differences in language processing in the brain between natives and late L2 learners. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Since reasoning about distribution is a complex and challenging research topic, this special issue presents a series of papers on the topic. The first paper is based on the opening address at Statistical Reasoning, Thinking and Literacy (SRTL-4) and is designed to delve deeply into issues of distributional reasoning and its purpose from a statistician's perspective. The next paper proposes a model for reasoning from the comparison of box plots based on one secondary teacher's articulation of these comparisons whilst teaching. This model is intended as a guide for teacher reasoning and to inform the design of teaching sequences. Next paper describes levels of reasoning about distribution based on the SOLO taxonomy that could be used to assess students' development of such reasoning ability and to structure learning sequences. This hierarchy emerged from the reanalysis of tertiary students' responses that had shown various levels of reasoning about variation. Next reports on a virtual simulation designed to allow students to use causality to articulate features of distribution. This latest iteration of software under development acts as a "window on thinking-in-change" by allowing the students to explore the relationship between causality and variation. Last paper reports on the developing understanding of distribution as elementary pre-service teachers compared distributions of data that were created during practical investigations. The use of the experimental context in this study was found to support the construction of a distributional perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: In a previous study the effectiveness of vocational therapy was evaluated using the Osnabrück Profile of Working Abilities (O-AFP). No or only minor effects were detected. The goal of this reanalysis is to identify distinct responder groups. Methods: Hierarchical cluster analysis of O-AFP-scores before and after treatment, anovas, t-statistics as well as regression and discriminant analyses were applied to specify the clusters. Results: For each of the O-AFP-scales (Learning Ability, Social Communication Ability, Adaptation) three subgroups different in level and slope of abilities could be identified. Improvements with medium to high effect sizes were detected for Social Communication Ability (34%) and Learning Ability (14% of the patients), deterioration was found in 30% of the patients for Adaptation. Subgroups could be described with the help of symptomatology. Further variables and subgroup membership could be predicted above chance by discriminant and regression analysis. Conclusion: Targeted and more appropriate design of vocational therapy seems necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In educational research, characteristics of the learning environment are generally assessed by asking students to evaluate features of their lessons. The student ratings produced by this simple and efficient research strategy can be analysed from two different perspectives. At the individual level, they represent the individual student's perception of the learning environment. Scores aggregated to the classroom level reflect perceptions of the shared learning environment, corrected for individual idiosyncrasies. This second approach is often pursued in studies on teaching quality and effectiveness, where student-level ratings are aggregated to the class level to obtain general information about the learning environment. Although this strategy is widely applied in educational research, neither the reliability of aggregated student ratings nor the within-group agreement between the students in a class has been subject to much investigation. The present study introduces and discusses different procedures that have been proposed in the field of organisational psychology to assess the reliability and agreement of students' ratings of their instruction. The application of the proposed indexes is demonstrated by a reanalysis of student ratings of mathematics instruction obtained in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (N = 2,064 students in 100 classes).

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the cognitive effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine, with a post-hoc exploratory reanalysis of a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial comparing memantine (20 mg per day) to placebo in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease (AD) receiving treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil. Methods: The effects of memantine on individual items of the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), subscale performance, and 3 post-hoc-derived aggregate subscales were investigated. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population using last observation carried forward and observed cases approaches. The SIB components were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24. Results: The mean change from baseline by visit and at study end point on the SIB showed statistically significant differences between the memantine and placebo groups at all visits beginning at week 8 (last observation carried forward and observed cases). The SIB subscale analysis showed statistically significantly greater effects of memantine than placebo on memory, language, and praxis. When the SIB domains were aggregated using a face valid approach to create 3 higher-order subscales, memantine treatment resulted in statistically significant differences on memory, language, and praxis compared with placebo. Conclusions: These post-hoc analyses support the beneficial effects of memantine on cognition observed in a previously reported clinical trial. The results presented here suggest an effect of memantine on memory, language, and praxis in patients with moderate to severe AD and support the efficacy of memantine for the treatment of cognitive deficits in AD.

Abstract = {In the present study, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to compare auditory sentence comprehension in 16 children with developmental dyslexia (age 9-12 years) and unimpaired controls matched on age, sex, and nonverbal intelligence. Passive sentences were presented, which were either correct or contained a syntactic violation (phrase structure) or a semantic violation (selectional restriction). In an overall sentence correctness judgment task, both control and dyslexic children performed well. In the ERPs, control children and dyslexic children demonstrated a similar N400 component for the semantic violation. For the syntactic violation, control children demonstrated a combined pattern, consisting of an early starting bilaterally distributed anterior negativity and a late centro-parietal positivity (P600). Dyslexic children showed a different pattern that is characterized by a delayed left lateralized anterior negativity, followed by a P600. These data indicate that dyslexic children do not differ from unimpaired controls with respect to semantic integration processes (N400) or controlled processes of syntactic reanalyses (P600) during auditory sentence comprehension. However, early and presumably highly automatic processes of phrase structure building reflected in the anterior negativity are delayed in dyslexic children. Moreover, the differences in hemispheric distribution of the syntactic negativity indicate different underlying processes in dyslexic children and controls. The bilateral distribution in controls suggests an involvement of right hemispherically established prosodic processes in addition to the left hemispherically localized syntactic processes, supporting the view that prosodic information may be used to facilitate syntactic processing during normal comprehension. The left hemispheric distribution observed for dyslexic children, in contrast, suggests that these children do not rely on information about the prosodic contour during auditory sentence comprehension as much as controls do. This finding points toward a phonological impairment in dyslexic children that might hamper the development of syntactic processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The origin of the present comment lies in a failed attempt to obtain, through e-mailed requests, data reported in 141 empirical articles recently published by the American Psychological Association (APA). Our original aim was to reanalyze these data sets to assess the robustness of the research findings to outliers. We never got that far. In June 2005, we contacted the corresponding author of every article that appeared in the last two 2004 issues of four major APA journals. Because their articles had been published in APA journals, we were certain that all of the authors had signed the APA Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles, which includes the principle on sharing data for reanalysis. Unfortunately, 6 months later, after writing more than 400 e-mails--and sending some corresponding authors detailed descriptions of our study aims, approvals of our ethical committee, signed assurances not to share data with others, and even our full resumes-we ended up with a meager 38 positive reactions and the actual data sets from 64 studies (25.7% of the total number of 249 data sets). This means that 73% of the authors did not share their data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present study is a reanalysis of a preexisting study examining the usefulness of the Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification (AMBIANCE; Bronfman, Parsons, & Lyons-Ruth, 1999) measure as an indicator of efficacy in reducing disrupted caregiver behavior in two brief interventions. The current study examines the rate of change in the display of disrupted caregiver behavior over the course of an attachment-based intervention (Modified Interaction Guidance) in a group of 11 caregiver-infant dyads referred to a tertiary care clinic for feeding problems. The AMBIANCE was utilized as an indicator of change in disrupted behavior following an assessment feedback session and three intervention sessions. Results showed a significant decrease in the total display of disrupted caregiver behaviors, as well as a change in classification from disrupted to not-disrupted, after receiving both feedback from the assessment and the first treatment session. A qualitative analysis of the data further revealed different patterns of change between caregivers. These findings provide preliminary empirical support suggesting that a reduction of disrupted caregiver behavior can be observed relatively quickly after the commencement of the Modified Interaction Guidance intervention.

Abstract = {Objectives: Although several studies have established different cutpoints (CPs) for mild, moderate, and severe pain for a variety of chronic pain conditions, only one study by Mendoza and colleagues reported on CPs for acute postoperative pain that were derived using ratings of worst pain. The purpose of this study was to explore the establishment of the optimal CPs for mild, moderate, and severe postoperative pain using ratings of average and worst pain and to determine if these CPs distinguished among the pain severity groups on several outcomes. Methods: The study is a reanalysis of data from patients who underwent hip and knee replacement surgery. Using the methodology described by Serlin et al, a series of CP derivations were performed based on both single item scores for pain intensity and mean scores for pain intensity. One-way analyses of variance, χ² analyses, or Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to determine if the optimal CPs for pain severity distinguished among the 3 pain severity groups on several outcomes. Results: CPs 3,5 were found using a mean score based on patients' ratings of average and worst pain on the third postoperative day. Findings suggest that mean pain scores of >3 have a significant effect on general activity, mood, walking ability, and sleep. Discussion: Possible explanations for the differences in the CPs found in this study compared with the results by Mendoza and colleagues are discussed. The findings warrant replication in other samples of postoperative patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This article reanalyses and reviews data from the two published randomized clinical trials comparing escitalopram and venlafaxine XR in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. The aim was to further compare the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram and venlafaxine XR and to assess the impact of the two treatments on the patient's quality of life, as well as the benefit/risk of treatment. A total of 243 escitalopram-treated patients and 240 venlafaxine XR-treated patients were included in this analysis. Comparable treatment efficacy was achieved with respect to the prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint (mean change from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at week 8). An analysis of the outcome at the end of study by baseline severity showed that the treatment difference became greater the more severely depressed the patients were at baseline. At the highest permitted doses, in the subgroup of patients who were severely depressed (baseline MADRS ≥ 30), patients treated with escitalopram had a statistically significantly greater improvement (P < 0.05) in mean MADRS total scores than patients treated with venlafaxine XR at endpoint. For these patients, treatment with 20 mg/day escitalopram resulted in a statistically significantly (P < 0.05) higher remission rate at week 8 (47%) than treatment with venlafaxine XR (29%). This difference was confirmed by the analysis of the pooled data, which showed that patients in the escitalopram group had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher mean number of depression-free days (30.4 days) than those in the venlafaxine XR group (26.2 days) over the 8-week period. The relative benefit of escitalopram versus venlafaxine XR was 1.46, indicating that a patient was more likely to benefit from treatment with escitalopram. The proportions of patients who withdrew owing to adverse events were 7.5% in the escitalopram group and 11.2% in the venlafaxine XR group. The mean number of discontinuation emergent signs and symptoms in the venlafaxine XR group (mean: 5.0) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than for the escitalopram group (mean: 2.4).

Abstract = {Two experiments in which participants named pictured objects with difficult or easier names, and a reanalysis and review of published data, reveal that problematic measures used in previous studies obscured the implications of group differences in tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) rates. In Experiment 1, increased age led to more TOTs for difficult but not easy targets. In Experiment 2, bilinguals had more TOTs than monolinguals for easy targets but fewer TOTs for difficult targets. The authors developed a theoretically motivated measure that clarifies the implications of TOT data by linking all responses elicited in the TOT paradigm with either success or failure in completing 2 retrieval steps in current models of language production. The 2-step analysis reveals a common mechanism for the age and bilingualism effects and implies that age has both positive and negative effects on retrieval.

Abstract = {Background: Medical education is moving toward developing guidelines using the evidence-based approach; however, controlled data are missing for answering complex treatment decisions such as those made during suicide attempts. A new set of statistical techniques called data mining (or machine learning) is being used by different industries to explore complex databases and can be used to explore large clinical databases. Method: The study goal was to reanalyze, using data mining techniques, a published study of which variables predicted psychiatrists' decisions to hospitalize in 509 suicide attempters over the age of 18 years who were assessed in the emergency department. Patients were recruited for the study between 1996 and 1998. Traditional multivariate statistics were compared with data mining techniques to determine variables predicting hospitalization. Results: Five analyses done by psychiatric researchers using traditional statistical techniques classified 72% to 88% of patients correctly. The model developed by researchers with no psychiatric knowledge and employing data mining techniques used 5 variables (drug consumption during the attempt, relief that the attempt was not effective, lack of family support, being a housewife, and family history of suicide attempts) and classified 99% of patients correctly (99% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Conclusions: This reanalysis of a published study fundamentally tries to make the point that these new multivariate techniques, called data mining, can be used to study large clinical databases in psychiatry. Data mining techniques may be used to explore important treatment questions and outcomes in large clinical databases and to help develop guidelines for problems where controlled data are difficult to obtain. New opportunities for good clinical research may be developed by using data mining analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Studies of source monitoring have played an important role in cognitive investigations of the inner/outer confusions that characterize hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia, and multinomial modelling is a statistical/cognitive modelling technique that provides a powerful method for analyzing source monitoring data. The purpose of the current work is to describe how multinomial models can be optimized to answer direct questions about hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia research. To demonstrate this, we present a reanalysis of previously published source monitoring data, comparing a group of patients with schneiderian first rank symptoms to a group without schneiderian first rank symptoms. The main findings of this analysis were (1) impaired recognition of self-generated items and (2) evidence that impaired source discrimination of perceived items is accompanied by an internalization bias in the target symptom group. Statistical and cognitive interpretations of the findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The processing of syntactic violations in adults is associated with a biphasic event-related potential pattern consisting of an early left anterior negativity and a late positivity called the P600. While the early left anterior negativity reflects highly automatic sentence parsing, the P600 reflects processes of syntactic reanalyses or repair. The present study investigated the processing of phrase structure information in 24-month-old German-speaking children. During the experimental session, the children listened to short active sentences that were either syntactically correct or contained a phrase structure violation. The event-related potential s of the children displayed a late positivity in response to phrase structure violations. Our findings indicate that even children at this early age are sensitive to syntactic errors in the form of phrase structure violations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {When asked to recall the words from a just-presented target list, subjects occasionally recall words that were not on the list. These intrusions either appeared on earlier lists (prior-list intrusions, or PLIs) or had not appeared over the course of the experiment (extra-list intrusions). The authors examined the factors that elicit PLIs in free recall. A reanalysis of earlier studies revealed that PLIs tend to come from semantic associates as well as from recently studied lists, with the rate of PLIs decreasing sharply with list recency. The authors report 3 new experiments in which some items in a given list also appeared on earlier lists. Although repetition enhanced recall of list items, subjects were significantly more likely to make PLIs following the recall of repeated items, suggesting that temporal associations formed in earlier lists can induce recall errors. The authors interpret this finding as evidence for the interacting roles of associative and contextual retrieval processes in recall. Although contextual information helps to focus recall on words in the target list, it does not form an impermeable boundary between current- and prior-list experiences.

Abstract = {Much of the research on psychopathy has treated it as a unitary construct operationalized by total scores on one (or more) measures. More recent studies on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) suggest the existence of two distinct facets of psychopathy with unique external correlates. Here, the authors report reanalyses of two offender data sets that included scores on the PPI along with various theoretically relevant criterion variables. Consistent with hypotheses, the two PPI factors showed convergent and discriminant relations with criterion measures, many of which would otherwise have been obscured when relying on PPI total scores. These results highlight the importance of examining facets of psychopathy as well as total scores. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Rejoinder to the reply by B. Hitsman et al. (see record [rid]2004-17824-009[/rid]) on the comments made by Lirio S. Covey, Andrew Bomback and Grace Wei Yin Yan (see record [rid]2004-17824-008[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2003-06685-003[/rid]) regarding history of depression and smoking cessation outcomes. This communication attempts to provide further clarification on the effect of past major depression history on smoking cessation. First, we present results of a reanalysis in which data on study participants who received the experimental (e.g., bupropion, fluoxetine, clonidine, cognitivebehavioral therapy: CBT) or known active (e.g., nicotine patch) treatment for the purpose of smoking cessation were examined separately from data on participants who received the inactive (i.e., placebo) medication or, in the case of psychological treatment studies, a standard, less intensive behavioral treatment (e.g., health education counseling). Second, we present findings from a clinical trial pertinent to the effect on smoking cessation of single (S-MDD) versus recurrent (R-MDD) history of major depression.

Abstract = {The authors reanalyze the data of a study by S. M. Elias and R. J. Loomis (2004), which aimed to determine how an instructor's gender may influence his or her ability to gain student compliance. Elias and Loomis observed few significant gender effects using traditional multivariate analyses of variance. The authors reanalyze this data using the more appropriate statistical techniques for detecting ordinal interactions recommended by M. J. Strube and P. Bobko (1989) and S. M. Elias (2004). An ordinal interaction occurs when 1 cell of a 2 × 2 design is responsible for a significant interaction (e.g., female instructors suffering only when rated by male students). Reanalysis of the data resulted in more robust findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Recent controversies surrounding the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have highlighted the need to reassess potential benefits, as well as potential risks of this class of medications in the treatment of pediatric depression. The recent availability of data from meta-analyses of published and unpublished antidepressant trials, epidemiological studies, and the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) has facilitated a reanalysis of this risk/benefit relationship. Despite reviewing similar data, various regulatory agencies have arrived at rather disparate conclusions regarding the data, resulting in continued controversy. Although all groups appear to agree that careful assessment, education regarding risks, and closer monitoring are essential for SSRIs, only the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.K. Medicine and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency maintain that an acceptable risk/benefit relationship exists for fluoxetine. The European Medicines Agency concluded that the SSRIs should not be used in the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The authors of this review have taken into consideration many of these same data and offer a critical discussion of the pros and cons of SSRIs in pediatric depression. The authors have concluded that SSRIs--in particular, fluoxetine--do have a role in the treatment of pediatric depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The aim of the current study was to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate potential irregularities in neurochemical compounds in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the extent to which these irregularities are related to state anxiety. Single voxel MRS was used to image the head of the caudate nucleus (HOC) and orbitofrontal white matter (OFWM) bilaterally in adult patients with OCD and a control group. The results indicated that patients with OCD had increased levels of a combined measure of glutamate and glutamine (Glx/Cr) and N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (NAA/Cr) relative to creatine in the right OFWM and reduced levels of myo-inositol relative to creatine (mI/Cr) in the HOC bilaterally. Correlational analyses indicated that Glx/Cr in the OFWM was related to OCD symptoms, while mI/Cr in the HOC was related to trait and/or state anxiety. Reanalysis of the significant group differences controlling for state anxiety symptoms erased three of the four group differences. These results are discussed in context of the methodological difficulties facing this area of research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study explored whether long-term yoga/meditation practice facilitates psi awareness. Data were collected in an Indian ashram setting in 2003 and 2004 from yoga practitioners with three levels of initiation: students (ST) (0.3-15 years practice); sanyassins (SN) (1-10 years practice); and swamis (SW) (4-33 years practice). These preliminary experiments focused on adapting Western laboratory procedures to the ashram setting with a Macintosh laptop serving as a portable laboratory. Participants had a short meditation followed by an awareness period to precognitively perceive a target video clip that they would see at the end of the session. They then rated four target clips on a 1 to 100 scale for similarity with their awareness experience. A reanalysis (using effect size r) showed no overall significant effect in either year (2003: r = -0.09; 2004: r = 0.08). Advanced practitioners (SW) in both years showed nonsignificant psi-hitting (2003: r = 0.21; 2004: r = 0.07), whereas the other two groups (SN and ST) were more variable in their scoring (2003: SN r = -0.23 and ST r = -0.38; 2004: SN r = 0.05 & ST r = 0.13). In 2003, in line with the hypothesis, the advanced group (SW) scored significantly better than SN (p = .05) or ST (p = .04). In 2004 these differences became nonsignificant. Implications and possible explanations are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper presents an application of temporal neural networks for downscaling global climate models (GCMs) output. Because of computational constraints, GCMs are usually run at coarse grid resolution (in the order of 100s of kilometres) and as a result they are inherently unable to present local sub-grid scale features and dynamics. Consequently, outputs from these models cannot be used directly in many climate change impact studies. This research explored the issues of 'downscaling' the outputs of GCMs using a temporal neural network (TNN) approach. The method is proposed for downscaling daily precipitation and temperature series for a region in northern Quebec, Canada. The downscaling models are developed and validated using large-scale predictor variables derived from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data set. The performance of the temporal neural network downscaling model is also compared to a regression-based statistical downscaling model with emphasis on their ability in reproducing the observed climate variability and extremes. The downscaling results for the base period (1961-2000) suggest that the TNN is an efficient method for downscaling both daily precipitation as well as daily maximum and minimum temperature series. Furthermore, the different model test results indicate that the TNN model mostly outperforms the statistical models for the downscaling of daily precipitation extremes and variability.

Abstract = {Previous research by J. M. Hinson, T. L. Jameson, and P. Whitney (2003; see record [rid]2003-02055-011[/rid]) demonstrated that a secondary task in a delayed discounting paradigm increased subjects' preference for the immediate reward. J. M. Hinson et al. interpreted their findings as evidence that working memory load results in greater impulsivity. The present authors conducted a reanalysis of the data from J. M. Hinson et al.'s Experiment 1 at the individual-subject level. Difference scores were calculated by subtracting the digit memory load condition from the control condition for k (discounting parameter) and a measure of "erroneous" responses. The results indicated that the secondary task increased random responding, which in turn can account for the increased mean estimates of k. Thus, the data do not support the claim that cognitive load affects impulsivity per se. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article, "Double-blind review favours increased representation of female authors" by A. E. Budden et al. (2008). The authors claimed that double-blind review is associated with an increased representation of female authors. They found that the journal Behavioral Ecology (BE) has published significantly more articles with female first authors since it changed its policy and initiated double-blind review in 2001. However, an increase in the proportion of female authors could not be found in similar journals that during the same period of time continued to practice single-blind review (Animal Behavior (AB), Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology (BES), Journal of Biogeography (JB), and Landscape Ecology (LE)). A problem with Budden et al.'s analysis is that the proportion of female authors in the respective journals was initially very different. Our reanalysis could not confirm that double-blind review has any detectable positive effect. It is thus simply too premature to conclude that the representation of female authors is favored by a double-blind review process. We believe that more target-oriented actions are needed to facilitate the scientific careers of female scientists, especially at young ages.

McCambridge presents a case study of publication bias in reviews of school-based drug education programmes. He reports that a reanalysis of 207 studies of the effects of such programmes resulted in different conclusions than those derived from previous meta-analyses. McCambridge points to several important aspects of such a publication bias, both with respect to how we may explain its occurrence and with respect to implications for policy and practice. Publication bias is of particular concern due to its potential consequences for policy and practice in the field. McCambridge points to the need for unbiased evidence on drug prevention in schools. In the Norwegian case it seems likely that the published evidence of effectiveness of the Youth & Alcohol programme has been a key factor for the recommendations of the programme by public health bodies.

An error appeared in the final paragraph of the introduction where the word 'reanalysis' was incorrectly reproduced as 'reanalyzing'. This error has been corrected below with the republication of this paragraph. The second problem was that recall outliers might affect the magnitude of the IQ-performance correlations (for a similar argument, see Larson and Alderton, 1990). For example, a small number of extremely low (or high) recall scores might exert substantial statistical leverage on the IQ-performance correlations and alter the outcome of the analysis. This problem was addressed by deleting the highest and lowest recall scores for each participant and then reanalyzing the data. Obtaining the same results in the reanalysis would minimize the possibility that recall outliers affected the outcome of the original analysis (involving all recall scores).

Abstract = {The research evidence regarding the potential effects of ecstasy suggests that it may be neurotoxic and that its use is associated with cognitive impairment. In recent years evidence has emerged suggesting that cannabinoids, the active ingredients in cannabis, can be neuroprotective under certain conditions. Given that many ecstasy users also consume cannabis at the same time, the possibility emerges that these individuals might be less susceptible to ecstasy-related impairment. The present paper reanalyses the data from a number of previous studies, contrasting the performance of those individuals who generally consume cannabis and ecstasy at the same time with those who generally consume ecstasy on its own. The two ecstasy-using groups are compared with non-ecstasy users on a range of measures including processing speed, random letter generation, verbal and visuo-spatial working memory span, reasoning and associative learning. The two ecstasy user groups did not differ significantly from each other on any of the measures. Both user groups were significantly worse than non-ecstasy users on measures of associative learning, verbal and visuo-spatial working memory and reasoning. The results suggest that consuming cannabis at the same time as ecstasy does not reduce the likelihood of cognitive impairment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Early components of visual evoked potentials (VEP) in EEG seem to be unaffected by target visibility in visual masking studies. Bridgeman's reanalysis of Jeffreys and Musselwhite's (1986) data suggests that a later visual component in the VEP, around 250 ms reflects the perceptual effect of masking. We challenge this view on the ground that temporal interactions between targets and masks unrelated to stimulus visibility could account for Bridgeman's observation of a U-shaped time course in VEP amplitudes for this later component. In an MEG experiment of metacontrast masking with variable stimulus onset asynchrony, we introduce a proper control, a pseudo mask. In contrast to an effective mask, the pseudomask should produce neither behavioral masking nor amplitude modulations of late VEPs. Our results show that effective masks produced a strong U-shaped perceptual effect of target visibility while performance remained virtually perfect when a pseudomask was used. The visual components around 250 ms after target onset did not show a distinction between mask and pseudomask conditions. The results indicate that these visual evoked potentials do not reveal neurophysiological correlates of stimulus visibility but rather reflect dynamic interactions between superimposed potentials elicited by stimuli in close temporal proximity. However, we observed a postperceptual component around 340 ms after target onset, located over temporal-parietal cortex, which shows a clear effect of visibility. Based on P300 ERP literature, this finding could indicate that working memory related processes contribute to metacontrast masking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

A brief introduction into the basic concepts of latent growth curve modeling will be given, particularly with regard to the advantages for the analysis of skill acquisition and its determinants.

Abstract = {Two current models of arithmetic fact retrieval, the network interference theory (NIT; Campbell, 1995) and the interacting neighbors (IN) model (Verguts & Fias, 2005a), predict that errors in simple multiplication should be more probable, if they include the same digit as the correct result (i.e., if they are "consistent," compared with "inconsistent" errors). In a reanalysis of error data originally reported by Campbell (1997), we provide first empirical evidence for this prediction. Furthermore, these results support the notion of different quantity representations for decades and units as proposed by Nuerk, Weger, and Willmes (2001). However, the NIT and IN-model differ in their explanations of the problem-size effect, a hallmark finding robustly observed in arithmetic fact retrieval. Only the IN-model predicts that a correct answer's neighborhood consistency can fully account for the problem-size effect, which was confirmed in our analysis.

Abstract = {Evaluating substance abuse services in ordinary treatment environments requires the use of instruments to measure various dimensions of the intervention process in order to link those processes with client outcomes. This paper reports on the further validation of the Alcohol and other Drug Self-Efficacy Scale (AODSES), designed to measure social workers' perceived self-efficacy with regard to the implementation of substance abuse services. In the first validation study, Kranz (2003) employed exploratory factor analysis to reduce the original 98 items to six factors (43 items) that accounted for 76% of the variance, and demonstrated excellent internal consistency. The current study is a reanalysis of the same data using confirmatory factor analysis, a more stringent test of construct validity. Results were strongly supportive of a 5-factor model with seven of eight indices showing excellent fit of the observed data to the model, and high internal consistency for all subscales. Potential practical applications for clinical evaluation in substance abuse environments and limitations of the study are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {We describe the space structuring model, a model of language comprehension inspired by ideas in cognitive linguistics, focusing on its capacity to explain the sorts of inferences needed to understand one-line jokes. One process posited in the model is frame-shifting, the semantic and pragmatic reanalysis in which elements of the existing message-level representation are mapped into a new frame retrieved from long-term memory. To test this model, we recorded participants' eye movements with a headband-mounted eye-tracker while they read sentences that ended either as a joke, or as nonfunny controls ("She read so much about the bad effects of smoking she decided to give up the reading/habit."). Only jokes required frame-shifting; nonjoke endings were consistent with the contextually evoked frame. Though initial gaze durations were the same for jokes and nonjokes, total viewing duration was longer for the jokes and participants were more likely to make regressive (leftward) eye movements after reading the "punch word" of a joke. Results are consistent with the psychological reality of some process like frame-shifting, suggesting readers literally revisit aspects of the prior context while apprehending one-line jokes.

Abstract = {We report 3 experiments that examined younger and older adults' reliance on "good-enough" interpretations for garden-path sentences (e.g., "While Anna dressed the baby played in the crib") as indicated by their responding "Yes" to questions probing the initial, syntactically unlicensed interpretation (e.g., "Did Anna dress the baby?"). The manipulation of several factors expected to influence the probability of generating or maintaining the unlicensed interpretation resulted in 2 major age differences: Older adults were generally more likely to endorse the incorrect interpretation for sentences containing optionally transitive verbs (e.g., hunted, paid), and they showed decreased availability of the correct interpretation of subordinate clauses containing reflexive absolute transitive verbs (e.g., dress, bathe). These age differences may in part be linked to older adults' increased reliance on heuristic-like good-enough processing to compensate for age-related deficits in working memory capacity. The results support previous studies suggesting that syntactic reanalysis may not be an all-or-nothing process and might not be completed unless questions probing unresolved aspects of the sentence structure challenge the resultant interpretation.

Abstract = {In the present study, the construction of a questionnaire measuring interpersonal personality traits via job-related acts based on the interpersonal Circumplex is described. The interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) is generally considered to be an adequate model for the representation of personality traits that refer to interpersonal behavior. So far, the IPC has been analyzed in several applied fields, but it has not yet been transferred into organizational psychology. It is shown that, in a circumplex-oriented reanalysis of data which were originally gathered using the five-factor model, operationalizing the IPC by means of job-related acts is possible. For this purpose conceptual expert judgments (N = 10, thereof 4 per act) as well as empirical results of a mixed student-employee sample (N = 278) were analyzed; furthermore, a structural construct validation is demonstrated with a student sample (N = 241) of mainly business students. The resulting questionnaire could be applied in personnel psychology as a socially and ecologically valid alternative to the classic measurement instrument, the Interpersonal Adjective Scales - Revised.

Abstract = {Introduction: This paper presents a new cognitive model of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. We suggest that auditory hallucinations are auditory representations derived from the unintentional activation of memories and other irrelevant current mental associations. Our model proposes that a combination of deficits in intentional inhibition and contextual memory is critical to the experience of auditory hallucinations. The failure in intentional inhibition produces unwanted and uncontrollable mental events which are not recognised because they have lost the contextual cues that would normally facilitate recognition. Methods: This article amalgamates recently published data and presents a reanalysis of the findings on 43 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (Badcock, Waters, Maybery, & Michie, 2005; Waters, Badcock, Maybery, & Michie, 2003a; Waters, Maybery, Badcock, & Michie, 2004a). Relative risk was also estimated to determine whether the combination of deficits increases the risk of having auditory hallucinations. Results: Almost 90% of patients currently experiencing auditory hallucinations showed the predicted combination of deficits on both inhibition and context memory, compared to only a third of patients without hallucinations. In addition, the results showed that those patients with the specified cognitive deficits were at an especially increased risk of having auditory hallucinations relative to patients without the deficits. Conclusions: The results of our investigations strongly support the role of intentional inhibition and context memory in auditory hallucinations. Critical consideration of the findings also suggests that additional cognitive processes might be important for the expression of this symptom.

Abstract = {This article will review evidence that led the Food and Drug Administration to issue a black-box warning about the risk of suicidality (suicidal thoughts and behavior) in children and adolescents during treatment with antidepressants. Reanalysis of data from randomized clinical trials of antidepressants in the pediatric population revealed a significantly greater risk of suicidality for drug groups (4%) compared to placebo groups (2%) in a sample of approximately 4,000 subjects. There were no completed suicides. The small but statistically significant risk of suicidality was not restricted to subjects being treated for depression. With respect to efficacy, only three (20%) of 15 antidepressant trials submitted to the FDA for pediatric depression demonstrated superiority of drug over placebo. The essential message of the black-box warning is to remind prescribes and consumers about the importance of monitoring patients closely for adverse behavioral changes during the initiation of (or changes in) antidepressant therapy. Implications of the FDA actions for clinical practice will also be addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether cumulated summed differences (cusums) can be used as a method for detecting effective interventions in chronic daily headache (CDH). If so, then can such interventions be detected sooner than 28 days? Background: CDH probably represents the greatest current challenge in the field of headache treatment. Clinical trial methodologies for its study are not standardized but usually use fixed 28-day observation periods. Similarly, 28-day observation periods are common review intervals for stepped-care patient management strategies. Methods: A theoretical patient was modeled, with daily headache scores that had maximal variation for 28 consecutive daily measures. The cusums for this "norm" or control data set were plotted and correlated with time using a simple spreadsheet. Departure of a postintervention cusum from the 95% confidence interval of the control data set was chosen as an indicator of sensitivity to various model perturbations that had clinical correlates. Results: When 1 to 17 randomly distributed headache-free days were used to perturb the 28-day model, cusums consistently diverged from the norm. If at least 3 headache-free days occurred, then the cusum detected the intervention in less than 28 days of observation. Reanalysis of a previously published study of magnesium oxide suggests that its negative conclusions should be reconsidered. Conclusion: Cusums can be useful tools for detecting change in CDH, whether at the level of the clinical trial or when managing patients using stepped-care treatment algorithms.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the clinical significance of changes in chronic pain in 2 disability groups: spinal cord injury and lower limb amputation. Methods: A reanalysis of 2 controlled clinical trials for pain in persons with disabilities. Eighty-two persons with spinal cord injuries and 34 persons with amputations provided pretreatment and posttreatment ratings of pain intensity on 0 to 10 numerical rating scales. After treatment, participants also rated the meaningfulness of any changes in pain they experienced. Results: An average decrease of 1.80 points on the 0 to 10 numerical rating scales and percent decreases of about 36% corresponded to reports of a meaningful change in pain. There was no significant difference between samples, and also no differences due to gender or treatment condition. Age and pretreatment pain, however, were associated with the amount of pain decrease rated as meaningful. The change in pain intensity rated as meaningful was greater for older participants and participants with higher levels of pretreatment pain. Consistent with previous research, percent change scores were less biased by pretreatment pain than were absolute change scores. Discussion: These findings are generally consistent with similar findings in other pain populations, and, in light of previous research, support an approximate 33% decrease in pain as a reasonable standard for meaningful change across chronic pain conditions. Percent change scores may be more useful for comparing the effects of pain treatments across samples or conditions because they are less biased by pretreatment pain level.

Abstract = {Summated scales are widely used in management research to measure constructs such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment. This article suggests that Revelle's (1979) coefficient beta, implemented in Revelle's (1978) ICLUST item-clustering procedure, should be used in conjunction with Cronbach's coefficient alpha measure of internal consistency as criteria for judging the dimensionality and internal homogeneity of summated scales. The approach is demonstrated using ICLUST reanalyses of sample responses to Warr's (1990) affective well-being scale and O'Brien, Dowling, and Kabanoff's (1978) job satisfaction scale. Coefficient beta and item clustering are shown to more clearly identify the homogeneity and internal dimensional structure of summated scale constructs than do traditional principal components analyses. Given these benefits, Revelle's approach is a viable alternative methodology for scale construction in management, organizational, and cross-cultural contexts, especially when researchers need to make defensible choices between using whole scales or subscales.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Textbook of Psychoanalysis by Ethel S. Person, Arnold Cooper, and Glen O. Gabbard (see record [rid]2005-01271-000[/rid]). One does not just sit down and read the Textbook of Psychoanalysis. It is an encyclopedia, not a textbook. It is a usually successful, wide-ranging work of reference, though uneven in quality and, with so many authors, inevitably repetitious. One very good feature is its usefulness as a review of the literature, helpful to clinicians and scholars both. While the Textbook's chapters are generally carefully thought out and well-organized, some chapters or, in one case, one whole section, are not successful. As to the former: the chapters by Efrain Bleiberg, "The Psychoanalytic Understanding of Mental Disorders: The Developmental Perspective," and Martin S. Bergmann, "Termination and Reanalysis," are clearly outstanding. But other chapters are disappointing. "Psychoanalysis: The Early Years" by Dario Colombo and Sander Abend is not always reliable. The textbook's section on "Psychoanalysis and Related Disciplines" is its least effective. There is a wide variety of approaches in each separate chapter, which, taken together, do not make a successful whole. The section also lacks a chapter on how historians use psychoanalysis in their work, in spite of the fact that there are quite a few historians who could have done a creditable job.

Abstract = {Flege, Bohn, and Jang (1997) and Escudero and Boersma (2004; see record [rid]2004-20431-002[/rid]) analyzed first language-Spanish second language-English listeners' perception of English /i/-/I/ continua that varied in spectral and duration properties. They compared individuals and groups on the basis of spectral reliance and duration reliance measures. These reliance measures indicate the change in identification rates from one extreme of the stimulus space to the other; they make use of only a portion of the data collected and suffer from a ceiling effect. The current paper presents a reanalysis of Escudero and Boersma's data using first-order logistic regression modeling. All of the available data contribute to the calculation of logistic regression coefficients, and they do not suffer from the same ceiling effect as the reliance measures. It is argued that--as a metric of cue weighting--logistic regression coefficients offer methodological and substantive advantages over the reliance measures.

Abstract = {Ongoing debate has questioned whether unipolar depression is a dimensional or categorical phenomenon. Although past studies using taxometric methods have supported a dimensional interpretation, each has suffered from methodological limitations. The present study was designed to overcome these limitations through reanalysis of the National Comorbidity Survey. Two indicator sets were constructed from the depression-relevant questions of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Participants who endorsed the lifetime occurrence of significant depressed mood or anhedonia (n = 4,577) were submitted to 2 nonredundant taxometric procedures (maximum eigenvalue and means above minus below a cut), additional consistency tests, and recently developed simulation techniques. All results converged on a dimensional solution. The implications of these findings on assessment, treatment, and research design are discussed.

Abstract = {Reply by the current author to the comments made by Ben Jann (see record [rid]2005-14513-007[/rid]) on the original article "Does the MarketPay Off? Earnings Returns to Education in Urban China." (2003). In his comment, Jann treats the three groups under discussion-stayers, early birds, and later entrants-as though they were symmetric, like those of an experimental design. In doing so, he borrows the language of multiple-group comparisons commonly used in analysis of variance (ANOVA) associated with experimental designs. The article was partly responsible for causing Jann's confusion, because his reanalysis is modeled. Extensive discussion in the article on the differential returns to education by sector makes it appear as if education is the causal factor, with sector as a covariate. However, our real research question concerned earnings differences by sector, with education as a confounder. For the first treatment, the "control" group consists of workers who did not make an early entry, and thus includes stayers as well as later entrants. For the second treatment, the "control" group consists of stayers only. There are two main findings from this propensity score analysis. First, the propensity model for a late transition differs from that for an early transition because the mechanisms for making transitions changed. Second, we find the treatment effect of market entry to be very different for a late transition than for an early transition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Somatic symptoms of depression such as fatigue create a diagnostic dilemma when assessing an older patient with medical comorbidities, since chronic medical illnesses may produce similar symptoms. Alternatively, somatic symptoms attributed to medical illness may actually be caused by depression. These analyses were designed to determine if somatic symptoms in older patients are more strongly associated with chronic physical problems or with depression. Design: Reanalysis of data from an observational study of depression in primary care and a randomized trial of paroxetine and nortriptyline for the treatment of major depression. Patients were evaluated with a structured diagnostic interview and a battery of psychiatric, physical, and psychosocial measures. Participants: Two hundred and forty eight primary care and psychiatric patients aged ≥60 years. Methods: Associations among depression, somatization, and chronic physical problems were examined using correlations and regression modeling. Results: Two somatization measures, the Asberg Side Effects Rating Scale and the Utvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU), were significantly associated with psychological symptoms of depression (r = 0.73 and r = 0.76, p <0.0001) but not with medical comorbidities (r = 0.02, p = 16 and r = 0.10, p = 0.78). In multiple regression models, psychological symptoms of depression remained significant predictors of somatization (p <0.0001) after controlling for age, gender, and medical comorbidities. Conclusions: In older patients with medical disorders and multiple somatic complaints, clinicians should consider the possibility of depression. Rating scales emphasizing somatic symptoms associated with depression may provide a more accurate measure of depression severity than those excluding such symptoms.

Abstract = {Visual spatial processing and object processing rely on dorsal and ventral cortical pathways, respectively. Whether this functional segregation exists in the prefrontal cortex is currently a source of debate. Using functional MRI (fMRI), there has been some evidence that the superior frontal sulcus (within dorsal prefrontal cortex) is specialised for spatial working memory, while ventral prefrontal cortex is associated with object working memory. Employing beta-weight analysis, Postle, Berger, Taich, and D'Esposito (see record [rid]2001-16008-001[/rid]) challenged these results, finding no differential activity associated with spatial working memory versus two-dimensional saccades in the superior frontal sulcus. In the present reanalysis of Postle et al.'s data, both beta-weight analysis and event-related timecourse analysis were utilised. Beta-weight analysis results replicated Postle et al.; however, timecourse analysis revealed greater activity associated with spatial working memory versus two-dimensional saccades in the superior frontal sulcus. Thus, identical fMRI data analysed via distinct methods yielded results with different theoretical conclusions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Schellenberg (see record [rid]2004-16745-002[/rid]) investigated whether music lessons improved IQ scores in young children in a pretest-posttest design. Six-year-old children were assigned to one of four treatment groups: keyboard instruction, Kodaly vocal instruction, drama instruction, or no lessons for 36 weeks during the school year. All groups showed a significant increase in IQ scores over the year. A small, significant difference in gain of 2.7 IQ points was reported when the results of the keyboard and Kodaly groups were combined and contrasted against the combined results for drama and no lessons. The combination of groups was not justified theoretically because the Kodaly method was presented as being very different from standard musical instruction. Reanalysis of the original uncombined groups produced results that were statistically insignificant and had small effect size values. The hypothesized unique effect of music lessons on IQ scores is still in need of demonstration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Pooling the controls negates the value of the drama group as a control for nonspecific factors. In a reanalysis, contrasts with the drama group were examined. They showed that the IQ of each music group following lessons did not differ significantly from those of the drama group. Moreover, increases in IQ for the music groups, separately and pooled, also did not differ significantly from those of the drama group.

Abstract = {A century of investigation into the role of the human frontal lobes in complex cognition, including language processing, has revealed several interesting but apparently contradictory findings. In particular, the results of numerous studies suggest that left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), which includes Broca's area, plays a direct role in sentence-level syntactic processing. In contrast, other brain-imaging and neuropsychological data indicate that LIFG is crucial for cognitive control--specifically, for overriding highly regularized, automatic processes, even when a task involves syntactically undemanding material (e.g., single words, a list of letters). We provide a unifying account of these findings, which emphasizes the importance of general cognitive control mechanisms for the syntactic processing of sentences. On the basis of a review of the neurocognitive and sentence-processing literatures, we defend the following three hypotheses: (1) LIFG is part of a network of frontal lobe subsystems that are generally responsible for the detection and resolution of incompatible stimulus representations; (2) the role of LIFG in sentence comprehension is to implement reanalysis in the face of misinterpretation; and (3) individual differences in cognitive control abilities in nonsyntactic tasks predict correlated variation in sentence-processing abilities pertaining to the recovery from misinterpretation.

Abstract = {This study reexamined the Charlotte School Safety Program, a school resource officer-delivered fear of crime reduction initiative. Initial evaluation of the program (Kenney & Watson, 1998) found increased perceptions of safety and reduced fear of crime for school youth, although structural properties of the study setting were not considered. Reanalysis of the data with a multivariate model generated qualifying findings that suggested the program may be less effective than previously determined. Minimal attention to environmental factors and the social setting reaffirmed the importance of addressing context in the criminological enterprise and the related issue of delivering empirically sound policy recommendations.

Abstract = {A decline has been found in the prevalence of disability among the older U.S. population during the 1980s and 1990s. One source of evidence for this decline is data from the National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS). This article investigates possible ambiguities in measuring disability using large-scale household surveys, illustrating the consequences of such problems with new analyses of NLTCS data. The reanalysis suggests a more gradual decline in disability than that found in prior research. The article also discusses three societal trends in areas other than health or functioning that might contribute to declines in disability levels: a reduced supply of informal care, changes in the technology of self-care, and changes in the definition and perception of both "ability" and "disability."

Abstract = {Background: The Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ), an eight-item self report scale (score range 0-24), was developed from the Social Functioning Schedule (SFS), a semi-structured interview which has been used primarily with non-psychotic patients and has good test-retest and inter-rater reliability as well as construct validity. The SFQ was developed following the need for a quick assessment of perceived social function. Aims: To give further details of old and new data sets from studies involving over 4000 subjects assessed with the SFQ illustrating its epidemiological and clinical associations. Method: New data were analysed from a national epidemiological study, a comparison of key-worker and subject versions of the SFQ, and reanalysis of data from three earlier clinical studies, of psychiatric emergencies, general practice psychiatric patients and those with recurrent psychotic illnesses. These data were examined further to determine their range, their relationship to other clinical measures, and change over time in clinical trials. Results: The population mean score in 4164 subjects was 4.6 and the data from all studies suggested that a score of 10 or more indicated poor social functioning. Those presenting as psychiatric emergencies had the poorest social function (mean 11.4) and psychiatric patients from general practice the best function (mean 7.7) of the clinical populations. The eight item scores had a normal distribution in psychiatric populations and a skewed one in a normal population; scores were relatively stable over the short (weeks) and long-term (months), and were high in the presence of acute mental health disturbance and personality disorder, giving support to the validity of the scale. The results from a UK sample of a randomly selected population specifically weighted for ethnic minorities showed similar social function across groups.

Abstract = {Background: Patient preferences and expert-generated clinical practice guidelines regarding treatment decisions may not be identical. The authors compared the thresholds for antithrombotic treatment from studies that determined or modeled the treatment preferences of patients with atrial fibrillation with recommendations from clinical practice guidelines. Methods: Methods included MEDLINE identification, systematic review, and pooling with some reanalysis of primary data from relevant studies. Results: Eight pertinent studies, including 890 patients, were identified. These studies used 3 methods (decision analysis, probability tradeoff, and decision aids) to determine or model patient preferences. All methods highlighted that the threshold above which warfarin was preferred over aspirin was highly variable. In 6 of 8 studies, patient preferences indicated that fewer patients would take warfarin compared to the recommendations of the guidelines. In general, at a stroke rate of 1% with aspirin, half of the participants would prefer warfarin, and at a rate of 2% with aspirin, two thirds would prefer warfarin. In 3 studies, warfarin must provide at least a 0.9% to 3.0% per year absolute reduction in stroke risk for patients to be willing to take it, corresponding to a stroke rate of 2% to 6% on aspirin. Conclusions: For patients with atrial fibrillation, treatment recommendations from clinical practice guidelines often differ from patient preferences, with substantial heterogeneity in their individual preferences. Since patient preferences can have a substantial impact on the clinical decision-making process, acknowledgment of their importance should be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines. Practicing physicians need to balance the patient preferences with the treatment recommendations from clinical practice guidelines. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Although many extant normative data sets for standardized neuropsychometric instruments feature adjustments for subject variables, there are reasons to believe that improvements in interpretive accuracy that result from such adjustments are less than optimal. In particular, several theoretical considerations suggest that years of formal education may be less closely related to test performances than is general intellectual functioning. In this first of four reanalyses of results from the Mayo Clinic's Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) databases, age-adjusted scores on the Boston Naming Test, the MAE Token Test, and the Judgment of Line Orientation Test were indeed found to be more strongly associated with Mayo Age-adjusted WAIS-R Full Scale IQ scores (rs = .608, .473, and .502, respectively) than with education (rs = .310, .306, and .236, respectively) for healthy older examinees (56-99 years). Consistent with the remarks of Dodrill (1997, 1999), these correlations generally decreased at higher levels of intelligence. The magnitude and pattern of such declines varied across the three tests, however, suggesting that IQ-test score associations must be empirically determined rather than assumed to be linear. Tables of Age- and IQ-Adjusted percentile equivalents of MOANS Age-adjusted BNT, Token Test, and JLO scaled scores are presented for eleven age ranges and seven IQ ranges. The article concludes with a discussion of factors that may underlie observed relations among age, intelligence, and neuropsychometric test performances.

Abstract = {The suggestion-imitation model of suicide posits that the number of observed suicides in the population will increase following reports in the media of individuals who died by suicide. Moreover, this imitative suicide phenomenon, which is an example of the Werther effect (Phillips, 1974), is believed to be greatest when the amount of media publicity surrounding a suicide is greatest. Although a number of studies have reported positive associations between mass media portrayals of suicide and actual suicide rates, these studies have been criticized on both methodological and statistical grounds. Perhaps the most central statistical concern is that these studies did not control for the positive correlation (i.e., dependency) between the expected and observed suicide rates before examining the impact of media publicity on the observed number of suicides. In light of this limitation, the present study re-analysed data from two classic articles but, unlike the original authors, the present inquiry examined residualized observed suicides as the dependent variable of interest. Results of the reanalyses indicated only partial support for the Werther effect. Directions for future research are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A literature search, supplemented by an expert survey and selected reanalyses of existing data from epidemiological studies was performed to determine the prevalence and associated burden of bipolar I and II disorder in EU countries. Only studies using established diagnostic instruments based on DSM-III-R or DSM-IV, or ICD-10 criteria were considered. Fourteen studies from a total of 10 countries were identified. The majority of studies reported 12-month estimates of approximately 1% (range 0.5-1.1%), with little evidence of a gender difference. The cumulative lifetime incidence (two prospective-longitudinal studies) is slightly higher (1.5-2%); and when the wider range of bipolar spectrum disorders is considered estimates increased to approximately 6%. Few studies have reported separate estimates for bipolar I and II disorders. Age of first onset of bipolar disorder is most frequently reported in late adolescence and early adulthood. A high degree of concurrent and sequential comorbidity with other mental disorders and physical illnesses is common. Most studies suggest equally high or even higher levels of impairments and disabilities of bipolar disorders as compared to major depression and schizophrenia. Few data are available on treatment and health care utilization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Epidemiological data on a wide range of mental disorders from community studies conducted in European countries are presented to determine the availability and consistency of prevalence, disability and treatment findings for the EU. Using a stepwise multimethod approach, 27 eligible studies with quite variable designs and methods including over 150,000 subjects from 16 European countries were identified. Prevalence: On the basis of meta-analytic techniques as well as on reanalyses of selected data sets, it is estimated that about 27% (equals 82.7 million; 95% CI: 78.5-87.1) of the adult EU population, 18-65 of age, is or has been affected by at least one mental disorder in the past 12 months. Taking into account the considerable degree of comorbidity (about one third had more than one disorder), the most frequent disorders are anxiety disorders, depressive, somatoform and substance dependence disorders. When taking into account design, sampling and other methodological differences between studies, little evidence seems to exist for considerable cultural or country variation. Disability and treatment: despite very divergent and fairly crude assessment strategies, the available data consistently demonstrate (a) an association of all mental disorders with a considerable disability burden in terms of number of work days lost (WLD) and (b) generally low utilization and treatment rates. Only 26% of all cases had any consultation with professional health care services, a finding suggesting a considerable degree of unmet need. The paper highlights considerable future research needs for coordinated EU studies across all disorders and age groups. As prevalence estimates could not simply be equated with defined treatment needs, such studies should determine the degree of met and unmet needs for services by taking into account severity, disability and comorbidity. These needs are most pronounced for the new EU member states as well as more generally for adolescent and older populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Overdependence on discrimination learning paradigms to assess the function of perirhinal cortex has complicated understanding of the cognitive role of this structure. Impairments in discrimination learning can result from at least two distinct causes: (a) failure to accurately apprehend and represent the relevant stimuli, or (b) failure to form and remember associations between stimulus representations and reward. Thus, the results of discrimination learning experiments do not readily differentiate deficits in perception from deficits in learning and memory. Here I describe studies that do dissociate learning and memory from perception and show that perirhinal cortex damage impairs learning and/or memory, but not perception. Reanalysis and reconsideration of other published data call into further question the hypothesis that the monkey perirhinal cortex plays a critical role in visual perception.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 18(2) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied (see record [rid]2012-15756-002[/rid]). It was found that the second author on the original paper, Roxana M. Gonzalez, falsified data in connection with certain research projects. Researchers not involved in this original project were engaged to repeat all analyses reported in the article, starting with the original, untainted data for the study. Based on this reanalysis, a corrected version of the article is now being published.] The authors examined the evolution of cognitive and emotional responses to terror risks for a nationally representative sample of Americans between late 2001 and late 2002. Respondents' risk judgments changed in ways consistent with their reported personal experiences. However, they did not recognize these changes, producing hindsight bias in memories for their judgments. An intensive debiasing procedure failed to restore a foresightful perspective. A fear-inducing manipulation increased risk estimates, whereas an anger-inducing manipulation reduced them-both in predictions (as previously observed) and in memories and judgments of past risks. Thus, priming emotions shaped not only perceptions of an abstract future but also perceptions of a concrete past. These results suggest how psychological research can help to ensure an informed public. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Past research on the influence of self-efficacy in training has provided mixed results. Key differences between studies pertain to whether past performance is operationalized as a residual variable or as an unadjusted variable and to the type of task used. In this study, the authors conducted and performed a reanalysis to examine the influence of self-efficacy using both operationalizations of past performance in 2 experimental tasks. Results indicate that, regardless of task version or type, self-efficacy predicted performance only when a residual measure of past performance was used, but not when past performance was unadjusted. However, when past performance was adjusted, the findings for self-efficacy were likely a statistical artifact. These results suggest that self-efficacy is a consequence rather than a cause of performance in training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Sitarenios (see record [rid]2003-02341-015[/rid]). Specifically, the values associated with the close-fit indices (normed fit index, Tucker-Lewis Index, and root-mean-square error of approximation) are inaccurate. A reanalysis of the Mayer et al. subscale intercorrelation matrix provided accurate values of the close-fit indices, which resulted in different evaluations of the models tested by J. D. Mayer et al. Contrary to J. D. Mayer et al., the 1-factor model and the 2-factor model did not provide good fit. Although the 4-factor model was still considered good fitting, the nonconstrained 4-factor model yielded a nonpositive definite matrix, which was interpreted to be due to the fact that two of the branch-level factors (Perceiving and Facilitating) were collinear, suggesting that a model with 4 factors was implausible.

Abstract = {A brief review of the history of pedagogical content knowledge reveals various definitions and conceptualizations of the construct, as well as some conceptual problems. A new conceptualization--teacher pedagogical constructions--is offered to address some of the problems associated with PCK. Seven assertions that comprise the new conceptualization are presented, explained and defended. These are: (1) PCK represents personal and private knowledge; (2) PCK is a collection of basic units called teacher pedagogical constructions; (3) teacher pedagogical constructions result mainly from planning, but also from the interactive and post-active phases of teaching; (4) pedagogical constructions result from an inventive process that is influenced by the interaction of knowledge and beliefs from different categories; (5) pedagogical constructions constitute both a generalized event-based and a story-based kind of memory; (6) pedagogical constructions are topic specific; and (7) pedagogical constructions are (or should ideally be) labeled in multiple interesting ways that connect them to other categories and subcategories of teacher knowledge and beliefs. The proposed definition results from a reconceptualization of the nature of PCK as originally proposed, taking the results of major later studies and conceptualizations of PCK into consideration, appropriating new ideas about the structure of memory, and undertaking a reanalysis and presentation of data from a previous study. The article calls for viewing PCK as neither a subcategory of subject matter (subject matter knowledge for teaching) nor as a general generic form of knowledge. It presents a view of PCK as a collection of teacher professional constructions, as a form of knowledge that preserves the planning and wisdom of practice that the teacher acquires when repeatedly teaching a certain topic. Viewing PCK as a collection of TPCs, more precisely defining it, clarifying its relations to other knowledge and beliefs entities, and speculating about its development should facilitate future investigations of PCK.

Abstract = {The inverted-U hypothesis has much empirical support in the field of experimental aesthetics. This hypothesis predicts that moderately complex art objects should be preferred over very simple or very complex art objects. Although it is tacitly believed that this hypothesis applies to experts, the literature does not contain any convincing studies that demonstrate this as fact. The present study addresses this issue. Professional jazz and bluegrass musicians rated the complexity of and their liking for short, but complete, jazz and bluegrass improvisations. Complexity and liking were operationalized by subjects' judgments on seven-point Likert-like scales. Regressing liking onto complexity did not reveal any evidence for an inverted-U relation for experts. Moreover, no relationship between liking and complexity was found for the jazz musicians; a negative relation was found for the bluegrass musicians, but only when listening to the bluegrass improvisations. Furthermore, by comparing the expert data with a reanalysis of nonexpert data collected in a previous, but identical study, we propose as a first approximation that musical expertise dissolves the relationship between liking and complexity.

Abstract = {Computer-based studies usually produce log files as raw data. These data cannot be analyzed adequately with conventional statistical software. The Chemnitz LogAnalyzer provides tools for quick and comfortable visualization and analyses of hypertext navigation behavior by individual users and for aggregated data. In addition, it supports analogous analyses of questionnaire data and reanalysis with respect to several predefined orders of nodes of the same hypertext. As an illustration of how to use the Chemnitz LogAnalyzer, we give an account of one study on learning with hypertext. Participants either searched for specific details or read a hypertext document to familiarize themselves with its content. The tool helped identify navigation strategies affected by these two processing goals and provided comparisons, for example, of processing times and visited sites. Altogether, the Chemnitz LogAnalyzer fills the gap between log files as raw data of Web-based studies and conventional statistical software.

Abstract = {A model for systematic changes in patterns of inter-individual variation in affective responses to physical activity of varying intensities is presented, as a conceptual alternative to the search for a global dose-response curve. It is theorized that trends towards universality will emerge in response to activities that are either generally adaptive, such as moderate walking, or generally maladaptive, such as strenuous running that requires anaerobic metabolism and precludes the maintenance of a physiological steady state. At the former intensity the dominant response will be pleasure, whereas at the latter intensity the dominant response will be displeasure. In contrast, affective responses will be highly variable, involving pleasure or displeasure, when the intensity of physical activity approximates the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, since activity performed at this intensity entails a trade-off between benefits and risks. Preliminary evidence in support of this model is presented, based on a reanalysis of data from a series of studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We report a reanalysis of data from a prior study describing the event history of quitting smoking aided by bupropion, using recurrent-event models to determine the effect of the drug on occurrence of lapses and recoveries from lapse (resumption of abstinence). Data were collected on 1,070 subjects across two similar double-blind randomized clinical trials of bupropion versus placebo and fitted with separate Cox regression models for lapse and recovery. Analyses were split using discrete time-varying covariates between the treatment (weeks 1-10) and follow-up phases (end of treatment to 12 months). Bupropion was associated with slower lapse during treatment for both sexes, and being female was associated with faster lapse across both phases. Drug did not affect time to recovery for males but was associated with faster recovery among females, allowing women to recover as quickly as men. High levels of nicotine dependence did not affect time to lapse but were associated with slower recovery from lapse across treatment and follow-up phases. During the treatment phase, higher levels of baseline depression symptoms had no effect on time to lapse but were associated with slower recovery from lapse. Results highlight the asymmetry in factors preventing lapse versus promoting recovery. Specifically, dependence, depression symptoms, and a sex × drug interaction were found to affect recovery but not lapse. Further research disentangling lapse and recovery events from summary abstinence measures is needed to help us develop interventions that take advantage of bupropion at its best and that compensate where it is weak.

Abstract = {Using restriction fragment length polymorphism and pyrosequencing methods, we genotyped two TNFA gene promoter SNPs (-G308A, -G238A) and analyzed the haplotype structure in 24 Canadian families of primarily Celtic origin. Our results demonstrate that after correction for multiple testing based on simulations of 10,000 replicates of unlinked/unassociated data, there is evidence for association (P=0.026) of a specific haplotype (-308A, -238G) with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders with a family-based trimmed haplotype linkage disequilibrium test (Trimhap). Stratifying the 22 families with genome scan data by TNFA promoter haplotypes followed by reanalysis of linkage to schizophrenia throughout the genome, we identified few loci that exhibit a considerable increase in LOD/HLOD scores. A locus on chromosome 1q44 (D1S1609) demonstrated a significant increase (P= 0.025) in LOD score from 0.15 to 3.01 with a broad definition of the schizophrenia phenotype and a dominant mode of inheritance. This result replicates a previously reported positive result of linkage of schizophrenia spectrum disorders to this area of the genome. We also illustrated that simulation studies are pivotal in evaluating the significance of results obtained with newer statistical methods, when multiple, but not independent, tests are performed, and when sample stratification is utilized to reduce the impact of heterogeneity or assess the interaction between loci.

Abstract = {Allowing students to choose the question(s) that they will answer from among several possible alternatives is often viewed as a mechanism for increasing fairness in certain types of assessments. The fairness of optional topic choice is not a universally accepted fact, however, and various studies have been done to assess this question. We examine an important class of experiments that we call C1-A, "choose one, answer all," designs, and point out an important problem that they face. We suggest two analytical methods that can be used to circumvent this problem. We illustrate our ideas using the data from Bridgeman et al. (1997). Our reanalysis of these data show: (a) that differential topic difficulty exists in real choice data, (b) that it affects naive analyses of such data and masks the effects, positive or negative, of examinee choice, (c) that in this study there is a measurable and positive effect of examinee choice that follows predicted patterns in most but not all cases, (d) that the beneficial strength of examinee choice varies from case to case, and (e) that while the benefits of choice in terms of average points scored on the essays are usually positive, there is a substantial amount of variation around these averages and it is not uncommon for "incorrect" choices to be associated with higher test performance.

Abstract = {Comments on Ovarian cancer and oral contraceptives: Collaborative reanalysis of data from 45 epidemiological studies including 23,257 women with ovarian cancer and 87,303 controls by the Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer (see record [rid]2008-01442-005[/rid]). The present authors contend that the study makes a major contribution to our understanding of the role of oral contraceptives in the causation or prevention of ovarian cancer. The researchers took advantage of the great statistical precision afforded by the combination of 45 studies, many of which were prospective cohorts. The Group calculates that use of oral contraceptives will eventually prevent 30,000 ovarian cancers per year. The notion that this unequivocal protective effect stems from the cumulative suppression of ovulatory cycles was strongly supported by the homogeneity of results across eras of use (as a proxy for oestrogen dose) and in the long-lasting protective effect after cessation of use. Reassuringly, case-control studies reproduced, on average, the same magnitude of protective effect found in cohort studies, which assuages concerns about recall bias. The Collaborative Group's new analysis provides useful insights into the association with ovarian-cancer histology. The protective effect was largely the same for epithelial and non-epithelial tumours, although there was less evidence that oral contraceptive use prevents mucinous ovarian cancer, which accounts for fewer than 15% of all incident cases. Oral contraceptives are not the only exogenous source hormones that might influence ovarian cancer risk in women. The Million-Women Study by the same group6 found that the mucinous ovarian cancer differed from other types after HRT. Use of HRT was associated with increased risk of serous and mixed-histology tumours, but not of mucinous tumours. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background Data on likely postdischarge outcomes are important for decision making about chronically critically ill patients. It seems reasonable to categorize outcomes into "better" or overall desirable states and "worse" or generally undesirable states. Survival, being at home, and being cognitively intact are commonly identified as important to quality of life and thus may be combined to describe composite outcome states. Objective To categorize postdischarge outcome states of chronically critically ill patients and identify predictors of better and worse states. Methods Reanalysis of data from a trial of a disease management program for chronically critically ill patients. Two composite outcomes were created: (1) the "better" outcome: no cognitive impairment at 2 months after discharge and alive and at home at 4 months (i.e., met all 3 criteria), and (2) the "worse" outcome: cognitive impairment 2 months after discharge, or death after discharge, or not living at home 4 months after discharge (i.e., met at least 1 of these criteria). Results Of 218 patients not requiring ventilatory support at discharge. 111 (50.9%) had a better outcome. Of 159 patients who were cognitively intact at discharge, 111 (69.8%) had a better outcome. Of the 39 patients who required ventilatory support at discharge, only 1 (3%) achieved the better outcome. Of 98 patients who were cognitively impaired at discharge, only 29 (30%) had the better outcome. Conclusion Need for mechanical ventilatory support and persistent cognitive impairment at discharge were associated with worse outcomes 4 months after discharge.

We agree with the commentators As Dr. Leucht et al. suggest, enrollment criteria that exclude those who have failed to respond to one study drug but not to others could bias the results of a clinical trial. Dr. Leucht et al. paraphrased us as stating "that most patients in CATIE were only moderately ill and relatively stable at baseline." However, it was reported that "these individuals varied widely in clinical severity." This range led us to examine the impact of severity, and we reported no significant interaction between baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores and the "stay versus switch" variable. Therefore, although we agree that switching the medications of stable patients may risk destabilization, our reanalysis of CATIE did not provide evidence to support their assertion concerning the interaction between switching medications and clinical status.

Abstract = {We report three eye-movement experiments that investigated whether alternative syntactic analyses compete during syntactic ambiguity resolution. Previous research (Traxler, Pickering, & Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, & Traxler, 2001) has shown that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated sentences, suggesting that competition does not explain processing difficulty. However, the disambiguation in these studies was delayed relative to the initial point of ambiguity, so they do not rule out models which claim that competition is very short-lasting. The current experiments show that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated sentences even when the disambiguation is immediate. Furthermore, globally ambiguous sentences are no harder to process than syntactically unambiguous sentences. We argue that the results are inconsistent with currently implemented constraint-based competition models, and support variable-choice reanalysis models such as the unrestricted race model.

Abstract = {German pronouns (erMALE/masculine, sieFEMALE/feminine) that refer to a person are determined by the biological gender (MALE/FEMALE) and/or syntactic gender (masculine/feminine) of the person. Pronouns (ermasculine, siefeminine) that refer to a thing are determined by the syntactic gender of this thing (Garten [garden]masculine, Tasche [hand-bag]feminine). The study aimed to investigate whether semantic integration, syntactic integration, or both are involved in establishing co-reference between pronoun and subject/antecedent in sentences. Here we focused on two event-related potential components: the SPS/P600, related to syntactic violation and reanalysis, and the N400 component, related to semantic integration problems. In one condition, a person was introduced as antecedent and later referred to by a pronoun, which either agreed in biological/syntactic gender or not (biological/syntactic gender violation). In a second condition, a thing was introduced as antecedent and the corresponding pronoun either agreed in syntactic gender or not (syntactic gender violation). Results at critical pronouns showed a P600 effect for incongruent compared with congruent pronouns in both conditions with a centro-parietal maximum. This effect was larger for the person compared to the thing condition. We interpreted this finding as reflecting a syntactic integration process that can be influenced by conceptual/semantic and syntactic information of the antecedent type. Furthermore, at the word following the pronoun, we observed an N400 for the thing but not for the person condition. We suggest, supported by the results of a control experiment, that this effect reflects continuous integration processes for things, whereas for persons the integration seems to be finished at pronoun position.

Abstract = {Mental health professionals can assist legal decision makers in cases of allegations of child sexual abuse by collecting data using forensic interviews, psychological testing, and record reviews, and by summarizing relevant findings from social science research. Significant controversy surrounds another key task performed by mental health professionals in most child sexual abuse evaluations, i.e., deciding whether or not to substantiate unconfirmed abuse allegations. The available evidence indicates that, on the whole, these substantiation decisions currently lack adequate psychometric reliability and validity: an analysis of empirical research findings leads to the conclusion that at least 24% of all of these decisions are either false positive or false negative errors. Surprisingly, a reanalysis of existing research also indicates that it may be possible to develop reliable, objective procedures to improve the consistency and quality of decision making in this domain. A preliminary, empirically-grounded procedure for making substantiation decisions is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The article argues that adult learning should be conceived both in terms of transformation of the adult's perspective and expansion of an entire community of practice. The article investigates two adult learning theories: Transformative learning theory (Mezirow) and the notion of expansive learning in activity theory (Engeström). While transformative learning theory conceives of learning and change in terms of critical self reflection, activity theory views learning and changes in terms of structural contradictions between or within systems mediated by dialogue and artefacts. The theories are situated by analysing examples of a horizontal learning environment versus a vertical learning environment. The examples derive from a reanalysis of two case studies. It is concluded that adult learning can be enhanced by developing communities of practices and that the adult's reflexive relation to self and world must be viewed in terms of expansion of social practice rather than subjective conditions for learning and self-reflection.

On the basis of this pattern, in conjunction with the emerging chronology of the earliest modern humans, the paleontological data indicate an assimilation model for modern human origins, in which the earliest modern humans emerged in eastern Africa, dispersed briefly into southwestern Asia, and then subsequently spread into the remainder of Africa and southern Asia, eventually into higher latitude Eurasia. The earliest modern humans outside of the core area of eastern Africa can be understood only if a variable degree of admixture with regional groups of late archaic humans occurred. Current and expected fossil and molecular data are unlikely to illuminate the degree of assimilation that took place in most regions of the Old World. However, the current chronological and phylogenetic framework provides the basis for ongoing investigation of the nature of this Late Pleistocene transitional period.

Abstract = {This paper experimentally examines the effects of the case-markings and the constraint on the assignments and the receptions of thematic roles in Japanese sentence processing. A self-paced reading experiment was carried out with syntactically well-controlled Japanese sentences including homonyms locally ambiguous between nouns and verbs. The results showed that the homonyms were preferably disambiguated as verbs. We interpret this disambiguation as the result of the application of the thematic constraint to the input items on the basis of the correspondence between the case-markings and the grammatical functions in Japanese. We further examined the effect of pragmatic plausibility on the interpretation of the homonyms by questionnaire, and claim that the thematic constraint is still the chief determinant for their disambiguation even with the possible plausibility effects. We also examined the effect of the verbal working memory capacity estimated by the Japanese Reading Span Test, and we demonstrate that a reader with a high score in the test comprehends sentences more accurately but spends relatively longer time for reanalyses than a reader with a low score. We discuss the relevances of our results to the parsing models for real-time Japanese sentence processing and to the studies of verbal working memory in English.

Abstract = {Coulson's (2001) analysis of humor as "frame-shifting' is extended to irony and compared to other current theories of humor and irony, including Giora's (2003) graded salience model. It is argued that the effects of humor and irony often depend on a subversive relation between the initial and alternative frames, which adds to both cognitive and social meaning; understanding these effects requires consideration of the expansion of common ground (Clark, 1996) and relevance effects (Sperber & Wilson, 1986) triggered by the shift from a culturally licensed to a subversive frame. Reanalysis of several examples from recent studies in the light of these approaches shows that humor and irony, like other forms of figurative language, can serve complex communicative, social, and cognitive objectives that justify according them a central place in communication-oriented theories of language use.

Abstract = {The present article seeks to provide an answer to the following question: according to which mechanisms may a pattern of word formation develop a new meaning? In order to keep the task to a manageable size only changes will be considered, the result of which stays within the same type of pattern (affixation, compounding, etc.). Hence, we will not discuss how affixes develop out of compounds or similar phenomena. The only scholar who, to the best of my knowledge, has addressed this issue in a systematic and comprehensive manner is Jaberg (1905), who claimed that semantic change in affixation is always the result of semantic change in individual words plus reanalysis. Our study will reveal, however, that, though this is in fact the most common scenario, there is yet another, hitherto ignored mechanism of semantic change in word formation where no lexical change is involved. This mechanism, which will be called "approximation," allows a mismatch to arise between a word formation pattern and a neologism formed according to it, if the distance is bridged by metaphor or metonymy.

Abstract = {This study examined the problem of interpreting effect sizes in single case research. Nine single case analytic techniques were applied to a convenience sample of 77 published interrupted time series (AB) datasets, and the results were compared by technique across the datasets. Reanalysis of the published data helped answer questions about the nine analytic techniques: their effect sizes, autocorrelation, statistical power, and intercorrelations. The study's findings were that few effect sizes matched Cohen's (1988) guidelines, and that effect sizes varied greatly by analytic technique. Four techniques showed adequate power for typical published data series. Autocorrelation was a sizeable problem in most analyses. In general, individual techniques performed so differently that users need technique-specific information to guide both selection of an analytic technique and interpretation of its results.

Abstract = {Several models have been proposed for the measurement of cognitive processes in source monitoring. They are specified within the statistical framework of multinomial processing tree models and differ in their assumptions on the storage and retrieval of multidimensional source information. In the present article, a hierarchical relationship is demonstrated between multinomial models for crossed source information (Meiser & Bröder, 2002), for partial source memory (Dodson, Holland, & Shimamura, 1998) and for several sources (Batchelder, Hu, & Riefer, 1994). The hierarchical relationship allows model comparisons and facilitates the specification of identifiability conditions. Conditions for global identifiability are discussed, and model comparisons are illustrated by reanalyses and by a new experiment on the storage and retrieval of multidimensional source information.

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper offers a reanalysis or "re-view" of a celebrated tale of corporate transformation - the turnaround of Sears, Roebuck and Company - which was discussed in the Harvard Business Review. Noting that "contextual" and "processual" attempts to revise the tale of Sears and its transformation would tend to exchange one monological rendering for another, albeit more critical account, the paper "re-views" the case in an attempt to make space for perspectives and narratives normally edited out of narratives of change management Design/methodology/approach: Building upon a critical review of the literature concerned with organizational storytelling the paper "re-views" the Harvard rendering of the Sears case as an epic tale. The paper then supplements this epic rendering of the Sears case with another two accounts of the case, which recast and review the tale first as a tragedy and then as a comedy. Findings: The paper reveals the polysemic nature of organization and change and suggests the need for approaches to the narration of change that can give voice to perspectives denied by both celebratory and critical accounts of change management Originality/value: The paper offers an innovative "re-view" of a celebrated account of change management and invites the reader to make room for voices and perspectives normally lost within narratives of change.

@article{2005-02393-00120050101,
Abstract = {Post hoc analyses of pooled results from 11 randomised controlled trials of risperidone and olanzapine in elderly dementia subjects revealed an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events compared with placebo. Reanalysis of the risperidone trials suggests that some of the increased incidence may be accounted for by nonspecific events that were not strokes. Large observational administrative health database studies appear to confirm that risperidone and olanzapine are not associated with an increased risk of stroke in elderly patients compared with typical antipsychotics or untreated dementia patients. A larger number of subjects with vascular and mixed dementias were included in the risperidone studies compared with the olanzapine studies, which likely accounts for the increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in the risperidone trials compared with the olanzapine studies. Potential mechanisms proposed to explain an association between atypical antipsychotics and cerebrovascular adverse events include thromboembolic effects, cardiovascular effects (e.g. orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias), excessive sedation resulting in dehydration and haemoconcentration, and hyperprolactinaemia. However, there is little evidence to support these hypothesised mechanisms at present. The association between atypical antipsychotics and cerebrovascular adverse events requires further clarification. At the present time, this association is another factor that clinicians should consider when weighing the risks and benefits of treating behavioural and psychological disturbances in elderly dementia patients.

Boyle (2005; see record [rid]2004-22408-002[/rid]) that working memory capacity (WMC) is not isomorphic with general fluid intelligence (Gf) or reasoning ability. However, the WMC and Gf/reasoning constructs are more strongly associated than Ackerman et al. (2005) indicate, particularly when considering the outcomes of latent-variable studies. The authors' reanalysis of 14 such data sets from 10 published studies, representing more than 3,100 young-adult subjects, suggests a strong correlation between WMC and Gf/reasoning factors (median r = .72), indicating that the WMC and Gf constructs share approximately 50% of their variance. This comment also clarifies the authors' "executive attention" view of WMC, it demonstrates that WMC has greater discriminant validity than Ackerman et al. (2005) implied, and it suggests some future directions and challenges for the scientific study of the convergence of WMC, attention control, and intelligence.

Abstract = {On the basis of a meta-analysis of pairwise correlations between working memory tasks and cognitive ability measures, P. L. Ackerman, M. E. Beier, and M. O. Boyle (2005; see record [rid]2004-22408-002[/rid]) claimed that working memory capacity (WMC) shares less than 25% of its variance with general intelligence (g) and with reasoning ability. In this comment, the authors argue that this is an underestimation because of several methodological shortcomings and biases. A reanalysis of the data reported in Ackerman et al. using the correct statistical procedures demonstrates that g and WMC are very highly correlated. On a conceptual level, the authors point out that WMC should be regarded as an explanatory construct for intellectual abilities. Theories of working memory do not claim that WMC is isomorphic with intelligence factors but that it is a very strong predictor of reasoning ability and also predicts general fluid intelligence and g.

Abstract = {This article disputes the view that systems of gender identity are so extraordinarily variable cross-culturally as to suggest that they are wholly culturally constructed, and, therefore, not open to universal explanation. Instead, we argue, these systems are underlain by a universal unresolved tension between being masculine and being feminine. This tension can best be understood in terms of the psychoanalytic concept of splitting, as developed by Melanie Klein and extended by feminist theorists Nancy Chodorow and Jessica Benjamin. We illustrate our argument with a detailed reanalysis of ethnographic material, published by Anna Meigs, on the Hua of Papua New Guinea. Our analysis challenges anthropologist Henrietta Moore's construal of the Hua case as evidence against the cross-cultural applicability of Western categories of gender identity.

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that phonotactic probability (the likelihood of occurrence of a sound sequence) and neighborhood density (the number of words phonologically similar to a given word) influence spoken language processing and acquisition across the lifespan in both normal and clinical populations. The majority of research in this area has tended to focus on controlled laboratory studies rather than naturalistic data such as spontaneous speech samples or elicited probes. One difficulty in applying current measures of phonotactic probability and neighborhood density to more naturalistic samples is the significant correlation between these variables and word length. This study examines several alternative transformations of phonotactic probability and neighborhood density as a means of reducing or eliminating this correlation with word length. Computational analyses of the words in a large database and reanalysis of archival data supported the use of z scores for the analysis of phonotactic probability as a continuous variable and the use of median transformation scores for the analysis of phonotactic probability as a dichotomous variable. Neighborhood density results were less clear with the conclusion that analysis of neighborhood density as a continuous variable warrants further investigation to differentiate the utility of z scores in comparison to median transformation scores. Furthermore, balanced dichotomous coding of neighborhood density was difficult to achieve, suggesting that analysis of neighborhood density as a dichotomous variable should be approached with caution. Recommendations for future application and analyses are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Using an IAT measure in millisecond-difference score format, they concluded that the IAT was confounded with general cognitive ability. A reanalysis of these data using the D measure (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003) eliminated the speed of responding confound, although it did not eliminate the correlation between the control and racism IATs. The study was replicated and the two correlations, paralleling those in the original study, emerged for the millisecond- difference score. However, both were reduced to nonsignificance by use of the D measure. These findings are consistent with other recent studies (Mierke & Klauer, 2003) that document the protection afforded by D against cognitive skill confounds.

Conceptualizing psychosis as involving difficulties in establishing psychological boundaries, the authors hypothesized that dependency has a greater disruptive effect on recovery than self-criticism. Results of a reanalysis of longitudinal data (N = 76) of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders during recovery from acute psychosis were consistent with this hypothesis: Dependency predicted depressive and negative symptoms, and, under low efficacy, perceived loss of independence and insight into the presence of the illness. These findings elucidate the central role of interpersonal relatedness as a foundation for self-definition in recovery from psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The understanding of the adult proficiency in recognizing and extracting information from faces is still limited despite the number of studies over the last decade. Our knowledge on the development of these capacities is even more restricted, as only a handful of such studies exist. Here we present a combined reanalysis of four ERP studies in children from 4 to 15 years of age and adults (n = 424, across the studies), which investigated face processing in implicit and explicit tasks. We restricted these analyses to what was common across studies: early ERP components and upright face processing across all four studies and the inversion effect, investigated in three of the studies. These data demonstrated that processing faces implicates very rapid neural activity, even in young children--at the P1 component--with protracted age-related change in both P1 and N170, that were sensitive to the different task demands. Inversion produced latency and amplitude effects on the P1 from the youngest group, but on N170 only starting in mid childhood. These developmental data suggest that there are functionally different sources of the P1 and N170, related to the processing of different aspects of faces.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An addendum for this article was reported in Vol 19(1) of Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (see record [rid]2007-01265-016[/rid]). The EEG data presented by Marshall, Fox, and The BEIP Core Group were collected in Bucharest, Romania between April 2001 and November 2003. It was recently discovered that over a period of 4 months in 2001, the channel for the right mastoid electrode was mistakenly switched with the channel for the right occipital electrode. The purpose of this addendum is to briefly present the key similarities and differences between the originally reported findings and the results of the reanalysis.] Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from a sample of institutionalized infants and young children in Bucharest, Romania, and were compared with EEG data from age-matched children from the local community who had never been institutionalized and who were living with their families in the Bucharest area. Compared with the never-institutionalized group, the institutionalized group showed a pattern of increased low-frequency (theta) power in posterior scalp regions and decreased high-frequency (alpha and beta) power, particularly at frontal and temporal electrode sites. This finding is consistent with EEG studies of children facing environmental adversity and children with learning disorders. The institutionalized group also showed less marked hemispheric EEG asymmetries than the never-institutionalized group, particularly in the temporal region. The results are discussed in the context of two models: that the pattern of EEG in the institutionalized children reflects a maturational lag in nervous system development, or that it reflects tonic cortical hypoactivation.

Abstract = {Background: Two recent reanalyses of epidemiologic studies found that adding a clinical significance criterion reduced disorder prevalence. Patients presenting for clinical care are usually distressed or impaired by their symptoms; thus, the DSM-IV clinical significance criterion might have little impact on diagnosis in clinical practice. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examine the impact of the DSM-IV clinical significance criterion on diagnostic frequencies of depressive and anxiety disorders in psychiatric outpatients. Method: 1500 psychiatric outpatients were evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. We determined the percentage of patients who met symptom criteria but did not meet the DSM-IV clinical significance criterion for major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia, specific phobia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Results: No patient who met the symptom criteria for current major depressive disorder or PTSD failed to meet the clinical significance criterion. Less than 2% of patients meeting the symptom criteria for current GAD did not meet the clinical significance criterion. There was variability among the remaining anxiety disorders in the percentage of symptomatic patients who met the clinical significance criterion. Conclusion: In psychiatric patients, the clinical significance criterion had little impact on diagnosing major depressive disorder, GAD, and PTSD, disorders that are defined, in part, by disruptions of daily regulatory domains such as sleep, appetite, energy, and concentration. In contrast, the clinical significance criterion had a greater impact in determining whether phobic fears, obsessive thoughts, and panic attacks were sufficiently distressing or impairing to qualify for disorder status.

Abstract = {Associations between parenting style and depressive symptomatology in a community sample of young adolescents (N=2596) were investigated using self-report measures including the Parental Bonding Instrument and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Specifically, the 25-item 2-factor and 3-factor models by Parker et al. (1979), Kendler's (1996) 16-item 3-factor model, and Parker's (1983) quadrant model for the Parental Bonding Instrument were compared. Data analysis included analysis of variance and logistic regression. Reanalysis of Parker's original scale indicates that overprotection is composed of separate factors: intrusiveness (at the individual level) and restrictiveness (in the social context). All models reveal significant independent contributions from paternal care, maternal care, and maternal overprotection (2-factor) or intrusiveness (3-factor) to moderate and serious depressive symptomatology, controlling for sex and family living arrangement. Additive rather than multiplicative interactions between care and overprotection were found. Regardless of the level of parental care and affection, clinicians should note that maternal intrusiveness is strongly associated with adverse psychosocial health in young adolescents.

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to elucidate the neural underpinning of Chinese idiom comprehension with spatiotemporal patterns of ERP. Thirteen subjects were required to decide whether the last character of each viewed Chinese four-character idiom was correct or not. Fuzzy c-means algorithm based on shape similarity was applied to segmenting spatiotemporal patterns of ERP. Statistical parametric map of t-statistic (SPM(t)) was performed after realignment according to the referential frame provided by fuzzy clustering in order to overcome temporal mismatch. Within 540 ms post-stimulus onset, the spatiotemporal patterns of ERP under both conditions could be segmented into 7 stages optimally and both share the first four microstates with variant membership functions and durations. SPM(t) presented significant differences in multiple regions in 3 stages: (1) during 120-150 ms, the early right hemispheric negativities (ERHN) in both frontal and temporoparietal areas were likely to reflect both initial syntactic processing and visual word-form mismatch; (2) during 320-380 ms (the N400 stage), negative deflections in left frontal, left anterior temporal, centrofrontal regions might coordinate and integrate both syntactic and semantic analysis in extensive right hemisphere; (3) during 480-540 ms (the P600 stage), positive deflections in left temporoparietal and occipital regions seemed to reflect the reanalysis and the integration of word meanings to obtain the over all meaning of idioms. Our study has implicated the brain mechanism of language comprehension common to alphabetic language as well as that specialized in logographic language.

Abstract = {Alcohol 'cognitions' were explored using an implicit methodology [Stacy, Leigh and Weingardt, 1994]. In Study 1, an Associations Questionnaire was developed with young adult undergraduates (median = 20 years) comprising culturally available (i.e., high-frequency occurrence) and idiosyncratic (i.e., low-frequency occurrence) positive and negative alcohol consumption outcomes and positive and negative outcomes of behaviors-other-than-alcohol consumption. In Study 2, the relationship was explored between the alcohol consumption of young adult undergraduates (median age= 19 years) and implicit alcohol-related associations made through the Associations Questionnaire. A significant positive relationship was found between consumption and positive and negative culturally available (experimental) outcomes but not for the other two types of (control) outcome. In Study 3, the relationship between alcohol consumption and alcohol-related associations was explored in mature adults (median = 45 years) with many more years' drinking experience. The results of Study 1 were replicated except that a significant positive relationship between consumption and some control outcomes was now found--e.g., negative outcomes of what where hitherto behaviors-other-than-alcohol consumption. In Study 4, however, using the same techniques that were used to develop the Associations Questionnaire in Study 1, an extended set of negative alcohol consumption outcomes was found in mature adults (median = 44 years) that included a proportion of the negative outcomes of behaviors-other-than-alcohol consumption that had served as controls in Studies 2 and 3. A reanalysis of the data from Study 3, with such items removed from the controls and designated 'new' negative alcohol consumption outcomes, showed a positive relationship between consumption and implicit alcohol-related associations made through these 'new' items of the Associations Questionnaire. The changing profile of associations with negative outcomes of consumption is discussed and related to negative expectancy research and drinking restraint.

Abstract = {Disfluencies include editing terms such as uh and um as well as repeats and revisions. Little is known about how disfluencies are processed, and there has been next to no research focused on the way that disfluencies affect structure-building operations during comprehension. We review major findings from both computational linguistics and psycholinguistics, and then we summarize the results of our own work which centers on how the parser behaves when it encounters a disfluency. We describe some new research showing that information associated with misarticulated verbs lingers, and which adds to the large body of data on the critical influence of verb argument structures on sentence comprehension. The paper also presents a model of disfluency processing. The parser uses a Tree Adjoining Grammar to build phrase structure. In this approach, filled and unfilled pauses affect the timing of Substitution operations. Repairs and corrections are handled by a mechanism we term "Overlay," which allows the parser to overwrite an undesired tree with the appropriate, correct tree. This model of disfluency processing highlights the need for the parser to sometimes coordinate the mechanisms that perform garden-path reanalysis with those that do disfluency repair. The research program as a whole demonstrates that it is possible to study disfluencies systematically and to learn how the parser handles filler material and mistakes. It also showcases the power of Tree Adjoining Grammars, a formalism developed by Aravind Joshi which has yielded results in many different areas of linguistics and cognitive science.

Abstract = {We present an event-related brain potential (ERP) study demonstrating that high and low span readers show qualitatively different brain responses in the comprehension of ambiguous and complex linguistic stimuli. During the processing of ambiguous German sentences, low span readers showed a broadly distributed, sustained positivity, whereas high span participants showed a shorter, topographically more focused negativity. Qualitatively similar effects were observable in response to (complex) object-initial sentences. Additionally, a neural effect reflecting reanalysis in sentences disambiguated in a dispreferred way (P600) was observable only for high span readers, while the low span group showed an N400-like response. These neurophysiological findings support the notion that individual working memory capacity as measured by the reading span test influences sentence processing mechanisms and are compatible with the hypothesis that low span readers cannot effectively inhibit dispreferred readings.

Abstract = {Objective: This article presents a reanalysis of an earlier study that reported a nonsignificant relation between the 50-item Cook-Medley Hostility Scale (CMHS) and survival in a sample of coronary patients. Since publication of those results, there have been significant developments in the measurement of hostility that suggest that an abbreviated scale may be a better predictor of health outcomes. This study examined the ability of the total CMHS and an abbreviated form of the CMHS (ACM) to predict survival in a sample of patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD) with increased statistical power. Methods: Nine hundred thirty-six patients (83% were male; mean age = 51.48) with CAD who were followed for an average of 14.9 years. The ACM consisted of the combination of the cynicism, hostile attribution, hostile affect, and aggressive responding subscales that were identified in an earlier study (Barefoot et al. [1989]) by a rational analysis of the item content. The relation between hostility and survival was examined with Cox proportional hazard models (hazard ratios [HRs] based on a two standard deviation difference). Results: Controlling for disease severity, the ACM was a significant predictor for both CHD mortality (HR = 1.33, p < .009) and total mortality (HR = 1.28, p < .02). The total CMHS was only a marginally significant predictor of either outcome (p values < 0.06). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that hostility is associated with poorer survival in CAD patients, and it may be possible to refine measures of hostility in order to improve prediction of health outcomes.

Abstract = {Multicollinearity is a well-known general problem, but it also seriously threatens valid interpretations in structural equation models. Illustrating this problem, J. Pietsch, R. Walker, and E. Chapman (2003) found paths leading to achievement were apparently much larger for self-efficacy (.55) than self-concept (-.05), suggesting--erroneously, as the authors' reanalysis shows--that self-efficacy was a better predictor of achievement. However, because standard errors for these two paths were so huge (.25) thanks to the extremely high correlation between self-concept and self-efficacy (r = .93), interpretations were problematic. In a model comparison approach to this multicollinearity problem, constraining these two paths to be equal provided a better, more parsimonious fit to the data and also substantially reduced the standard errors (from .25 to .03).

Abstract = {Objectives: Patients undergoing major surgery often require several days of postoperative analgesia. However, few data exist on the longitudinal course of postoperative pain and the psychometric properties of pain assessment tools used in this setting. Our objective was to validate use of the modified Brief Pain Inventory through reanalysis of pain data from a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of analgesia after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Methods: Four hundred sixty-two patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery via median sternotomy were administered a shortened form of the original Brief Pain Inventory that contained 3 severity and 5 interference items. Additionally, patients were presented with a single-item measure of procedure-specific pain. Daily pain and interference ratings were available from days 4 to 14 postoperatively. We performed factor analysis to evaluate the consistency with which the modified Brief Pain Inventory items loaded on 2 separate factors corresponding to the original Brief Pain Inventory's pain severity and pain interference subscales. We calculated 2 reliability measures, internal consistency and test-retest reliability, for each subscale. Results: The modified Brief Pain Inventory consistently measured 2 underlying constructs, severity and interference, with Cronbach alphas of 0.85 or greater for the 2 Brief Pain Inventory scales, and test-retest stability coefficients ranging from 0.58 to 0.95 for each pair of consecutive assessment periods. The procedure-specific pain question showed substantial overlap with a general measure of pain severity, suggesting concurrent validity. Discussion: The modified Brief Pain Inventory was stable and valid over the assessment period, suggesting that it can be used during the subacute postoperative period to assess postoperative pain among patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Abstract = {There is evidence showing that HPA axis responses to pharmacological provocation depend on time of day with larger cortisol responses in the afternoon and evening compared to the morning hours. However, it is still unknown whether HPA axis responses to psychological stress are affected by time of day and whether they can be assessed with equal reliability in the morning and afternoon, respectively. The present reanalysis is based on five independent studies conducted in the same laboratory by Kirschbaum et al. (1999); Kudielka et al. (1998, 1999, 2000) and Schommer et al. (2003). All subjects were confronted with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) either in the morning or in the afternoon. The total sample consisted of 180 adults with 115 younger (49 females, 66 males) and 65 older adults (32 females, 33 males). All ANCOVA results controlled for possible age and gender effects. Stress-related free salivary cortisol, total plasma cortisol and ACTH net increases did not differ according to time of day (all p=n.s.). However, as expected pre-stress free salivary and total plasma cortisol levels differed significantly between the morning and afternoon group (both p<0.005), leading to a significantly higher free cortisol area under the curve (ADC) in the morning (p=0.02). Taken together, these observations suggest that the adrenal glands may be more sensitive to ACTH in the morning. Additionally, higher basal salivary cortisol levels were related to a lower stress-related net increase in salivary cortisol (p=0.02), total plasma cortisol (p<0.0001), and marginally ACTH (p=0.09). Stress-related heart rate increases did not differ between groups (p=n.s.). The finding that the TSST-induced mood change was differentially affected by time of day requires further exploration. We conclude that comparable HPA axis and heart rate stress responses to psychosocial stress can be measured in the morning and afternoon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 29(8) of Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology (see record [rid]2007-18507-013[/rid]). The authors recently discovered that there were errors in the data that were reported in the original article. Specifically, 37 cases were accidentally duplicated across the two samples used in the cross-validation analyses conducted in this study. The duplication occurred as a result of merging two databases with overlapping data to form the samples used in the study in question. While reanalysis of corrected data did not change the pattern of results, the authors wish to withdraw the paper from the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. The authors have undertaken an independent audit of their entire database to ensure that the same or similar errors (or any other errors) do not exist in the data relevant to other studies conducted by their research group and published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology and in other journals.] This study aimed to replicate and cross-validate the Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) for diagnosing mild TBI (mTBI). One hundred (81 male, 19 female) cases of mTBI and 35 (23 male and 12 female) cases of orthopaedic injuries were tested within 24 hr of injury. Double cross-validation was used to examine whether total RSC scores obtained in the current sample, generalised to one previously reported. In the new sample, mTBI patients answered fewer orientation questions, recalled fewer words on the learning trial and after a delay, judged fewer sentences in 2 min, and completed fewer symbols in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test than orthopaedic controls. The formulae and cut-offs developed on the original and new samples produced similar sensitivity and overall correct classification rates. Inclusion of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test performance of the new sample improved the sensitivity (80.2%) and specificity (82.6%) in males. It did not improve the correct classification rate in females, which was 89.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity before the inclusion of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Taken together, these results indicate that a combined score on this 12-min screen yields a measure of level of brain impairment up to 24 hr after mTBI.

The study involved 157 children, age 9-12 years, who were randomly assigned to a parenting program or a literature control condition. Program effects to reduce posttest internalizing problems were mediated through improvement in mother-child relationship quality. Program effects to reduce externalizing problems at posttest and 6 months were mediated through improvement in posttest parental methods of discipline and mother-child relationship quality. The study also describes a new methodology to test mediation of Program x Baseline Status interactions. Analyses demonstrate mediation effects primarily for children who began the program with poorer scores on discipline, mother-child relationship quality, and externalizing problems.

Abstract = {This paper investigates the processing of long-distance filler-gap dependencies in Japanese, a strongly head-final language. Two self-paced reading experiments and one sentence completion study show that Japanese readers associate a fronted wh-phrase with the most deeply embedded clause of a multi-clause sentence. Experiment 1 demonstrates this using evidence that readers expect to encounter a scope-marking affix on the verb of an embedded clause in wh-fronting constructions. Experiment 2 shows that the wh-phrase is already associated with the embedded clause before the embedded verb is processed, based on a Japanese counterpart of the Filled Gap Effect (Stowe, 1986). Experiment 3 corroborates these findings in a sentence completion study. These findings clarify the factors responsible for 'active filler' effects in processing long-distance dependencies (Grain & Fodor, 1985; Fodor, 1978; Frazier & Clifton, 1989; Stowe, 1986) in ways not possible in head-initial languages. The results provide evidence that the processing of filler-gap dependencies is driven by the need to satisfy thematic role requirements of the fronted phrase, rather than by the need to create a gap as soon as possible. The paper also discusses implications of these findings for theories of reanalysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Only a few studies have focussed on the consistency of sexual selection patterns in space and time. One such case is the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), for which studies in Germany in 1981-1982 and Sweden in 1987-1991 strongly suggested that the size of a male's song repertoire was the target of mate choice and sexual selection. Studying the same German population once again in 1994-2000, we investigated the consistency of these patterns over time as well as between populations. Our reanalysis of the data from 1981-1982 shows that male repertoire size was positively correlated with male pairing success (harem size) and with clutch size (adjusted for seasonal effects), whereas no such correlations were found during 1994-2000 in the same population. We suggest that the earlier correlations were probably caused indirectly by covariation with territory quality, and that a decline in population size has changed the role of territory quality. In the Swedish population, an earlier study found a striking correlation between the size of a male's repertoire and the viability of its offspring, suggesting good-gene effects. In contrast, we found no such correlation in the German population, neither in 1981-1982 nor in 1994-2000. We conclude that repertoire size does not seem to be a very reliable indicator of variation in male quality. Interestingly, the analysis of data from 1994-2000 showed that male pairing success was strongly correlated with measures of strophe length and immediate versatility, traits that have been found to reflect male longevity. Future studies will have to show whether these performance-related traits are more powerful indicators of male quality than is repertoire size.

One socialization hypothesis overlooked by Stark was that Islam as a religion might have been developed, in a small part, as a response to the gender differential observed in earlier religions. Reanalysis of Stark's 2002 data indicates that Islamic nations were more likely to yield smaller gender differences on religious questions, although the effect ranged from p<.06 to a significant p<.005, depending on the method of analysis.

Abstract = {Roediger, Watson, McDermott, and Gallo (2001) reported a multiple regression analysis of the variables that predicted rates of false recall and recognition across lists in the Deese/Roediger-McDermott paradigm. They concluded that false recollection was predictable from the backward associative strength of critical words and list words and the veridical recall level of list words, with no independent contribution of frequency, concreteness, or length of critical words. A reanalysis of their data shows that critical word length does contribute to false recognition when it is measured relative to the length of other words in the list. Relative word length in the form of an unsigned z-score has a larger correlation with false recognition than any of the variables used by Roediger et al. and is also independently predictive of false recognition. This relationship was confirmed by the results of two recognition experiments in which false positives were significantly less frequent for words of lengths that never occurred in a studied list than for words of lengths that did occur in the study list.

Abstract = {Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid derived from the root bark of the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga and it has been used for many years as a medicinal and ceremonial agent in West Central Africa. Furthermore, both anecdotal observations and recent studies suggest that ibogaine alleviates withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug cravings. Although ibogaine articles typically include information bearing on the duration of drug abstinence following treatment, little if any attention is given to the psychological and environmental factors that might facilitate a positive treatment outcome. Hence, a major purpose of the present review is to suggest a number of theory-driven, pretreatment and posttreatment recommendations that have good potential for enhancing ibogaine's effectiveness. The second major purpose of this review is to demonstrate, through a reanalysis of previously published results, the utility of conducting successive model fitting analyses on ibogaine treatment data. Such analyses are useful for determining both the strength and form of the association between pre-ibogaine treatment variables and post-ibogaine treatment outcomes. Finally, in order to facilitate future quantitative reviews, the authors recommend that a minimum set of patient- and treatment-related variables be included in all ibogaine publications involving human participants.

Abstract = {Examined whether biallelic variation in the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) acts analogously to modulate a previously described association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CNS serotonergic function. The 5-HTTLPR was genotyped in 139 adult men and women who were administered a standard neuroendocrine challenge to assess central serotonergic responsivity. Socio-economic status was estimated from reported income and years of education. Hierarchical linear regression showed serotonergic responsivity to be predicted by the interaction of 5-HTTLPR genotype and SES. Individuals of lower income and less education had lower peak PRL concentrations following administration of fenfluramine than did subjects ranking higher on these dimensions, but only among persons possessing at least one 5-HTTLPR short allele. Within genotype, SES covaried moderately with the PRL response to fenfluramine among subjects who were homozygous for the short allele. Findings were comparable for men and women and persisted on reanalysis restricted to persons without current Axis I psychopathology. We conclude that allelic variation at 5-HTTLPR moderates the influence of social position on CNS serotonergic responsivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article reports three studies that examine the personality and behavioral correlates of the Intercultural Adjustment Potential Scale (ICAPS), which measures constructs empirically related to adjustment, including emotion regulation, openness, flexibility, and critical thinking. Study 1 involved a reanalysis of previously published data and examined the convergent, concurrent predictive, and incremental validities of these dimensions to predict adjustment. Study 2 replicated Study 1 with different measures. The findings from both studies provided strong evidence for the validity of the ICAPS scales to predict adjustment above and beyond that already predicted by personality. In Study 3 participants completed the ICAPS, a nonverbal emotion recognition task, and a behavioral task related to adjustment. The ICAPS predicted actual behaviors above and beyond that already predicted by emotion recognition. These results are discussed in terms of a possible universal set of psychological skills necessary for life adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The subject of this case-report is the life-history, nosogenesis and history of compensation claims of a 64-years old Sinti-woman, who survived Nazi-persecution and WWII as a child. She and her mother spent 3 years in a concentration camp. At the end of the war she witnessed her mother's death. Her life is characterised by psychosomatic symptoms, disorders of psychosexual development, including infertility, and a chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The non-treated course of the Holocaust survivor syndrome, described by Niederland, which was mostly denied in Germany, could be now shown by detailled exploration and the reanalysis of former expert reports of her symptoms. Furthermore, this case report presents the internationally described characteristics of long-term effects in children that have survived the Holocaust. These symptoms are typical of cases that were not been treated throughout life. The former lack of acceptance in Germany of these long-term effects has--like in this and other cases--led to development into a chronic disorder.

Abstract = {Three classes of evidence demonstrate the existence of life scripts, or culturally shared representations of the timing of major transitional life events. First, a reanalysis of earlier studies on age norms shows an increase in the number of transitional events between the ages of 15 and 30 years, and these events are associated with narrower age ranges and more positive emotion than events outside this period. Second, 1,485 Danes estimated how old hypothetical centenarians were when they had been happiest, saddest, most afraid, most in love, and had their most important and most traumatic experiences. Only the number of positive events showed an increase between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Third, undergraduates generated seven important events that were likely to occur in the life of a newborn. Pleasantness and whether events were expected to occur between the ages of 15 and 30 years predicted how frequently events were recorded. Life scripts provide an alternative explanation of the reminiscence bump. Emphasis is on culture, not individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Two procedures were used to explore the effects of semantic and grammatical gender on the recognition and processing of Bulgarian nouns, in relation to other factors that are known to affect lexical access. This study in a three-gender language was modeled on previous work in Italian, a two-gender language (Bates, Devescovi, Pizzamiglio, D'Amico, & Hernandez, 1995). Words were presented auditorily in randomized lists in two tasks: (1) repeat the word as quickly as possible and (2) determine the grammatical gender of the noun as soon as possible and indicate the decision by pressing a button. Reaction times in both tasks were influenced by phonological factors, word frequency, and irregularity of gender marking, but semantic and grammatical gender affected only gender monitoring. The significant contribution of semantic gender to processing in Bulgarian contrasts with previous findings for Italian. Also, we obtained an interaction between sex of the subject and noun gender, reflecting a bias toward one's own grammatical gender "counterpart" (especially for females). Reanalysis of the prior study in Italian showed a similar interaction but confirmed no effects of the semantic gender of the noun, suggesting that these two natural gender effects can dissociate. Possible reasons for cross-linguistic differences are discussed, with implications for comparative studies of gender and lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {At the centenary of Spearman's seminal 1904 article, his general intelligence hypothesis remains one of the most influential in psychology. Less well known is the article's other hypothesis that there is "a correspondence between what may provisionally be called 'General Discrimination' and 'General Intelligence' which works out with great approximation to one or absoluteness" (Spearman, 1904, p. 284). Studies that do not find high correlations between psychometric intelligence and single sensory discrimination tests do not falsify this hypothesis. This study is the first directly to address Spearman's general intelligence-general sensory discrimination hypothesis. It attempts to replicate his findings with a similar sample of schoolchildren. In a well-fitting structural equation model of the data, general intelligence and general discrimination correlated .92. In a reanalysis of data published by Acton and Schroeder (2001), general intelligence and general sensory ability correlated .68 in men and women. One hundred years after its conception, Spearman's other hypothesis achieves some confirmation. The association between general intelligence and general sensory ability remains to be replicated and explained. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Investigated the dimensions underlying person perception, with special attention given to the evaluative dimension. Each of 30 undergraduates described approximately 10 individuals he knew by assigning a subset of 60 personality traits to each individual. The traits supplied to the Ss in this trait-sorting task were selected from a trait-inference study by D. Peabody. The 60 traits were scaled by J. B. Kruskal's program, with a cooccurrence measure for each pair of traits serving as input data. Linear multiple regression was then used to locate an axis in the 3-dimensional space for each of 9 independently rated properties of the traits; 3 of these properties are evaluative. The correlations between each of the 9 properties and the trait space are all at least .75 and are all significant beyond the .001 level. A scoring artifact was discovered in Peabody's data analysis, which accounts for the absence of an evaluative dimension in his study. A reanalysis of his data with artifact removed reveals the presence of a strong evaluative dimension, independent of any particular descriptive dimension. The reanalysis is consistent with the trait-sorting results and with previously published findings by other investigators. (15 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In regards to the article, in a reanalysis of Savin-Williams and Demo's data, Schilling found that within-subject and between-subject effects in analysis of variance were not differentiated and that consequently several findings were in error. Details of the reanalysis and the corrected findings are included in the erratum.] Employing a new self-report technique (paging devices), this study assessed the self-feelings of 35 adolescents (mean age 13.3 yrs) in various naturalistic contexts. Regression analysis was used to assess the stability of self-feelings. Ss fell into 3 groups: stable, oscillating, and unpredictable (the largest). For the sample as a whole, self-feelings were not influenced by the immediate context, although specific settings, activities, and others present within the contexts elicited various levels of self-feelings. More crucial for predicting the self-feelings were such enduring characteristics as sex, social class, pubertal maturation, stability group, birth order, and number of siblings. The authors argue for a baseline conceptualization of adolescent self-conception from which fluctuations occur. (44 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Of particular importance was the child's age, with younger children experiencing more severe abuse. Other variables predicting abuse severity were physical problems (such as infirmity or disability), rejection by the perpetrator, or misbehavior immediately preceding the abuse. The data suggest that the abuse of adolescents may be caused by different factors than those affecting the abuse of young children.

Abstract = {In 1976, C. L. Deutsch and L. A. Gilbert (see PA, Vol 56:5744) used S. L. Bem's balance model (see record [rid]1974-27631-001[/rid]) in a study of self-perceptions of stereotypic masculine and feminine attributes, Rogerian-type conflict, and personal adjustment. Because important conceptual and computational changes have occurred in the measures of psychological masculinity and femininity, a reanalysis of these data was undertaken using J. T. Spence and R. L. Helmreich's absolute mode (see record [rid]1981-02511-001[/rid]). The reanalyses demonstrate the advantage of distinguishing between Androgynous and Undifferentiated individuals rather than grouping them together into a single "balanced" category. The new results also differ from those reported earlier in making apparent the influences on personal adjustment of both Rogerian-type conflict and one's Real Self-Description of masculinity and femininity.

Abstract = {Recorded eye movements as 16 undergraduate Ss read sentences containing temporary structural ambiguities. In accord with the garden-path theory of sentence comprehension, shorter reading times were found for sentences conforming to certain independently motivated parsing strategies (late closure and minimal attachment) than for comparable sentences that violate these strategies. Longer fixation durations were associated with the 1st fixation in the region of the sentence that disambiguated the sentence, suggesting that the human sentence-parsing mechanism operates in a rather systematic fashion, immediately computing the structural consequences of fixated material for the analysis of preceding material. The pattern of regressive eye movements indicated that the parsing mechanism typically engages in selective reanalysis, exploiting whatever information it has available about the type of error it has committed to guide its reanalysis attempts. Understanding the parser's revision procedures is essential to an explanation of why certain linguistic structures cannot be successfully parsed by humans.

The reanalysis used multivariate procedures proven effective in analyzing DRL performance in normal rats. The original analysis (C. T. Johnson et al [see PA, Vol 59:2878]) found a deficit after medial fornix damage. The reanalysis of the data revealed more specifically that the deficit following medial fornix lesions was in the Ss' failure to suppress short-latency responses. However, Ss with lateral fornix damage demonstrated a slight deficit in their ability to localize responding to the earliest period in which reinforcement was available. Alternative interpretations are presented in terms of response inhibition and discrimination deficits. (14 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In 3 experiments and a reanalysis of previous data, hypnotic and nonhypnotic Ss learned a 9-item categorized word list and were then given an amnesia suggestion for the list. Clustering of recall was measured on the recall trials immediately before the suggestion, during it, and after it was cancelled. In Exp I with 173 undergraduates, hypnotic Ss showed more amnesia than task-motivated Ss. However, partial nonrecallers in both of these treatments showed disorganized (i.e., less clustered) recall during the suggestion as compared to before it or after cancelling it. Exp II, with 100 university students, disconfirmed the hypothesis that the greater amnesia of hypnotic as compared to task-motivated Ss, was due to high levels of relaxation in the hypnotic Ss. Disorganization was again found in partial nonrecallers. The reanalysis of clustering data from previous experiments with 196 Ss demonstrated that the disorganization effect was not an artifact produced by reduced recall during the suggestion period, and Exp III (with 166 18–42 yr old Ss) indicated that Ss who followed instructions and faked partial amnesia when explicitly asked to do so (simulators) showed no disorganization effect. An inattention–encoding specificity hypothesis was developed to account for these findings. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Because of current interest in assessing psychosurgery outcome, a reanalysis of Porteus Maze Test findings is presented. The maze tests are generally considered to measure foresight and judgment. Review of the literature relating to the effects of practice on the test shows average gains of 1.25 yrs on the 2nd application of the test and an additional gain of 0.70 yrs on the 3rd application. Much of the early psychosurgery research did not take practice effects into account. Reanalysis of data shows that the magnitude of changes in maze performance depends on the site of surgery and length of time between surgery and testing. The more posterior the frontal lobe surgery and the shorter the postoperative interval, the greater the loss in maze test ability. Losses following relatively posterior frontal lobe surgery are probably permanent. (39 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Also, both "caring" and "emotional stimulation," or "group intensity," which is an encounter group characteristic, are beneficial elements in psychotherapy and encounter groups.

A reanalysis of these same efficacy studies of psycholinguistic training was undertaken to determine the validity of the conclusion that the effectiveness of psycholinguistic training is invalid. A reexamination of 24 of the 38 studies leads to conclusions at marked variance with the statement that psycholinguistic training is not validated. This reanalysis indicated that some studies show significant positive results as measured by the ITPA, some studies show positive results in the areas remediated, and some do not show results from which any conclusion can be drawn.

Goldberg reports that a reanalysis, removing differences in procedures, showed that Libby's data actually reaffirm the conclusions of earlier studies. Flaws in the reanalysis which demonstrate that the original interpretation was valid are discussed: there are tasks in which men outperform their linear models.

The present author's original conclusion that men outperformed their linear models remains; hence, to replace decision makers by their linear models could be a dangerous mistake.

Abstract = {Presents an addendum to "A Comparison of the Electroencephalogram between Institutionalized and Community Children in Romania" by Peter J. Marshall and Nathan A. Fox (Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 2004[Oct], Vol 16[8], 1327-1338). The EEG data presented by Marshall, Fox, and The BEIP Core Group were collected in Bucharest, Romania between April 2001 and November 2003. It was recently discovered that over a period of 4 months in 2001, the channel for the right mastoid electrode was mistakenly switched with the channel for the right occipital electrode. The purpose of this addendum is to briefly present the key similarities and differences between the originally reported findings and the results of the reanalysis. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2004-20176-003[/rid].) Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from a sample of institutionalized infants and young children in Bucharest, Romania, and were compared with EEG data from age-matched children from the local community who had never been institutionalized and who were living with their families in the Bucharest area. Compared with the never-institutionalized group, the institutionalized group showed a pattern of increased low-frequency (theta) power in posterior scalp regions and decreased high-frequency (alpha and beta) power, particularly at frontal and temporal electrode sites. This finding is consistent with EEG studies of children facing environmental adversity and children with learning disorders. The institutionalized group also showed less marked hemispheric EEG asymmetries than the never-institutionalized group, particularly in the temporal region. The results are discussed in the context of two models: that the pattern of EEG in the institutionalized children reflects a maturational lag in nervous system development, or that it reflects tonic cortical hypoactivation.

Abstract = {"Culture and personality" was a focus of anthropology and psychology in the first half of the 20th century. It was concerned with traditional and preliterate societies and drew many of its constructs from psychoanalysis. In this article, we note that taxonomies of personality traits and cultural values developed independently since 1980 have created new possibilities for exploring the topic. The Five-Factor Model of personality is a universally valid taxonomy of traits. The IBM study (conducted by Hofstede) dimensions of culture represent a well-validated operationalization of differences between cultures as manifested in dominant value systems. In reanalyses of recently reported data, mean personality scores from 33 countries were significantly and substantially correlated with culture dimension scores. We discuss environmental and temperamental explanations for these associations and suggest directions for future research, including replications, experimental simulations, acculturation studies, and research on the interaction of traits and culture in shaping human lives.

Abstract = {The mystery of the rise of the affirmative, declarative (periphrastic) use of do in the thirteenth century and its decline by the start of the eighteenth century remains one of the principal unsolved problems for linguists working in historical research. Some of the main arguments on the origins of do discuss the needs of poetic rhyme (e.g., Engblom 1938), the positioning of the adverb (e.g., Ogura 1993), the elimination of awkward consonant clusters (e.g., Stein 1990), and the ambiguities of object referents in questions (Hudson 1997), much of the earlier historical research relying on hypotheses relating to internal problems of the system. The present study examines the early causative origins of do, viewed from a diachronic, construction-based approach, and offers an explanation in which the reanalysis and subsequent loss of do as a declarative, affirmative auxiliary took place via a process known as hyperanalysis (Croft 2000), resulting in the gradual process of co-lexicalization of the causative verb meaning within the semantics of the main verb across an ever-increasing range of main verb environments.

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between span memory [e.g., immediate memory, short-term memory (STM), simple span] and general ability (g) though a reanalysis of two data sets [Christal, R. E. (1959). Factor analytic study of visual memory. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 72 (13, Whole No. 466); (see record [rid]2011-17378-001[/rid]); Kelley, H.P. (1964). Memory abilities: A factor analysis. Psychometric Monographs, No. 11]. Because of their large sample sizes and the multiple measures used to identify each construct, the Christal and Kelley studies were examined within a "best evidence synthesis" framework. Modern structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques were used to examine the relationship between immediate memory and g. Results indicated that in both studies, the relationship between immediate memory and g was quite substantial (.71 and .83), and that this relationship was essentially reduced by half when the common content variance of the tests was accounted for (e.g., verbal, spatial, numerical). Results are discussed within the context of recent research examining the relationship between working memory (WM) and g. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The gains of scores on standardized intelligence tests (i.e., Flynn effect) have been the subject of extensive debate concerning their nature, causes, and implications. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether five intelligence tests are measurement invariant with respect to cohort. Measurement invariance implies that gains over the years can be attributed to increases in the latent variables that the tests purport to measure. The studies reported contain original data of Dutch Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) gains from 1967 to 1999, Dutch Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) gains from 1984 to 1995, gains on a Dutch children intelligence test (RAKIT) from 1982 to 1993, and reanalyses of results from Must, Must, and Raudik [Intelligence 167 (2003) 1-11] and Teasdale and Owen [Intelligence 28 (2000) 115-120]. The results of multigroup confirmatory factor analyses clearly indicate that measurement invariance with respect to cohorts is untenable. Uniform measurement bias is observed in some, but not all subtests. The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In addition to numerous reports about psychophysiological stress responses to acute stressors, there are few data available on gender differences of stress-induced heart rate responses In multiple age groups applying the same psychological stressor. Second, the assessment of poststress recovery appears to be neglected in the empirical literature. For this study, data from 5 independent studies were reanalyzed to investigate the impact of age and gender on heart rate responses and poststress recovery to a standardized psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) in 28 children, 34 younger adults, and 26 older adults. As expected, prestressor baselines correlated significantly with chronological age (r=-.27, p=.01). There was a marked age-related decrease in the heart rate stress response (p=.0003) with children and younger adults showing significantly higher increases than elderly persons. The analysis of gender effects showed that girls had higher heart rate increases during the stress exposure than boys (p=.03). In younger adults, stress responsivity was also higher in women (p=.03). Peak heart rate responses were comparable in older men and women, with only men returning to prestressor baselines during the observation period. In sum, this reanalysis revealed differential heart rate responses and recovery after exposition to the TSST in healthy children, younger adults, and elderly adults.

Abstract = {The author describes the analysis of a severely depressed patient and her reanalysis, focusing especially on the ensuing "arrested hopelessness" in the counter-transference which had to be overcome. Central are the conditions for a modulation of the counter-transference. As modulation, the author defines changes in the enduring relationship between analyst and analysand. In the end, they change the direction, intensity, and mood of the analytic process lastingly and help to overcome the anti-therapeutic factors. Apart from an overview of technical aspects in the treatment of the psychodynamics of depressive diseases, the special importance of the mechanism of "extractive introjection" for their origins and variations of their return in the transference/counter-transference relationship is shown. The author describes how the patient slowly begins to reclaim self possession, thus allowing fundamental insights and lasting changes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Freud's surprising formulation (sensibly supplemented by Strachey) in "The Ego and the Id" (1923, p. 39), of dead warriors' continuation of their struggle in a higher region (referring to Wilhelm von K.aulbach's painting The Battle of the Huns), connotatively has the theme of pathology transcending and telescoping the generations. In a case study, the concealed external reality of a woman's father (his involvement in atrocities during World War II, his conviction without serving his sentence) had an eminently pathogenic and pathoplastic influence on her and resulted in a "borrowed unconscious sense of guilt" becoming an encapsulated part of her personality. A shared reflection on contemporary history from the perpetrators' perspective was possible only after a long latency and proved to be indispensable for reanalysis a decade later, particularly under the aspect of superego splitting. Pathology transcending generations confronts us with the technical problem of removing the contamination of borrowed and not borrowed unconscious senses of guilt, not borrowed under the aspect of the patient's personal history, which is characterized by a presumed oedipal triumph after her mother's early death.

Abstract = {Two experiments examined the effects of word familiarity on word recognition and text comprehension during silent reading. Readers' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences containing words that varied in familiarity as assessed by printed estimates of word frequency, subjective ratings of familiarity, and a multiple-choice test of meaning knowledge. Effects of word frequency were unaffected by differences in subjective familiarity rating for high frequency words. Differential effects of familiarity rating were observed in low frequency conditions. In addition, processing time on high and low frequency words did not differ when familiarity was held constant for moderately familiar words. Readers spent more initial processing time on novel words than familiar words. Performance on a vocabulary test administered after the reading session demonstrated that readers successfully acquired and retained new word meanings. Finally, reanalysis of word processing time as a function of vocabulary test performance demonstrated a systematic relationship between online processing patterns and memory for novel word meaning.

We show that PH's rationales for excluding some 815 students--more than 40% of their sample-- because they lacked baseline data in a randomized experiment are unconvincing. For example, PH's assertion that students with missing baseline scores had a greater risk of mismatch is based on a misunderstanding of the way the experiment was conducted; the organization that conducted the experiment believes the procedures actually used precluded such a problem. Including students with missing baseline data renders the effect of vouchers insignificant for Black students, even using PH's nonstandard racial classification scheme. PH also give the misleading impression that our reanalysis shows their results to be robust. In fact, only 7 out of the 27 of our estimates that did not simply reuse PH's original, incomplete sample of Black students are positive and statistically significant.

This has resulted in a revision of some of the conclusions reached with regard to the 10° color-matching functions proposed by the CIE in 1959. The results of the reanalysis strongly suggest that the proposed 10° color-matching functions predict adequately the observations made by actual Os on the Donaldson colorimeter. A failure of additivity in large-field color matching cannot be detected with certainty for the observational mean of 10 Os. However, for individual Os there remains the possibility of a failure of additivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In their reanalysis of our data on effectiveness of interferon-β in relapsing multiple sclerosis, Renoux and Suissa hypothesize that our findings are subject to "excluded" immortal time bias, which is accounted for as the difference from disease onset to cohort entry (ie, disease duration) between treatment and control groups. Renoux and Suissa's analysis is based on an erroneous mix of estimated values derived from our PS analysis and crude values given by mean follow-up multiplied by the difference of disease duration between the two groups. The main assumption that treatment switch should not be conditional on patients' characteristics at each specific time is violated, and with treatment switch occurring at different points in time, it will not be possible, as for open-label extension trials, to control for confounding.

DeSoto and Hitlan reanalyzed an original data set, concluding that a relationship exists between blood mercury levels and the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The conclusion is based on the reanalysis of hair to blood mercury ratios. As elegantly demonstrated by Grandjean and colleagues, mercury levels in the hair reflect a delayed average compared to the blood mercury level averages. That is, mercury hair concentrations at hypothetical time point T reflect blood mercury levels at T minus 1 to 2 months. The analysis by DeSoto and Hitlan, which presumes that the 2 biomarkers are equally affected, is clearly erroneous. Thus, absent appropriate corrections for the temporal fluctuations in mercury levels, the conclusions should be interpreted with utmost caution and revalidated taking the above issue into account.

Using this procedure significant differences were found between the group who know the subtest was untimed versus the group which did not know if the subtest was timed or untimed. Reanalysis of the data used three statistical alternatives: (a) Bonferroni correction for all possible t tests, (b) one-way analysis of variance, and (c) selected t tests with the Bonferroni correction. All three analyses yielded nonsignificant differences between means, thereby changing the conclusions of Knight's study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Coming of age is the biopsychosocial process by which the ascending generation achieves autonomy, independence, and self-responsibility. In the psychic realm these have a parricidal significance and trigger conflicts of aggression. The analysis of these conflicts poses special problems of methodology and technique for the analyst who needs to make the analytic situation a safe place for himself when he finds himself on the receiving end of the patient's aggression. Three men who came to analysis with late adolescent-young adult issues are presented. Two were also in analysis in childhood and the third returned for analysis in late middle age. The need for reanalysis is examined in the framework of contemporary concepts of development. Other motivations for returning to analysis are identified: Analysis in childhood tends to establish the analyst as guide and mentor paralleling the parent-child relationship; the analytic experience fosters the conviction that understanding how the mind works is an essential tool for living more comfortably with oneself and others.

Abstract = {This article examines principals' espoused values and their values in action. It provides a reanalysis of previously collected data through a values lens. The original research study was an international quantitative and qualitative investigation of principals' leadership approaches that was based in 15 schools. This particular excerpt of the research provides a qualitative lens into two European principals' espoused values versus values in action in a site-based management environment. The study demonstrates that principals' espoused values can be different from their values in action as perceived by themselves and others. This has implications for the practical application of modern school restructuring site-based management theory, and it shows the need for a value-based component to principals' leadership training.

Abstract = {In 1998, Cohen described a study showing that in the United States, regionally distributed culture controls the direction of the relationship between social stability and homicide rates. In the South and West, where, according to Cohen, there is a culture of honor, strong community and family bonds increase honor-related violence. Conversely, in the North, where the culture of honor is rare, strong social bonds restrain violence of all kinds. This article describes a reanalysis using Cohen's data sources that finds little association between measures of social stability and homicide rates. Cohen's findings are due to errors in the measurement of homicide that lead to an excessive number of zero values and a few extremely high values that heavily influence the slope estimates. Alternative estimates using larger counties or a logistic regression model that eliminates the impact of the extreme values lead to estimates that are inconsistent with the theory.

Abstract = {The role of relatives' expressed emotion (EE) in mediating the efficacy of family interventions has been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with schizophrenia and depression. Reanalysis of two RCTs (n=48) by Leff (1989) indicated that lowering relatives' EE and/or reducing social contact between the patient and family members accounted for the efficacy of the intervention for schizophrenia. However, this relationship has not been investigated previously with regard to depression, and this paper presents the results of a recent RCT which included measurement of EE and other possible mediating variables. In this study, amelioration of the critical attitude of the partner did not account for the superiority of couples therapy over antidepressant medication, since the same change occurred in the drug group. However, reducing the patient's exposure to the partner's hostility partially explained the efficacy of couples therapy. Further research on the process of change in families undergoing therapy is indicated to identify the variables that account for the efficacy of therapy.

Abstract = {Recent examples of research about group processes melding individual-cognitive and social communicative factors have resulted in the application of concepts relevant to individual cognition to groups as a whole. Although based on a helpful metaphor, the practice risks resurrecting discredited "group mind" concepts. One particular concept, "transactive memory system," implies that a group can "know" all of the knowledge of its individual members. Several studies showing that groups remember more information than do its individual members appear on their face to support this notion. However, a reanalysis of the results of these studies using Lorge-Solomon (1955) Model B reveals that the groups were not successful at pooling their members' knowledge. This conclusion implies that group interaction does not lead to efficient group information exchange. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {As task performance improves with practice, oftentimes fewer brain areas are recruited to aid in processing. However, relatively little research has investigated how practice affects interactions between brain regions. Given prior work indicating that interhemispheric division of processing is most advantageous when task demands are high, we predicted that interactions between the cerebral hemispheres would be less advantageous after practice than before practice. This hypothesis was confirmed by reanalysis of data from two previously published studies. Practice reduced (1) the degree to which interhemispheric interaction facilitated performance for two letter-matching tasks (Experiment 1), and (2) the extent to which interhemispheric interaction reduced interference in a global-local perception task (Experiment 2). These findings illustrate the dynamic nature of neural recruitment in response to changing task demands. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Examined the effect of length variation in the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) on individual differences in cardiovascular response to psychological challenge. Heart rate (HR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBF) responses to computerized versions of 2 psychological challenges, the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test and mental arithmetic, were measured among 131 monozygotic (MZ) and 60 dizygotic (DZ) male or female (same-sex) European-American twin pairs. Among the 382 Ss, 140 were homozygous for the "long" allele (1/1) at 5-HTTLPR, 61 were homozygous for the "short" allele (s/s), and 181 Ss had one long and one short allele (1/s). Association and sib-pair analyses were performed to characterize genetic associations. In the full sample, 5-HTTLPR was associated with HR reactivity to psychological challenge, albeit in interaction with sex. Task-elicited HR responses of women homozygous for the short allele were significantly greater than among: a) men of the same genotype; and b) women having either one (1/s) or two (1/1) long alleles at 5-HTTLPR. SBP and DBF responsivity was unrelated to genotype. These results were corroborated on reanalysis in 2 genetically independent subsamples.

Abstract = {The visual analog scale (VAS) is one of the most commonly used measures of pain intensity in pain research. However, there remain important unanswered questions concerning interpretation of specific VAS ratings and change scores. To address these questions, we performed a reanalysis of data from 2 randomized controlled trials of postoperative pain (N = 123 and N = 125) to determine the meaning of VAS pain intensity ratings and change scores. The findings suggested that 100-mm VAS ratings of 0 to 4 mm can be considered no pain; 5 to 44 mm, mild pain; 45 to 74 mm, moderate pain; and 75 to 100 mm, severe pain. As predicted, in assessment of the amount of change corresponding to differing levels of pain relief, percentage change in a patient's VAS score was less biased by pretreatment pain than was absolute change score. The findings also suggested that a 33% decrease in pain represents a reasonable standard for determining that a change in pain is meaningful from the patient's perspective.

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine 1) whether the risk for familial transmission of suicidal behavior is greater with increased family loading for suicide attempts, and 2) whether the transmission of suicidal behavior is mediated by impulsive aggression. METHOD: A reanalysis of a high-risk study compared the offspring of three mood disorder proband groups: suicide attempters with a sibling who also attempted suicide (N=19), suicide attempters whose siblings never made a suicide attempt (N=73), and nonsuicidal probands whose siblings also never engaged in suicidal behavior (N=73). Probands and offspring were assessed with respect to psychopathology, suicide attempt history, impulsive aggression, and exposure to familial adversity. RESULTS: Offspring of suicide attempters with siblings concordant for suicidal behavior showed a higher risk of suicide attempt than did offspring of nonsuicidal probands and had an earlier age at onset of suicidal behavior than offspring of suicide attempters with siblings discordant for suicidal behavior. Probands from sibling pairs concordant for suicidal behavior and their offspring reported greater lifetime impulsive aggression compared with each of the other two proband/offspring groups...

Abstract = {The development of social theory is introduced as a dialectic between primary and secondary thinking. Secondary thinking views the social and cultural world in determinate, positive, rational terms; primary thinking recognizes the indeterminate, negative and irrational as forever immanent in human action. Max Weber's work illustrates the dynamic interaction between the two forms of thinking, which are further developed with ideas from religion, the philosophy of pragmatism and the psychoanalysis of artistic imagination. The primary-secondary dialectic is then applied to a reanalysis of early sociological studies of mass society, which is reinterpreted as social mass. The primary nature of mass is revealed as an ever-present absence, which, like Weber's idea of 'meaningless infinity', resists all secondary attempts to express it in clear, determinate, positive forms. The primary-secondary interaction is further illustrated through the technologies of the modern mass media and the 'consumption' of space and time implied by globalization.

Abstract = {The relation between working memory (WM) limitation and sentence comprehension was assessed in Hebrew-speaking aphasics, three conduction aphasics and three agrammatics. The study compared sentences that required different types of reactivation-syntactic-semantic reactivation, in relative clauses, and word form/phonological reactivation, in sentences with reanalysis of lexical ambiguity. The effect of phonological memory load, manipulated by number of words intervening between the activation and the reactivation, on comprehension of the two sentence types was examined. The findings were that agrammatic aphasics failed in the comprehension of object relatives but not on subject relatives irrespective of their antecedent-gap distance. Conduction aphasics, on the other hand, who showed severe WM limitation, comprehended well all types of relative clauses and were unaffected by antecedent-gap distance. The conduction aphasics failed to understand the sentences that required phonological reactivation when the phonological distance was long. These results suggest that the type of reactivation required by the sentence, as well as the type of memory overload are crucial in determining the effect of WM limitation on sentence comprehension.

They demonstrated logical flaws associated with the common Kendall's Τb -based alliance similarity measure and showed that using S may yield quite different similarity estimates. But without a broader empirical comparison and analysis using S, the full empirical ramifications of this difference is not known. In this study, a comparison of S versus Τb is conducted over a wide spatial and temporal domain, examining the relationship between S, Τb , expected utility scores, and conflict. Despite significant positive correlations, important differences in the distribution of 5 and Τb -based measures of alliance similarity are found. It should not be assumed that the measures are substitutable. Reanalysis of an important expected utility theory of war shows a stronger relationship between equilibrium predictions and conflict when S is used versus Τb.

Abstract = {The Sense of Community Index (SCI) is the most widely used measure of the construct, despite the lack of confirmation of its intended dimensions or subscales. Yet psychometric appraisals of the SCI have never used the proper tool for evaluating an established dimensional construct: confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The Block Booster Project data set (of residents of 47 street blocks in Brooklyn and Queens, New York) used in developing the original SCI in 1985 was used here in its reassessment, along with a 1-year follow-up survey expanded to 61 blocks. The SCI reanalysis using CFA yielded poor model fit for D. W. McMillan and D. M. Chavis' (1986) original theoretical formulation, prompting development of a Brief SCI. The 8-item, 3-factor BSCI showed good model fit with CFA, reliable construct validity in multilevel correlational analyses, and it differentiated street block neighborhoods reliably based on intragroup agreement, while retaining the profile of a cognitive-perceptual construct, which does not crossover with other popular community psychology constructs. The authors, however, recommend future uses of the BSCI employ a 5-point Likert-type response format to increase the measure's variability, sensitivity, and internal reliability.

Abstract = {Picture naming speed is strongly influenced by the age of acquisition (AoA) of words. Most studies of AoA have relied on adults' AoA ratings. However, objective AoA has been found to be a stronger determinant of picture naming latencies. Whereas objective AoA norms for words have been collected for some language communities, no objective AoA measures for words were previously available in French. The study provides objective AoA norms for a set of 230 object names following the procedures used by Morrison, Chappell, and Ellis (1997) to collect objective AoA measures in English. The relationships between objective AoA measures, rated AoA, other variables used in psycholinguistic experiments (name agreement, image agreement, conceptual familiarity, etc.), the English data collected by Morrison et al., and naming latencies are analysed and discussed.

Abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) were employed to compare word category and verb inflection violations in Spanish. A similar frontal negativity was found between 250-400 ms for both violation types, suggesting that they equally disrupt initial syntactic analyses. Also, word category violations elicited a negativity at posterior electrodes larger than verb inflection anomalies and correct sentences within this time window, probably reflecting difficulties in semantically analyzing phrase structure violations. Finally, a centroparietal positivity in the 500-700 ms interval was found for both error types. Both violations did not differ along the first half of this interval (500-600 ms), but larger effects for verb inflection violations were reported along the second half of this period (600-700 ms). These findings suggest that whereas processes dealing with the reanalyses of sentence structure are equally triggered by both anomaly types, further attempts at repairing the structure of sentences occur only with inflection violations.

Abstract = {Observers completed perceptual categorization tasks in which base rates and payoffs were manipulated separately or simultaneously across a range of category discriminabilities. Decision criterion estimates from the simultaneous base-rate/payoff conditions were closer to optimal than those predicted from the independence assumption, in line with predictions from the flat-maxima hypothesis. A hybrid model that instantiated the flat-maxima and competition between reward and accuracy maximization hypotheses was applied to the data as well as used in a reanalysis of C. J. Bohill and W. J. Maddox's (2001) study. The hybrid model was superior to a model that incorporated the independence assumption, suggesting that violations of the independence assumption are to be expected and are well captured by the flat-maxima hypothesis, without requiring any additional assumptions.

Abstract = {Structural reanalysis is generally assumed to be representation-preserving, whereby the initial analysis is manipulated or repaired to arrive at a new structure. This paper contends that the theoretical and empirical basis for such approaches is weak. A conceptually simpler alternative is that the processor reprocesses (some portion of) the input using just those structure-building operations available in first-pass parsing. This reprocessing is a necessary component of any realistic processing model. By contrast, the structural revisions required for second-pass repair are more powerful than warranted by the abilities of the first-pass parser. This paper also reviews experimental evidence for repair presented by P. Sturt et al (1999). We demonstrate that the Sturt et al findings are consistent with a reprocessing account and present a self-paced reading experiment intended to tease apart the repair and reprocessing accounts. 53 students were presented with sentences using a word-by-word display on a computer monitor. A yes/no comprehension question followed each sentence. Ss responded correctly to 90.6% of comprehension questions after experimental items. The results support a reprocessing interpretation of Sturt et al's data, rendering a repair-based explanation superfluous. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This reanalysis of a previously reported clinical trial assessed whether quetiapine or haloperidol has benefits for the treatment of hostility and agitation among patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. 257 Ss aged 18–65 yrs of either sex and any ethnicity who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and who were experiencing an acute exacerbation were recruited. A priori, data from patients assigned to 4 therapeutically effective quetiapine treatment groups (150, 300, 600, and 750 mg) in a previously reported 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial were combined and compared with data from patients given haloperidol 12 mg or placebo on an agitation measure derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Quetiapine treatment reduced agitation scores significantly among patients with acute psychoses. A slight reduction in agitation scores was found when haloperidol treatment was compared with placebo. Compared with haloperidol, quetiapine treatment had a direct and significant effect on agitation that was independent of the improvement in psychotic symptoms. The data suggest that quetiapine treatment has benefits for hostility and agitation among patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.

Abstract = {Many jail inmates have a history of substance use and "abuse"; few, however, receive comprehensive treatment for substance use disorders while in jail. The authors offer a longitudinal reanalysis of data from five jail-based substance user treatment programs. Survival analysis was used to identify client characteristics associated with length of time in treatment. Survival curves for the five programs were compared, indicating which ones retained inmates the longest. Results from a model stratified by jail site revealed that inmates over 25 years of age and those already sentenced had significantly longer treatment stays. The Substance Abuse Intervention Division (SAID) program, a modified therapeutic community in a New York jail, and the Deciding, Educating, Understanding, Counseling, and Evaluation (DEUCE) program, a curriculum-based intervention, had the longest survival curves and were, therefore, most effective at retaining inmates in treatment.

This investigation involved reanalyses of data from 2 earlier studies (Rogers, Grandjean, Tillbrook, Vitacco, & Sewell, 2001; Ustad, Rogers, & Salekin, 1998). Focusing on 2 clinical samples from a metropolitan jail, we investigated its subscales via exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. A good model fit was found (comparative fit index=.92; robust comparative fit index=.94) for 4 subscales (Dysphoria, Psychosis, Mania, and Insomnia) with good interrater reliability (M intraclass coefficient=.95) and clinical relevance. As a preliminary screen for feigned mental disorders, 2 detection scales (Symptom Combinations and Symptom Selectivity) were moderately successful. By maximizing negative predictive power, the SADS-C detection strategies proved effective at ruling out feigning for mentally disordered offenders with a high likelihood of genuine disorders.

Abstract = {We propose that the essence of consumption is the mental process of generating utility from products, that this process expends consumption effort, and that consumers take consumption effort into account in their decision making. In 2 studies, we tested the hypothesis that consumption preferences become more ambitious--individuals become more inclined to choose challenging-to-consume products--when consumer energy levels are elevated. In Study 1, energy induced by ingesting caffeine increased participants' tendency to choose subtitled foreign movies rather than domestic remakes of those same movies. Study 2 demonstrated the same effect with naturally occurring energy levels and with consumption experiences whose effortfulness and quality were varied independently. In choosing among sets of poems to read, participants with higher levels of energy exhibited less effort aversion but neither more nor less quality seeking. A reanalysis of Study 1 showed that the energy effect is not simply a case of consumers using more energy when they have more energy, because the energy effect disappeared when participants were made aware of the energy source, suggesting that a preference-correction process occurred. The energy dependence of consumer preferences affords tactical opportunities... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {A simple behavioural task may involve the presentation of two or more stimuli. Any learning that takes place in such a situation may be analysed in terms of the formation of an association between the central representations of those stimuli. Presumably performance based on this learning can occur because presentation of one stimulus will then activate the representations of other stimuli that were previously presented with it. To examine the role that these representations play in learning in and of themselves requires that the stimuli themselves are absent. A review of a number of flavour preference and aversion studies indicates that an associatively activated stimulus representation can support learning that is both similar to and the opposite of that maintained by the presentation of the stimulus itself. Which occurs is dependent upon the nature of the reinforcer and the temporal relationships between the training events. Although this pattern of results appears suggestive of separate learning rules, a reanalysis raises the possibility of an explanation in terms of a single associative system.

Abstract = {In this ERP study we investigate the processes that occur in syntactically ambiguous German sentences at the point of disambiguation. To distinguish empirically between parallel and serial parsing models, we compare ERP responses to garden-path sentences with ERP responses to truly ungrammatical sentences. Garden-path sentences contain a temporary and ultimately curable ungrammaticality, whereas truly ungrammatical sentences remain so permanently--a difference which gives rise to different predictions in the two classes of parsing architectures. At the disambiguating word, ERPs in both sentence types show negative shifts of similar onset latency, amplitude, and scalp distribution in an initial time window between 300 and 500 ms. In a following time window (500-700 ms), the negative shift to garden-path sentences disappears at right central parietal sites, while it continues in permanently ungrammatical sentences. These data are taken as evidence for a strictly serial parser. The absence of a difference in the early time window indicates that temporary and permanent ungrammaticalities trigger the same kind of parsing responses. Later differences can be related to successful reanalysis in garden-path but not in ungrammatical sentences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Urban, man-made environments are the most common living environments in the emerging knowledge-based society of the industrial world. A number of technology domains frame the urban setting that in turn frames the daily quality-of-life of man, including older persons. It is argued that the five domains of core ambitions in individuals most related to quality of life include: health and self-esteem, mobility and transport, housing and living, communication and governance, and work and leisure. A reanalysis of the theoretical basis for gerontechnology indicates that the impact of technology most related to these areas of application falls into four groups: enhancement and satisfaction, prevention and engagement, compensation and assistance, and care support and organisation. A matrix of domains and impacts provides a template that embodies an enriched taxonomy of the gerontechnological field. Using citations in this journal, the matrix is used to show the areas of greatest progress in the development over the past decade as well as the most promising areas of future development. Current changes in technology require an increase in the need for user-orientation in the choices related to technology development as well as dispersal as advocated by gerontechnology since its early days. Analysis of the advances and current gaps in the matrix elements may serve as a guiding principle for a sustainable development of technology for older persons and probably for society as a whole.

In this study male patients with MS performed more poorly than female patients on tests of verbal and nonverbal memory, visuospatial construction, and on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The groups of male and female patients were similar in age, education, and on several measures of neurologic and emotional disturbance. Among normals there are no sex differences on the MMSE and WCST. Sex differences on the memory and visuospatial construction tests were larger in magnitude for the patients than for normal controls, implying that male patients are somehow especially vulnerable to cognitive deficits.

Pigeons received a go/no-go task in which the lower entropy arrays were reinforced for one group and the higher entropy arrays were reinforced for a second group. The superior discrimination of the second group was predicted by a theoretical analysis in which excitatory and inhibitory stimulus generalization gradients fall along a logarithmic, but not a linear scale.

Abstract = {In a study (n = 11 female and 9 male undergraduate students; mean age 21 yrs) using event-related brain potentials, the authors show that the current characterization of the P600 component as an indicator of revision processes (reanalysis and repair) in sentence comprehension must be extended to include the recognition of syntactic ambiguity. By comparing the processing of ambiguous and unambiguous sentence constituents in German, the authors show that the P600 is elicited when our language processing system has syntactic alternatives at a certain item given in the input string. That the P600 is sensitive to syntactic ambiguity adds crucial evidence to current debates in psycholinguistic modelling, as the results clearly favour parallel models of syntactic processing which assume that ambiguity is recognized and costly.

Abstract = {The surface electromyographic (EMG) signal from right and left trapezius muscles and the heart rate were recorded over 24 h in 27 healthy female subjects. The root-meansquare (RMS) value of the surface EMG signals and the heartbeat interval time series were calculated with a time resolution of 0.2 s. The EMG activity during sleep showed long periods with stable mean amplitude, modulated by rhythmic components in the frequency range 0.05-0.2 Hz. The ratio between the amplitude of the oscillatory components and the mean amplitude of the EMG signal was approximately constant over the range within which the phenomenon was observed, corresponding to a peak-to-peak oscillatory amplitude of ∼10% of the mean amplitude. The duration of the periods with stable mean amplitude ranged from a few minutes to ∼1 h, usually interrupted by a sudden change in the activity level or by cessation of the muscle activity. Right and left trapezius muscles presented the same pattern of FM. In supplementary experiments, rhythmic muscle activity pattern was also demonstrated in the upper extremity muscles of deltoid, biceps, and forearm flexor muscles. There was no apparent association between the rhythmic components in the muscle activity pattern and the heart rate variability. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the above-described pattern of EMG activity during sleep is documented. On reanalysis of earlier recorded trapezius motor unit firing pattern in experiments on awake subjects in a situation with mental stress, low-FM of firing with similar frequency content was detected. Possible sources of rhythmic excitation of trapezius motoneurons include slow-wave cortical oscillations represented in descending cortico-spinal pathways, and/or activation by monoaminergic pathways originating in the brain stem reticular formation. The analysis of muscle activity patterns may provide an important new tool to study neural mechanisms in human sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The present study examined through a quantitative analysis of newspapers how fast people forget natural disasters and accidents which caused considerable damage. We reviewed several empirical studies, finding out a long-term trend, which approximated to a form of an exponential curve, describing how people lose their concern in the events. However, the reanalysis of these data revealed two major factors which affect this fading out process. Firstly, a series of events interfere with each other so that the following event may lead people to forget the preceding one. Secondly, the wearing out processes slow down every time the monthly or annual anniversary of the event comes. Furthermore, we demonstrated how, besides media coverage analyses, some collective behavior variables, such as passenger decrease after major airplane accidents, may be helpful in measuring collective forgetting.

Abstract = {Smokers' responses to the Smoking Consequences Questionnaire--Adult (A. L. Copeland, T. H. Brandon, and E. P. Quinn, 1995) were used to determine whether smoking outcome expectancies are moderated by subjective evaluations (desirability ratings) in their effect on smoking-related variables. Hierarchical regression in a reanalysis of data from A. L. Copeland et al indicated that the product of probability and desirability ratings accounted for a significant amount of variance in smoking rate, nicotine dependence, saliva cotinine, and posttreatment smoking status above that accounted for by probability and desirability ratings alone. Results indicate that desirability ratings serve as moderators to probability ratings in explaining current smoking, nicotine dependence, and continued smoking. Effects were modest in magnitude but suggest that it may be important to address subjective evaluations of outcomes in smoking cessation and relapse prevention efforts.

In this commentary, the major flaws in J. C. Schank's arguments regarding the calculation of synchrony are presented. Low standard deviations (< 2.0) of interwomen cycle lengths were found in a reanalysis of the Bedouin family data (A. Weller & L. Weller, 1997). This obviates J. C. Schank's major assumption that a high degree of cycle variability exists and his concern that high variability produces a spurious increase of onset differences over time. Furthermore, research that has used random control groups has found significantly greater levels of synchrony in their experimental groups, refuting J. C. Schank's arguments.

This reanalysis examined the potential confounding influence of prerandomization lithium level and change in lithium level on the outcome of subjects assigned to a standard or low maintenance dose of lithium. In a Cox proportional hazards model incorporating pre-and postrandomization lithium levels and the interaction of these factors, only the interaction term remained significantly associated with time to recurrence. The findings indicate that change in serum lithium level may be a more powerful predictor of recurrence of bipolar disorder than the absolute assignment to a low or a standard dose of lithium and suggest than an abrupt decrease in lithium level should be avoided.

A new method of urinalysis--instant/urine testing--may offer a quicker, equally accurate alternative to laboratory assays. To date, however, no studies have explored the efficacy of instant urine technology with individuals under criminal justice supervision. To address this limitation, the authors administered a single instant urine test--the OnTrak Testcup-5--to 136 adult male arrestees surveyed through Maryland's Substance Abuse Need for Treatment among Arrestees (SANTA) study. The specimens were subsequently shipped to an independent laboratory for reanalysis. Analyses indicate high agreement between the two techniques for marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Potential uses for the OnTrak Testcup-5 are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Illustrates the use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to explicate constructs underlying performance assessment tasks based on H. Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences. Data from J. Plucker et al (see record [rid]1996-04908-004[/rid]) were reanalyzed using CFA. I analyzed several models based on the theoretical conceptualization of the authors, their exploratory factor analysis, and the subsequent reanalysis of the data by M. Pyryt (2000). Models that allowed for intercorrelations among factors fit better than those without such correlations. Although the performance tasks appeared to measure their constructs as predicted, a model with three factors that combined Linguistic and Interpersonal Intelligence, rather than the 4 original factors, was supported. Higher order models indicated the presence of a general factor underlying the multiple intelligences. Although not conforming exactly to the original theory, it appears that this set of performance tasks is a step in the right direction in terms of measuring multiple intelligences. Pyryt's concern for the influence of g was confirmed to some extent, but it appears that both factors and individual tasks retain sufficient variance to allow for the interpretation that they measure separate abilities.

Abstract = {Event-related potentials were used to investigate whether the processing of subject-verb dependencies is influenced by (1) the linear distance between the subject and the verb and (2) the presence of an intervening noun phrase with interfering number features. Participants (aged 18-25 yrs) were monolingual speakers of Dutch. Linear distance did not affect integration and diagnosis or revision processes at the verb, as indexed by early negative and P600 components. This is in accordance with hierarchy-based models of reanalysis, but is problematic for distance-based integration models. However, tracking of the subject features is affected by linear factors: more judgment errors were made in the long compared to the short condition. Furthermore, the presence of a plural object between the singular subject and the verb led to more judgment errors, and an enhanced positivity around 250 ms for the grammatical verbs. This suggests that linear factors affect feature tracking, but not integration processes following feature retrieval or repair processes following the detection of a mismatch.

Journal articles were the most frequently cited type of reference, cited by critics (1,022/1,526 of references, 67%) and supporters (39/60, 65%). However, journal articles submitted by critics had lower impact factors than those cited by supporters. Participation in the public input process was not balanced among all interested parties. Critics and supporters of the risk assessment used different criteria to evaluate the scientific evidence, suggesting that they were socially constructing the evidence to support their positions.

Abstract = {Notes that people comprehend utterances rapidly and without conscious effort. Traditional theories assume that sentence processing is algorithmic and that meaning is derived compositionally. The language processor is believed to generate representations of the linguistic input that are complete, detailed, and accurate. However, findings challenge these assumptions. Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. The authors suggest a "good enough" approach to language comprehension which holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete. Future work will elucidate the conditions under which sentence processing is simply good enough. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A model of successful leadership was developed using a qualitative research method in a reanalysis of Kaltman's analysis of General Ulysses S. Grant's leadership. The model rests on a person by situation interactional perspective but has a person-oriented focus. It suggests that leader actions are affected by task-related competence, management competence, and social competence. These competencies, in turn, are affected by the leader's physical shape, psychological base, and value base. The model was related to two leading models in the field: situational leadership and transformational leadership. The study constitutes an attempt to elicit tacit knowledge and put it into a scientific framework. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {An investigation of the dimensionality of processing times due to contributions of perceptual and cognitive processes is reported. For this purpose the data of 124 participants were submitted to a reanalysis. These data were obtained by means of five tests for the assessment of efficiency of perceptual processes, five tests for the assessment of efficiency of cognitive processes and two intelligence tests. A two-factor model with factors of perceptual and cognitive processing times was evaluated by means of confirmatory factor analysis and compared with a one-factor- and a three-factor models. The two-factor model proved to be most appropriate. For representing the error scores of the five tests for the assessment of efficiency of cognitive processes a one-factor showed to be sufficient. The factor scores made it possible to predict 50 percent of the variance in general intelligence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Previous studies have reported an interaction between visual field (VF) and word length such that word recognition is affected more by length in the left VF (LVF) than in the right VF (RVF). A reanalysis showed that the previously reported effects of length were confounded with orthographic neighborhood size (NS). In 3 experiments the authors manipulated length and NS in lateralized lexical decision tasks. 24 Ss (aged 18-29 yrs; Exp 1), 24 Ss (aged 18-25 yrs; Exp 2), and 24 Ss (aged 18-26 yrs; Exp 2) participated in the study. Results showed that length and VF interacted even with NS controlled (Exp 1); that NS affected responses to words in the LVF but not the RVF (Exp 2); and that when length and NS were combined, length only affected performance in the LVF for words with few neighbors.

Abstract = {Reviews a segment from a report of a research project from 1991. In this initial entry into the research world, the research process used aimed to make audible one part of the "personal practical knowledge" of a group of music teachers. By critiquing one segment of the report and contrasting this with a re-analysis of the original data upon which this segment relies, an alternative view of the research process and the research findings may be gained.The research process used in the first report aimed to allow teachers' voices and knowledge to become explicit. In fact, it may be seen to gloss over underlying discourses and in doing so, romanticize those voices. Concomitantly, a reanalysis of the original data using methods drawn from conversation analysis reveals the ways in which the researcher's voice is indelibly inscribed in the research process. The critique presented here elucidates the ways in which 'theorizing as ideology' may be accomplished by a novice researcher in the writing of a research report. Further, the utilization of conversation analysis to investigate interview transcripts of teacher talk demonstrates an approach to data analysis which might be further explored by researchers employing interviews as a method of data generation.

On the basis of the unimodality of search slope distributions in a very large data set, J. M. Wolfe (1998) argued for a continuum model.

Abstract = {This reflection on a study is grounded in a revisioning of one set of data from a longitudinal study of children who were prenatally exposed to crack/cocaine. For this revisioning, positioning theory was used as a lens to reinterpret the original data. As a result of this reanalysis, the varying positions of a foster mother (the child's biological grandmother), student (her male foster child), and researcher are described. The classroom contexts that the child experienced in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade are used as benchmarks for analysis. The results show that the foster mother most often positioned herself as a leader or expert, the child positioned himself as a successful student, and the researcher was positioned by these two as a recipient of information.

Abstract = {Examined the readability of an existing stroke brochure and illustrated how the readability of patient education materials may be improved. Stroke education information from the Australian National Stroke Foundation was assessed for readability using three formulas: Flesch reading ease, Statistical Measure of Gobbledegook (SMOG), and the Fry readability graph. A Flesch reading ease score indicated that the brochure was in the "standard" to "fairly difficult" reading range. The results of the Fry and SMOG index assessments indicated that a reading level of 10th and 11th grades were required to comprehend the brochure information. Revision of a randomly selected portion of text using established guidelines for writing patient information, and subsequent reanalysis, showed that simple revisions to health literature can dramatically improve readability. For example, the Flesch reading ease score of the original version of the text required a reading grade level of 12; in the revised version a grade level of 5 was required. Given the importance of effective communication of prevention information about stroke, these results are presented as a model of how future revisions of difficult to read stroke-related literature might be conducted to improve public education.

Abstract = {J. Pratt, T. M. Spalek, and F. Bradshaw (1999) recently proposed that attentional momentum is the mechanism underlying the inhibition of return (IOR) effect. They suggested that momentum associated with an attentional movement away from a peripherally cued location and toward an uncued opposite location is essential and fundamental to the finding of an IOR effect. Although it is clear from the present study and from a reanalysis of data from Pratt et al. that response time can be facilitated at an uncued opposite location, this putative effect of attentional momentum is neither robust nor reliable. First, it occurs for only a minority of participants. Second, it occurs in only a subset of the cued display positions. And finally, it is uncorrelated with the occurrence of IOR. Together the data indicate that the attentional momentum hypothesis is an overgeneralization and that it does not underlie the robust and reliable IOR effect.

Abstract = {Anxiety sensitivity is the fear of anxiety-related sensations, and is measured by the 16-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; S. Reiss et al, 1986). Despite the popularity and utility of the ASI in research, studies have provided evidence for the inadequacy of several items, and item-to-scale correlations for the ASI have not been published. In this study, a converging set of analyses to evaluate the item adequacy and factor structure of the ASI was used. Ss were 340 psychiatric outpatients and 50 nonpatients. Results of these multiple analyses converged nicely suggesting that Items 1, 5, 7, 8, and 13 should be considered for removal from the instrument. The impact of removing these problematic items from the scale was explored through the reanalysis of data from 3 studies (S. G. Ball et al, 1995; M. Eke and R. J. McNally, 1996; and N. B. Schmidt et al, 1997) that compared the original ASI with the new 11-item version (the ASI minus the 5 problematic items). Results suggest that the 2 scales function comparably in many respects but that the new version may be a more precise measure of anxiety sensitivity. The 11-item ASI appears to tap 2 primary aspects of anxiety sensitivity: fears of somatic sensations of anxiety and fears of loss of mental control.

Abstract = {Developed a brief form of the Life Skills Profile (LSP) that incorporates all 5 subscales of the full form. A new short form of the LSP (LSP-20) was developed to incorporate all 5 subscales of the full form. The LSP-20 development was based on a reanalysis of data from previously published studies. These data sets were also reanalyzed to determine any differential effects of numbers and percentages of items in the LSP-39, LSP-16 and LSP-20, comparability of scores of the different forms, of test-retest and interrater reliability, and validity of the LSP-20 by comparison with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A 20-item short form of the LSP-39 (LSP-20) is described which retains 16 items of an earlier short form but which also reproduces the subscale concerned with disability associated with positive psychotic phenomena. The subscales correlated highly with their counterparts in the full form, interrater and test-retest reliabilities were comparable, and concurrent validity was good.

Abstract = {The traumatic process contains three possible stages: a stage of warning, a stage of impact (immediate reaction), and a post-traumatic stage. While identification of factors that can influence the long term clinical picture (the post-traumatic stage) has been attempted elsewhere, examination has not previously been done to explore the relationship between the severity of stressors and the immediate stress reaction. This paper proposes that gradations of stress (intensity, duration) play a key role at the stage of impact (immediate reaction), which subsequently affects both the short and long-term clinical picture. It also proposes that behavior under threat (reaction to stress) is usually an adaptive behavior, a communication, a part of a dialogue between the survivor and the surrounding environment. In this study, immediate stress reaction was measured in terms of CSR, or combat stress reactions. CSR is defined as a means by which soldiers communicate to the system that they cannot take it any more. CSR symptoms can present clinically in a variety of ways, as psychiatric reactions, accidents, somatic illnesses, behavioral acting out or conduct disorders. Reanalysis of a longitudinal study of 4000 soldiers in World War II was conducted, and the question “what kind of objective stress precedes each type of CSR casualties” was asked. Results indicated that gradations of stress at the stage of impact significantly influenced the clinical picture. Intensive combat typically produced psychiatric casualties and accidents. Moderate Stress tended to result in medical casualties; and prolonged, intermittent combat preceded AWOL and disciplinary manpower drain. A study in Israel, which I conducted after the 1982 war, showed similar results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Recent neuroimaging studies of language processing are examining the neural substrate of phonology because of its critical role in mapping sound information onto higher levels of language processing (e.g., words) as well as providing codes in which verbal information can be temporarily stored in working memory. However, the precise role of the inferior frontal cortex in spoken and written phonological tasks has remained elusive. Although lesion studies have indicated the presence of selective deficits in phonological processing, the location of lesions underlying these impairments has not revealed a consistent pattern. Despite efforts to refine methods and tasks, functional neuroimaging studies have also revealed variability in activation patterns. Reanalysis of evidence from these neuroimaging studies suggests that there are functional subregions within the inferior frontal gyrus that correspond to specific components of phonological processing (e.g., orthographic to phonological conversion in reading, and segmentation in speech).

Abstract = {Z. L. Lu and G. Sperling (1995) proposed that human visual motion perception is served by 3 separate motion systems: a 1st-order system that responds to moving luminance patterns, a 2nd-order system that responds to moving modulations of feature types--stimuli in which the expected luminance is the same everywhere but an area of higher contrast or of flicker moves, and a 3rd-order system that computes the motion of marked locations in a salience map. Subsequently, there have been some strongly confirmatory reports: different gain-control mechanisms for 1st- and 2nd-order motion, selective impairment of 1st- vs 2nd- and/or 3rd-order motion by different brain injuries, and the classification of new 3rd-order motions. Various procedures have successfully discriminated between 2nd- and 3rd-order motion (when 1st-order motion is excluded): dual tasks, 2nd-order reversed phi, motion competition, and selective adaptation. Meanwhile, 8 apparent contradictions to the 3-systems theory have been proposed. A review and reanalysis here of the new evidence, pro and con, resolves the challenges and yields a more clearly defined and significantly strengthened theory.

Abstract = {Together, the results of 3 studies examining heart rate reactivity (HRR) in male batterers do not provide strong support for the I M. Gottman et al (see record [rid]2001-11319-004[/rid]) batterer typology. All research groups found similar proportions of severely violent male batterers who show heart rate increases or decreases during a marital conflict discussion, but there was inconsistent validation of this taxonomy on variables of interest. This difference was also found among less violent and nonviolent men. The authors believe HRR may be useful for differentiating batterers on the dimension of anger-hostility but are less optimistic that HRR will reliably identify psychopathic or antisocial batterers. The authors do not agree that low levels of marital interaction conflict led to their failure to replicate. Reanalysis of data from I C. Meehan, A. Holtzworth-Munroe, and K. Herron (2001) suggests baseline artifacts may be an important determinant of HRR differences. Methodological changes may improve the reliability of HRR assessment.

Abstract = {Eye fixations during reading were monitored to examine the relationship between individual differences in working memory capacity—assessed by the reading span task—and inferences about predictable events. Context sentences predicting likely events, or non-predicting control sentences, were presented. They were followed by continuation sentences in which a target word represented an event to be inferred (inferential word) or an unlikely event (non-predictable word). A main effect of reading span showed that high working memory capacity was related to shorter gaze durations across sentence regions. More specific findings involved an interaction between context, target, and reading span on late processing measures and regions. For high- but not for low-span readers, the predicting condition, relative to the control condition, facilitated reanalysis of the continuation sentence representing the inference concept. This effect was revealed by a reduction in regression-path reading time in the last region of the sentence, involving less time reading that region and fewer regressions from it. Results show that working memory facilitates elaborative inferences during reading, but that this occurs at late text-integration processes, rather than at early lexical-access processes.

Abstract = {Affective disorders are characterized by first a high recurrence risk, second a 30-50 times increased suicide risk and third a 2- to 3 times increased overall mortality. In contrast to a populistic belief no scientific evidence exists that antidepressant treatment, particularly long-term treatment, could reduce the the risk of suicidal acts in depressive patients with a history of suicide attempts. Data, however, coming from international, systematic, retrospective analyses of well-documented long-term courses of illness in reliably diagnosed patients, and from a large national, prospective long-term trial on the prophylactic efficacy of lithium versus carbamazepine and amitriptyline has accumulated in the last 10-15 years strongly supporting a (possibly specific) antisuicidal effect of lithium. The large collaborative IGSLI study (International Group for the Study of Lithium-treated Patients) covering 5,616 patient years clearly showed that adequate long-term lithium treatment significantly reduces and even normalizes the excess mortality of patients with affective disorders. A metaanalysis on 17,000 patients pooled from 28 studies demonstrated that the rate of suicidal acts is 8.6 fold higher in patients without lithium as compared to those with regular lithium treatment. A post-hoc analysis of a large multicenter, controlled long-term trial found no suicidal acts in 146 patients randomized to lithium compared to 9 suicidal acts in 139 patients randomized to carbamazepine. Reanalysis of the data from the IGSLI study supports the concept of the specificity of lithium, i.e., evidence could be provided that lithium also reduces suicidal behavior in patients who do not benefit from the lithium treatment in terms of episode reduction. Conclusion: Lithium has to be considered as a first line mood stabilizer in affective disorders, particularly in patients with a history of suicide attempts. Extreme caution is required when lithium is discontinued or a patient is switched to another mood stabilizer, because such a patient might have been protected against suicidal impulses in spite of an incomplete response as to the number and quality of depressive/manic episodes.

Abstract = {Notes that fiction in literature can assist in the analysis of therapeutic and ethical dilemmas in psychotherapy. Lying on the Couch (1997), I. D. Yalom's account of Dr. Seymour Trotter and Mrs. Belle Felini's therapeutic encounter, describes a complex series of issues and dilemmas. In the present article, a reanalysis of the case from the perspective of a clinical and ethical consultation is presented. The therapeutic crisis that preceded the sexual relationship and the initial presentation of the client are considered in detail. Following the discussion of each of these periods, alternative modes of understanding and intervening in the treatment are presented. It is maintained that the in-depth exploration of a fictional case such as this one allows therapists to critically evaluate the decisions that underlie problems in the therapeutic encounter. The article concludes with specific recommendations for clinical and ethical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the processes involved in the recovery from temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 18 college students read German subject–object ambiguous relative and complement clauses. As both clause types are initially analyzed as subject-first structures, object-first structures require a revision which is more difficult for complement than for relative clauses. The hypothesis is tested that the revision process consists of two sub-processes, namely diagnosis and actual reanalysis. Applying a spatio-temporal principal component analysis to the ERP data, distinct positive subcomponents presumably reflecting different subprocesses could be identified in the time range of the P300 and P600. It will be argued that the P600 is not a monolithic component, and that different subprocesses may be involved at varying time points depending on the type of garden-path sentence.

Abstract = {This study estimated the economic consequences of autism in the UK, based on published evidence and on the reanalysis of data holdings at the Centre for the Economics of Mental Health. With an assumed prevalence of 5 per 10,000, the annual societal cost for the UK was estimated to exceed £ 1 billion. The lifetime cost for a person with autism exceeded £ 2.4 million. The main costs were for living support and day activities. The authors note that family costs account for only 2.3 percent of the total cost, but a lack of relevant information limited their ability to estimate these costs. Minor improvements in life outcome for people with autism could substantially reduce costs over the lifetime. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a controlled trial, the β-adrenoceptor/5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist pindolol accelerated and enhanced the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine. Ss were 132 patients (mean age 43.3 yrs) with major depression. The median times to sustained response were 19 days for fluoxetine plus pindolol and 29 days for fluoxetine plus placebo. The response rate at endpoint was 16% greater in Ss treated with the combination. The plasma concentration of pindolol remained stable between 3 days and 6 wks. Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations increased steadily until the 4th wk of treatment. Fluoxetine concentrations were lower in Ss receiving the combination, but there was no significant relationship to the clinical response in either group. A reanalysis of the data using a survival analysis revealed that significant differences in the time to sustained response between both groups would have also been detected (1) in a 2-wk trial, (2) without a placebo lead-in phase, and (3) with less frequent visits. However, the use of "response" instead of "sustained response" as measure of clinically relevant change would have greatly diminished the difference between treatment arms.

Abstract = {Background: The tinnitus questionnaire of Goebel and Hiller (1998) measures the impairment due to tinnitus with six partially correlating factors. These are based, among other things, on constructs of information-processing such as irrational concepts, over-generalization and attitudes of helplessness. Objective: In this paper a reanalysis of the tinnitus questionnaire was carried out, taking into account its item characteristics. Methods: The tinnitus questionnaire was given to a random sample of 153 patients and results were examined according to classical test-theory criteria. Results: In a factor analysis one factor of impairment by tinnitus was extracted, which showed an acceptable coefficient of reliability and significant correlations with the closely connected dimensions such as depression, general physical condition and locus of control. Conclusions: These results show that the short version of the tinnitus questionnaire is an adequate instrument for measuring of tinnitus-related impairments, that conforms to the usual criteria for psychometric tests.

Abstract = {Discusses research that determined the weights of the 2nd-stage mechanisms of the visual system by psychophysical and electrophysiological means. Quantitative reanalysis of the results of habituation experiments demonstrate the existence of higher-order mechanisms that respond to the sums of the signals from 2nd-stage mechanisms. Diverse evidence from other psychophysical experiments including detection and discrimination of chromatic pulses, and coherence of plaid patterns, confirm the existence of higher-order mechanisms. Studies of the influence of the chromatic content of stimuli on vernier acuity and motion thresholds and on temporal modulation sensitivity support the conjecture that, while chromatic stimuli are processed solely by the parvocellular system, luminance stimuli are processed by both magno- and parvocellular neurons.

Abstract = {Eye fixations were recorded to assess whether, how, and when readers draw inferences about predictable events. Predicting context sentences, or non-predicting control sentences, were presented to 40 college students, followed by continuation sentences in which a target word referred to a predictable event (inferential word) or an unlikely event (non-predictable word). Results show that there were no effects on initial target word processing measures, such as launch and landing sites, fixation probability, first-fixation duration, or first-pass reading time. However, relative to the control condition, the predicting context (1) speeded up reanalysis of the inferential word, as revealed by a reduction in second-pass reading time and regressions, and (2) interfered with processing of the non-predictable word, as shown by an increase in regressions. These results indicate that predictive inferences are active at late text integration processes, rather than at early lexical-access processes. The pattern of findings suggests that these inferences involve initial activation of rather general concepts following the inducing context, and that they are completed or refined with delay, after the inferential target word is read. Examples of experimental passages are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Presents data supporting a (possibly specific) antisuicidal effect of lithium (LI). The IGSLI study (International Group for the Study of Lithium-treated Patients) covering 5,616 patient years clearly showed that adequate long-term LI treatment significantly reduces and even normalizes the excess mortality of patients with affective disorders (ADs). A metaanalysis on 17,000 Ss pooled from 28 studies showed that the rate of suicidal acts is 8.6 fold higher in Ss without LI compared to those with regular LI treatment. A post-hoc analysis of a large multicenter, controlled long-term trial found no suicidal acts in 146 Ss randomized to LI compared to 9 suicidal acts in 139 Ss randomized to carbamazepine. Reanalysis of the data from the IGSLI study supports the concept of the specificity of LI, i.e., evidence could be provided that LI also reduces suicidal behavior in patients who do not benefit from the LI treatment in terms of episode reduction. LI has to be considered as a first line mood stabilizer in ADs, particularly in patients with a history of suicide attempts. Extreme caution is required when LI is discontinued or a patient is switched to another mood stabilizer, because such a patient might have been protected against suicidal impulses in spite of an incomplete response.

Abstract = {Examined the relationship between leftward bias and accidents in India and Japan. 418 undergraduate and graduate students (mean ages 17.7 and 20.0 yrs) residing in India and 697 Ss (mean ages 19.1 and 19.3 yrs) residing in Japan completed the Side Bias Questionnaire and other questionnaires concerning the frequency of accidents committed during daily activities. Results show that these Ss did not differ in terms of leftwardness for any of the forms of side bias. Left-handers were found to commit more accidents in India but not in Japan. Reanalysis of data in terms of left-handedness, mixed-handedness, and right-handedness indicated that mixed handers committed more accidents than extreme handers in Japan but not in India. It is concluded that left-handed Ss do not necessarily commit more accidents than right-handed ones. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {According to the authors, the incremental validity of Rorschach and MMPI data has not been adequately established, nor has any study to date explored the incremental validity of these tests for predicting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) personality disorders (PDs). In a reanalysis of existing data, the authors used select Rorschach variables and the MMPI PD scales to predict Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic PD criteria in a sample of 57 treatment-seeking outpatients (mean age 28 yrs). The correlational findings revealed a limited relation between Rorschach and MMPI-2 variables, with only 5 of 30 correlations reaching significance (p < .05). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that both the MMPI and Rorschach data add incrementally in the prediction of DSM-IV borderline and narcissistic PD total criteria scores. The findings were less clear for the incremental value of Rorschach and MMPI-2 data in predicting the total number of DSM-IV histrionic PD criteria, which were best predicted by Rorschach data, and antisocial PD criteria, which were best predicted by MMPI-2 data. In addition to providing evidence of the incremental validity of Rorschach data, these findings also shed light on the psychological characteristics of the DSM-IV Cluster B PDs.

Response generalization takes two forms: generalization of treatment effects to untrained exemplars of trained behaviors and generalization to untrained  behaviors. In the past, response generalization has not been extensive and typically has been restricted to untrained exemplars of trained behaviors. Reasons for these findings are discussed with reference to recent advances in the understanding of the nature of AOS and to theories of speech motor control and learning. The discussion focuses on the influence of the theoretical basis used to develop hypotheses and select behaviors to test predictions, the complexity of the treatment task/s, and patient characteristics.

Abstract = {Research on interpersonal complementarity has been beset by various methodological problems, including the lack of a consistent and theoretically coherent measurement approach for quantifying and statistically evaluating effects. The purpose of this article is to propose and demonstrate such a method, one that is integrative with interpersonal circumplex models of behavior and that also provides a means for establishing statistical significance levels in relation to an appropriate base-rate model. Two demonstrations of the method are reported. The first study involves an analysis of mother-self relationship data and is based on L. S. Benjamin's (1994) Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) system; the second study, which is based on the Interpersonal Circle Model (IPC), is a reanalysis of peer interaction data originally presented by S. R. Strong et al. (1988). The results were supportive of theoretical predictions for both the SASB and IPC models. The present method has advantages for testing and refining theory and, with its tie to the circumplex model, makes salient several problematic issues for complementarity research.

Studies conducted of US schools during in 1966 by J. S. Coleman and his associates and schools of other countries by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement concluded that student performance was determined more by family background than by school characteristics. However, Coleman himself later recanted that finding in a reanalysis of international studies. Recent international studies of student assessment have demonstrated that between-countries differences in how the science and mathematics curriculum is presented may account for differences in student performance. This finding has had an effect on national policy by supporting efforts to reform the content of subject matter introduced in schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper presents findings from a European collaborative study. A common framework for reanalysis of existing data was devised. Alcohol-related problems encountered were classified as "internal" and "external." Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to predict lifetime presence of any internal problem, any external problem, and any problem at all. The predictor variables were gender, life stage (corresponding roughly to young, middle, and older age), past year's drinking level in 4 categories of grams of alcohol per month, and past year's "binge" drinking. All 4 predictor variables were associated with the presence of alcohol-related problems, with women and retired people having fewer problems and heavy drinkers and binge drinkers having more. At all levels of alcohol consumption, men were more likely than women to experience at least one adverse consequence. Internal problems were more common than external problems. Country differences are discussed and recommendations are made for further studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {It is still a controversial issue whether the human sentence processor computes syntactic representations serially or in parallel. The authors address this question by comparing the processing of different types of ambiguous garden path sentences with the processing of corresponding ungrammatical sentences. The ungrammatical sentences lead to the same type of syntactic mismatch that arises in the garden path sentences at the point of disambiguation, but they cannot be reanalyzed. Using the speeded grammaticality judgement task it is shown that factors which regulate garden path strength in ambiguous sentences also have an influence on the processing of corresponding ungrammatical sentences in that they determine how reliably the ungrammaticality is detected. The authors argue that this processing correlation provides evidence for serial parsing models because only serial models lead us to expect that the parser attempts reanalysis in ambiguous and ungrammatical sentences alike.

Abstract = {Clinicians and researchers applying the transtheoretical model (J. O. Prochaska, C.C. DiClemente, & J.C. Norcross, 1992) to health promotion often assume that relationships of processes and stages observed in smoking cessation can be generalized to other problems. A reanalysis of 47 cross-sectional studies determined that use of change processes varies by stage, but the sequencing of processes is not consistent across health problems. In smoking cessation, cognitive processes were used in earlier stages than were behavioral processes. In exercise adoption and diet change, use of behavioral and cognitive processes increased together. Results for substance abuse and psychotherapy were less consistent. Substituting new behaviors, making a commitment, considering consequences, seeking information, controlling cues, and using rewards varied most by stage. Future longitudinal studies should assess these processes as potential mediators of lifestyle change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Performed a qualitative and quantitative reanalysis of the Six Cultures data on children's play, collected in the 1950s, to revisit worlds of childhood during a time when sample communities were more isolated from mass markets and media than they are today. A count was performed of 140 children (aged 3–10 yrs) in each community sample scored as engaging in creative-constructive play, fantasy play, role play, and games with rules. Results showed that children from Kenya and India scored lowest overall, those from the Philippines and Mexico scored intermediate, and those from Japan and the US scored highest. It is concluded that cultural norms and opportunities—or whether adults encouraged work versus play, children had freedom for exploration and motivation to practice adult roles through play, and the environment provided easy access to models and materials for creative and constructive play—determined how the kinds of play were stimulated.

Abstract = {Tested the hypothesis that negative psychological reactions to job relocation would be a function of 1) number of relocation problems, and (2) making pessimistic attributions for relocation problems (that is, the tendency to attribute negative events to internal, stable and global causes). Furthermore, it was predicted that these factors should interact, such that individuals with many relocation problems who also make pessimistic attributions will experience the worst psychological reactions. The results from a cross-sectional survey of 93 relocators (mean age 37.5 yrs) supported these predictions. As expected, those relocators who had many relocation problems and made pessimistic attributions reported the worst mental health and relocation-specific stress. In addition, a reanalysis of a longitudinal study of relocators by Martin (see record [rid]1996-00266-006[/rid]) also supported the above predictions using attributions of perceived control. Furthermore, the relocators predicted to be most at risk (many problems/low control) reported the worst changes in mental health during the course of the move.

Silberschatz et al (1986), who developed a method to assess the compatibility between an interpretation and a patient's psychology, and demonstrated that this factor—plan compatibility—may contribute to an interpretation's effect. In their reassessing of the data the authors demonstrate that raters can reliably distinguish content from process in evaluating plan compatibility. They also demonstrate that a distinction between content and process plan compatibility may increase the amount of explained variance in Patient Experiencing scores. Of particular interest is an analysis of interpretations in which the aspects of plan compatibility (content or process) differed, which showed that the aspect of plan compatibility most highly correlated with Experiencing varied across the cases. This finding suggests that attention to the distinct contributions of content and process to plan compatibility may help further our understanding of how individual patients listen to and utilize therapist interventions.

This article performs a reanalysis of the S. Kety et al (1968) spectrum concept for the purpose of determining whether it is a valid construct. On the basis of quantitative and historical evidence, as well as on theoretical concerns, it is determined that the spectrum concept as defined by Kety et al is not valid and that chronic schizophrenia is the only diagnosis that should have been used in the Danish-American adoption studies. The results and conclusions of these studies therefore are called into question. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this study, event-related brain potential effects of speech processing are obtained and compared to similar effects in sentence reading. In 2 experiments sentences were presented that contained 3 different types of grammatical violations. In Exp 1 (n = 32) sentences were presented word by word at a rate of 4 words per second. The grammatical violations elicited a Syntactic Positive Shift (P600/SPS), 500 ms after the onset of the word that rendered the sentence ungrammatical. The P600/SPS consisted of 2 phases, an early phase with a relatively equal anterior posterior distribution and a later phase with a strong posterior distribution. The authors interpreted the 1st phase as an indication of structural integration complexity, and the 2nd phase as an indication of failing parsing operations and/or an attempt at reanalysis. In Exp 2 (n =30 ) the same syntactic violations were presented in sentences spoken at a normal rate and with normal intonation. These violations elicited a P600/SPS with the same onset as was observed for the reading of these sentences. In addition 2 of the 3 violations showed a preceding frontal negativity, most clearly over the left hemisphere. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present article argues that concordant and complementary identification are ubiquitous in the organization of experience and in human relationships, and that insufficient attention has been given to the role that these identifications play in the treatment process. Self psychology and projective identification were critiqued in relation to how they either avoid recognition of complementarity or reduce complementarity to concordance. The article concludes with a reanalysis of the patient–nurse relationship in Ingmar Bergman's Persona, dynamics that had been previously described by Otto Kernberg (1975) as projective identification and critiqued by Robert D.

However, it has also been shown that CA increases as recall level increases and that CA scores following relational processing are actually below CA scores for randomly recalled items. These results prompted M. D. Murphy (1979) to suggest that, after adjusting for recall-level differences, relational processing decreases CA scores. Results of Experiment 1, along with a reanalysis of previously published data, showed that relational processing produces lower CA scores than purely item-specific processing (or random recall), but an increase in relational processing produces an increase in CA scores even when the CA and IPC scores are adjusted for recall-level differences. These results suggest a curvilinear relationship between relational processing and CA scores. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

His body of research was a major part of the empirical foundation on which the scientific community judged behavioral couple therapy (or behavioral marital therapy) as the most widely researched treatment for couples and as the only couple treatment reaching the highest level of empirical support. Although Neil did not invent the concept of clinically significant change, he was the first to operationally define it in statistical terms. In the article Variability in outcome and clinical significance of behavioral marital therapy: A reanalysis of outcome data (see record [rid]1984-32021-001[/rid]), Neil and his colleagues developed a metric that has gained widespread acceptance in the broader area of outcome research. Yet Neil's lasting contribution is not just the development of a metric for assessing clinical significance, but also the emphasis he put on clinical significance. Neil's work not only caught the attention of the scientific community, it changed it in important ways. His work changed how we do therapy and how we evaluate therapy.

Abstract = {Describes the technical aspects of 2 arrival-time-differences methods used to locate vocalizing bowhead whales during the spring migration. The results of a field calibration test conducted in situ in 1985 during the bowhead whale migration are provided. The 1985 calibration data and a sample of 217 bowhead calls from 1988 were reanalyzed and used as the basis for comparing and evaluating the reliability of the 2 methods. In the 1st location method (the old method, used in 1984–1986, and 1988) arrival-time difference was estimated by cross correlation of filtered spectrograms. In the 2nd method (the new method, used in 1992–1993), arrival-time difference was estimated by cross correlation of filtered waveforms from pairs of hydrophones. The reanalysis shows that (1) the 2 methods yield similar range distributions, with differences in range estimates increasing as the distance to the vocalizing whale increased, and (2) the range errors associated with location were 4 times smaller and bearing errors were 3 times smaller with the new method. Overall, both methods had approximately the same bias in location estimates. The calibration results show that the new method yielded locations with less variability but only slightly less bias than locations using the old method.

In this commentary, the authors begin by illustrating how the lessons presented by Campos et al can be helpful for the study of temperament. Additionally, the authors take issue with the distinctions raised by Campos et al between experience and biological causes of change. The changes in perceptual abilities and emotional behaviors that Campos et al outline are necessarily the product of brain–behavior interactions. It is possible that the nervous system must be readied for such experiences to have their desired effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Campos et al (see record [rid]2001-07897-001[/rid]) that provides a comprehensive review and reanalysis of the consequences of self-produced locomotor experience. Specifically, the authors focused on the role of locomotor experience in changes in social and emotional development, referential gestural communication, wariness of heights, the perception of self-motion, distance perception, spatial search, and spatial coding strategies. According to the author of this comment, what makes the Campos et al article important is the concept of psychological explanation that it provides. This article consists of 2 sections: The 1st is focused on earlier theories and explanations of development. The Campos et al concepts of causes and explanations build on earlier works, and the author relates them to 3 sets of ideas about the causes of development that emerged about 25 yrs ago. The 2nd section is an illustration of how the Campos et al concepts of causality apply to the author's own work linking the visual experiences available during locomotion to the development of dynamic spatial orientation when walking without vision.

In this commentary, the author notes the virtues of the Campos et al article, yet criticizes it because its strong emphasis on locomotor experience as an agent of change seems to sharpen several distinctions that developmental psychologists have been working hard to blur. The first of these is the well-known "nature vs nurture" dichotomy. Another element of progress that seems to have been lost in the Campos et al article has to do with the direction of causality. Another line that Campos et al draw too clearly is that between active and passive experiences. The author concludes that Campos et al lead us down a very interesting path, but they have portrayed it as deceptively straight and narrow.

In this reply, the author praises Campos et al for their confrontation of what she sees as both the most troubling, and ultimately, the most liberating aspect of systems approaches to development. In linear or single-cause explanations, the dependent and the independent variables are clearly identified, and the causal chains are statistically established. It should seem straightforward to test whether self-produced locomotion causes the shift from self-referent to environmental referent strategies; however, as Campos et al show, it is not so simple. The author notes that regardless of the details of locomotion and spatial search, Campos et al write a powerful treatise in support of cognitive embodiment.

Abstract = {The onset of locomotion heralds one of the major life transitions in early development and involves a pervasive set of changes in perception, spatial cognition, and social and emotional development. Through a synthesis of published and hitherto unpublished findings, gathered from a number of converging research designs and methods, this article provides a comprehensive review and reanalysis of the consequences of self-produced locomotor experience. Specifically, the authors focus on the role of locomotor experience in changes in social and emotional development, referential gestural communication, wariness of heights, the perception of self-motion, distance perception, spatial search, and spatial coding strategies. Analysis reveals new insights into the specific processes by which locomotor experience brings about psychological changes. The authors elaborate these processes and provide new predictions about previously unsuspected links between locomotor experience and psychological function. The authors conclude that, in infancy, the onset of locomotor experience brings about widespread consequences, and after infancy, can be responsible for an enduring role in development by maintaining and updating existing skills.

In her meta-analysis, West systematically excluded nonsignificant results. West located 12 studies on detecting sexual abuse and 4 studies on detecting physical abuse. The authors reanalyzed only the data from West's 12 studies on sexual abuse. New effect sizes were calculated using the nonsignificant and significant results. The authors conclude that projective techniques should not be used to detect child sexual abuse. Many of the studies purportedly demonstrating validity were flawed, and none of the projective test scores had been well replicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Presents the design, implementation and simulation results of a psycholinguistic model of human syntactic processing that meets major empirical criteria. The parser operates in conjunction with a lexicalist grammar and is driven by syntactic information associated with heads of phrases. The dynamics of the model are based on competition by lateral inhibition. Input words activate lexical frames in the mental lexicon, and a network of candidate 'unification links' is set up between frame nodes. These links represent tentative attachments that are graded rather than all-or-none. Candidate links that, due to grammatical or 'treehood' constraints, are incompatible, compete for inclusion in the final syntactic tree by sending each other inhibitory signals that reduce the competitor's attachment strength. The outcome of these local and simultaneous competitions is controlled by dynamic parameters. Simulations are reported of a significant range of psycholinguistic parsing phenomena in both normal and aphasic speakers of English: (i) various effects of linguistic complexity; (ii) effects of local and global ambiguity, and of word-class and syntactic ambiguity; (iii) certain difficulty-of-reanalysis effects; and (iv) effects of agrammatism on parsing performance.

Abstract = {Responds to comments by P. England et al (see record [rid]2000-05422-009[/rid]) on the article by T. Tam (see record [rid]1997-04649-001[/rid]), which investigated 2 competing hypotheses (devaluation and specialized human capital) of the wage effects of occupational sex composition in the US. It is noted that the punch line of the England et al analysis is that the addition of just 1 independent variable (general educational development, GED) completely changes the results and restores the conclusion that there is a wage disadvantage for occupations with a higher percentage of females. However, a careful review of their tables reveals that the new support for the devaluation hypothesis (DEVH) is weak even in the GED models, especially in light of sampling error, the remarkably coherent evidence against the DEVH in the original article, and the likelihood that the GED models may be misspecified. Further, England et al make no attempt in their reanalysis to correct for measurement error in their variables. It is suggested that the structure of this measurement error probably induces a bias in the sex composition coefficient in a direction that would appear to support the DEVH.

Abstract = {The present paper reports a reanalysis of N. Beschin and I. H. Robertson's (1997) data, using additional control Ss, and a formula which characterizes personal neglect as a lateral bias of behavior rather than as a lateralised deficit. 81 Ss took part in this study: 17 were right brain damaged patients with extrapersonal neglect (mean age 65.1 yrs), 14 were right brain damaged patients without extrapersonal neglect (mean age 64.4 yrs), 13 were left brain damaged patients (mean age 63.2 yrs) and 44 were age-matched controls (mean age 66.2 yrs). Extrapersonal neglect was diagnosed if patients showed neglect impairment on any of 6 standardized tests, and the comb and razor test was conducted. It is shown that this formula greatly enhances the test's sensitivity to the behavioral abnormalities of brain damaged patients, and it is recommended that this modification be adopted for the future diagnosis of personal neglect.

Abstract = {Past research has shown that attitudes can be based on different types of psychological information or components. It has also been suggested that the amount of ambivalence and inconsistency between and within these components are important aspects of attitude structure. In this paper, the authors discuss the relation between ambivalence and inconsistency, and the effects on message processing. To test predictions about the independence of ambivalence and inconsistency, the authors reanalyzed the data from their previous experiment (G. R. Maio et al, 1996; see record [rid]1996-06722-001[/rid]). The new analyses focused on intercomponent ambivalence and attiduinal inconsistency, in addition to intracomponent ambivalence. Using open-ended measures, the authors calculated indices of ambivalence and inconsistency within Canadian college students' attitudes toward Oriental people. The relations between these constructs were then examined, as were their effects on the processing of strong and weak persuasive messages advocating immigration from Hong Kong. Based on past theorizing and research, and on reanalyses of data, the authors conclude that ambivalence and inconsistency are distinct constructs, which are empirically unrelated and produce different effects on message processing.

Abstract = {Although the fledgling psychology of 100 years ago was assertively empirical, there were no inferential statistics to guide psychologists' data analyses. However, l9th-century developments had left psychology with a rich array of techniques for analyzing and presenting data, some of which remain underutilized today. These include comparisons across replications, within-subject designs, reanalyses of data, analyses of factorial designs, and especially the use of tables and graphs. As the merits of hypothesis-testing statistics are debated at the turn of the 21st century, the history of data-handling practices can remind psychologists that there are many ways to overcome the current uniformity of statistical practice.

Abstract = {When the interest is in making statements about change based on repeated measurements of discrete data, e.g., brand-switching data, one way to do so is by using Markov chain models. This article presents a hierarchy of such models that is very flexible in overcoming drawbacks of the simple Markov chain model by simultaneously including and allowing to test separately for stationarity, order of the process, heterogeneity and unreliability. A reanalysis of the Snow Crop brand-switching data reveals heterogeneity and unreliability to be relevant, ruling out nonstationarity and higher order dependence though models of the latter type fare well in terms of goodness-of-fit. The higher order issue is addressed in detail by reporting results from recovery studies ending up with a caveat about using higher order models.

The 1st study reports the observations of 15 adults with developmental disability when a normal rocking chair and an identical chair made stationary is placed in their home environment. The 2nd study observed the same individuals over a 21 mo period to ask what characteristics of body-rocking are clearly correlated over time. The 3rd study compared measures of body-rocking used throughout the paper, but also the collateral behaviors introduced in Exp 2. 21 college students who engage in habitual body-rocking were compared to 15 adults with mental retardation who also engage in more body-rocking. The 4th study was a reanalysis of Study 1. The results indicate that rocking chairs are not necessarily preferred by people with mental retardation, and that a rocking chair produces a higher amplitude of body-rocking. Stable idiosyncratic behaviors accompanying body-rocking also were described. Collateral behavior did not necessarily occur as part of a body-rocking complex. The results also show that when compared with college students, people with mental retardation engage in body-rocking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Extracting a smaller number of factors than is statistically warranted tends to lead to instability of the results over different samples, especially for the smaller factors. For measuring the 8 factors proposed by Busato, however, the present 20 scales are not optimal. The aim of the present study was a reanalysis of the ILS on the item level to arrive at a better coverage of the 8 factors. The sample consisted of 963 psychology students. As predicted, an 8-factor solution proves to describe the global structure of the ILS best. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Research has suggested that these adolescents develop greater cultural acceptance; they have an increased openness to learning other languages; they generally are satisfied living abroad; they wish to maintain geographically mobile lives; and they are interested in future international careers. This reanalysis used data from the largest known study of internationally mobile 1,076 adolescents on 2 continents (M. Gerner et al 1992) with peers who have maintained residence in only 1 country throughout their lives. Findings support the impression of consistent gender differences. This analysis suggests the possibility that living abroad is a crucial experience to develop female interest in international careers. The largest and most meaningful differences in this study are between females who have lived abroad and both males and females who have not, and between females and males who have never lived abroad.

Accurate HBP was uncommon, but more prevalent among panic disorder patients than among healthy controls, depressed patients, patients with palpitations and individuals with infrequent panic attacks. No differences were found between panic disorder patients and patients with other anxiety disorders. Accurate perceivers had higher anxiety sensitivity scores than inaccurate perceivers. The data remain inconclusive as to whether perceived heart rate is correlated with anxiety in inaccurate perceivers. Physical exercise, distraction, variations in instructions and treatment each influenced HBP. However, the influence was different than previously thought. Finally, it is suggested that HBP may be understood in terms of schema-guided information processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on the article "Is Acupuncture Analgesia an Expectancy Effect," by Bausell et al (see record [rid]2005-01831-007[/rid]). This reanalysis of two sham controlled acupuncture trials showed that patients' beliefs about receiving either real or sham treatment were more important in determining the clinical outcome than any specific analgesic effect of the intervention. The best way to differentiate specific from nonspecific effects is to conduct placebo-controlled, preferably randomized trials. In many areas of medicine, we do not have a credible placebo. Patients' beliefs and expectations about osteopathy and an oral medication might differ. Expectations could significantly confound our results to the point of non-recognition. It follows that placebo control makes little sense without patient blinding. For dental pain, acupuncture was not better than sham, but patients' beliefs were a strong determinant of perceived pain. Even in conventional drug trials, beliefs and expectations created during the treatment period can confound the results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Used brain surface current density mapping in a standard brain model to identify statistically significant differences between activity of certain brain regions due to syntactically correct and incorrect auditory language input in 20 adult female native speakers of German. Activity in the first 600 msec after violation onset was mainly concentrated in the temporal cortex and the adjacent frontal and parietal areas of both hemispheres. Statistical analysis reveals significantly different activity mainly in both frontal and temporal cortices. For longer latencies above 250 msec, the differential activity was more prominent in the right hemisphere. Findings suggest right hemisphere involvement in auditory language processing. Right hemisphere regions may play a role in repair and reanalysis processes to free the specialized left hemisphere language areas for processing further input.

Abstract = {This study proposes a new control construct, harmony control (HC), inspired by a reanalysis of the F. Rothbaum et al (1982) primary and secondary control constructs. Traditional primary control, and its supporting construct secondary control, affirm the Western cultural emphasis on an agentic self that separates positively from others. Harmony control reflects an interdependent self-concept. In HC, people are flexible and adjusting, and they recognize the agency that resides in spiritual and social forces. Guided by culturally informed views of the interdependent self and previously defined categories of secondary control, the present research developed an individual difference measure of HC framed independently of traditional primary and secondary control. Results from over 2,300 community and student participants show that the scale meets traditional psychometric standards for reliability and predictive validity. As predicted, HC correlates with interdependence and collectivism and is orthogonal to 2 measures of traditional primary control. HC is uncorrelated with self-esteem, suggesting that HC may not engage self-efficacy because the social context is more in focus than the self.

Abstract = {Investigated a common and general basis for confidence in human judgment. Recently, the authors found that the properties of confidence judgments in the sensory domain mirror those previously established in the cognitive domain; they found underconfidence on easy sensory judgments and overconfidence on hard sensory judgments. In contrast, data from the Uppsala laboratory in Sweden suggest that sensory judgments are unique; a pervasive underconfidence bias was found, with overconfidence being evident only on very hard sensory judgments. H. Olsson and A. Winman (1996) attempted to resolve the debate on the basis of methodological issues related to features of the stimulus display in a visual discrimination task. A reanalysis of the data reported in J. V. Baranski and W. M. Petrusic (1994), together with the findings of a new experiment (15 Ss, mean age 31 yrs) that controlled stimulus display characteristics, supports the position that the difference between the Canadian and the Swedish data is real and, thus, may reflect cross-national differences in confidence in sensory discrimination.

Abstract = {Measured skin conductance (SCR) and finger pulse amplitude response (PULSE) in 53 schizophrenic, 30 manic and 28 control Ss to examine the orienting response (OR) dysfunction in severe psychiatric disorders. SCR and PULSE to neutral and task-relevant tones were measured in acutely ill inpatients and normal control Ss on 2 occasions separated by a 3-wk interval. There were no significant group differences in proportions of SCR and PULSE nonresponders to neutral tones. PULSE frequency to task-relevant tones in both the schizophrenic and manic patients was lower than that for controls in both OR sessions, but did not differ significantly between patient groups. Although PULSE frequency was inversely related to neuroleptic dose in the schizophrenic sample, reanalysis of unmedicated patients did not change the results. OR frequency to task-relevant but not to neutral tones exhibited test–retest reliability, Certain aspects of OR dysfunction may overlap in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The failure to demonstrate excessive OR nonresponding to neutral tones in schizophrenic patients is inconsistent with many previous studies but may be due to a high proportion of OR nonresponders among the control Ss.

The exception concerns aggressions of various kinds, which also show the greatest variability with age, gender, and culture.

Abstract = {The occurrence of different conspecific female color morphs, with one of the morphs resembling the male, is supposed to have consequences for mate choice. There are two hypotheses linking mate choice and female color polymorphism. First, males may mate predominantly with female morphs that differ from the male because they do not recognize androchrome females as females (male mimic hypothesis). Second, males may be more attracted to the most common morph in the population (habituation hypothesis). These hypotheses were tested in five populations of the same species, Ischnura elegans, with a range of androchrome frequencies. In each population binary choice experiments were performed in small cages. Males did not consistently prefer gynochrome females but mated predominantly with the most common morph in the population. Moreover, a reanalysis of the available damselfly data in the literature also supported the habituation hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The origins of sex differences in human behavior can lie mainly in evolved dispositions that differ by sex or mainly in the differing placement of women and men in the social structure. The present article contrasts these 2 origin theories of sex differences and illustrates the explanatory power of each to account for the overall differences between the mate selection preferences of men and women. Although this research area often has been interpreted as providing evidence for evolved dispositions, a reanalysis of D. M. Buss's (see record [rid]1989-32627-001[/rid]) study of sex differences in the attributes valued in potential mates in 37 cultures yielded cross-cultural variation that supports the social structural account of sex differences in mate preferences.

Abstract = {Bayesian reasoning can be improved by representing information in frequency formats rather than in probabilities. This thesis opens up applications in medicine, law, statistics education, and other fields. The beneficial effect is no longer in dispute, but rather its cause and its boundary conditions. C. Lewis and G. Keren (1999) argued that the effect of frequency formats is due to "joint statements" rather than to "frequency statements." However, they overlooked the fact that our thesis is about frequency formats, not just any kind of frequency statements. We show that joint statements alone cannot account for the effect. B. A. Mellers and A. P. McGraw (1999) proposed a boundary condition under which the beneficial effect is reduced. In a reanalysis of our original data, we found this reduction for the problem they used but not for any other problem. We conclude by summarizing results indicating that teaching frequency representations fosters insight into Bayesian reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In the years since I. L. Janis (1972) first identified the group pathology he termed groupthink, researchers have attempted to discover why groupthink occurs and what can be done to prevent it. Although most researchers have worked within Janis's original framework, the finding of C. McCauley (1989) that there seems to be two different social influence processes at work indicates that there may be a more complicated process at work. This article uses a self-regulatory model of motivation as a unifying framework to show how differing initial motivations on the part of group members combined with other antecedent factors can result in various processes that lead to groupthink. A historical reanalysis is given of the examination by Janis of the decision by the Kennedy administration to sanction the CIA-sponsored invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles, known as the Bay of Pigs.

Abstract = {Discusses the concept of "character" and the factors which permit psychoanalytic character alterations and many which mitigate against such change through reanalysis of 24 patients, all of whom had been in prior psychoanalysis over extended periods of time. Attempts to alter character in these cases provided significant obstacles, though symptoms might have been relieved and object relations may have improved as a result of the prior analyses. The author uses the concept of revenge in the organization of character as an isolated example of the problem of resistance to analyzing masochistic character, a partial paradigm which emphasizes how the complex developmental conflict structures can be organized as a self-contained theater of the mind to be replayed over and over. When the analyst tries to interrupt the performance, the patient as author of his own script fights back. Neurosis itself is treated as a self-created treasure, a work of personal art which denies editorial intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the processing of embedded clauses in German which are ambiguous between a subject-before-object and an object-before-subject order. Using a speeded grammaticality judgment task and 56 college students as Ss, 4 types of locally ambiguous clauses were compared: 1) sentences involving movement of a definite noun phrase; 2) sentences involving pronoun movement; 3) relative clauses; and 4) embedded questions. Analysis found that readers were consistently garden-pathed in the object-before-subject condition, regardless of sentence type. Furthermore, there were considerable differences with respect to garden-path strength. The garden-path effect was strongest for sentences involving scrambling. In addition, sentences involving pronoun movement induced more processing difficulty than embedded questions and relative clauses. The authors argue that the findings can be best explained within a serial processing model that acknowledges both syntactic and nonsyntactic influences on reanalysis and that can account for graded effects of garden-path strength.

Meyer (1999) argued that Hom et al overstated support for their mediation theory by calculating residual difference scores (errors derived from predicting experienced attainment of job outcomes from initial expectations of outcomes) to operationalize met expectations. The authors state that Irving and Meyer showed that methodological weaknesses associated with difference scores also plague residual difference scores. Prompted by their demonstration, this research applied partial correlations (partialing out experienced outcomes from residual differences) and J. R. Edwards' (1994) polynomial regression approach to verify whether met expectations underlie realistic previews' effectiveness. These reanalyses disputed met expectations. As a result, this inquiry revised the formulation advocated by Hom et al, positing that coping strategies and perceptions of employer concern account for how posthire previews work.

A reanalysis of P. G. Irving and J. P. Meyer's (1994) data demonstrates empirically that results using residual difference scores can be misleading. On a conceptual level residual difference scores are very similar to simple difference scores (i.e., they are essentially weighted difference scores) and produce results that are very similar. In order for residual difference score measures of met expectations to be significant, polynomial regression analysis of the met expectations hypothesis is necessary. The use of residual scores for the purposes of operationalizing met expectations creates the same problems as does the use of difference scores.

In this article, the author demonstrates how a slightly more complex power function fitted the numerosity data nearly as well as the CMPL function, and how race models, such as instance theory and the EBRW, can predict deviations from a pure power law of practice and can predict nonmonotonic changes in standard deviations with practice. Potential limitations of CMPL are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on the article by W. B. Cutler et al (see record [rid]1998-00097-001[/rid]) regarding an unidentified pheromone placed in an aftershave lotion that increased human sociosexual behavior during a 6-wk treatment period. The authors believe that reanalysis of the data raises doubt about their conclusions. The authors consider the original claims by Cutler et al regarding the Ss' perceptions of positive results, increased sleeping next to a partner and petting, and increased sexual intercourse as potentially affected by the treatment, arguing that their results do not reach statistical significance. They also note that nowhere in the Cutler et al article are data or references provided that would demonstrate that the active ingredients that affected heterosexual men were isolated to provide the foundation for their choice of the unnamed, proprietary, active ingredient.

Abstract = {20 young (mean age 20.5 yrs) and 20 middle-aged (MA) academics (mean age 57.2 yrs) performed a priming-recall task which was presented in 3 blocks. In each block, Ss read 40 word pairs after which a recall task had to be carried out. Half of the word pairs were highly associated while the others were low associated. Targets showed the N400 of the MA group to be both delayed and smaller in amplitude for low-associated items. N400 of primes, however, showed no age-related latency difference but was smaller for the MA group due to a positive shift. It is argued that this shift possibly indicates age differences in semantic activation or buildup of context. A reanalysis showed individual differences in word pair processing to depend on recall performance. In general, high recallers were found to show a much larger differentiation between low- and high-associated targets. This resulted from a much larger N400 component elicited by low-associated targets and a more positive event related potential (ERP) in the N400-region for the high-associated targets. It is suggested that the MA Ss activated the expected target word to a level at least equivalent to the younger Ss, but that the activated network itself was larger/less selective particularly in Ss showing a low recall.

Abstract = {Discusses methods for modeling the concept of synergy at the level of manifest categorical variables. First, a classification of concepts of synergy is presented, additive and nonadditive concepts of synergy are distinguished, and examples are given from the natural sciences and the social sciences. Log-linear models are proposed for modelling the concept of the relationship between the agents involved in a synergetic process. These relationships are expressed in form of contrasts, expressed in effect coding vectors in design matrices for nonstandard log-linear models. A method by C. Schuster is used to transform design matrices such that parameters reflect the proposed relationships. An example reanalyses data presented by Y. M. M. Bishop, S. E. Fienberg, and P. W. Holland (1975) that describe the development of thromboembolisms in women who differ in their patterns of contraceptive use and smoking. Alternative methods of analysis are compared and implications for developmental research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper revisits a landmark study of the prevalence of mental illness in the state of Massachusetts conducted by Edward Jarvis in the 19th century. Jarvis drew an improper conclusion about the relationship between social class, ethnicity, and insanity, asserting that the Irish foreign-born had a higher prevalence of insanity in each social stratum. A reanalysis of Jarvis' data shows that in both the pauper and independent social classes in Massachusetts, the prevalence of insanity was significantly lower among foreign-born persons than among native-born persons. On the basis of his misperception, Jarvis constructed elaborate etiological theories. These theories made a strong impact on the mental health service policies of his day. The effects of incomplete examination of data on etiological theories and mental health policy in current times are highlighted in this article.

Abstract = {Comments on the article by P. V. Kargopoulos and A. Demetriou (see record [rid]1998-12476-001[/rid]) on selective structural systems (SSSs) of processing within different reality and knowledge domains. Smith notes that the original authors identify 5 properties of their account of the mind, which is stated to be (1) complete, both (2) logically and (3) psychologically sound, such that its elements are (4) independent but (5) share self-identical processes. This is an ambitious specification. Smith challenges (1) in relation to the original authors' account of modal knowledge. There are 2 arguments. The first is that modal logic is both intensional, not extensional, and also acceptable. This undermines the original authors' commitment to extentionality with regard to (2). The other argument is that modal knowledge in a multi-structural model of the mind requires a unistructural component in a general system, contrary to claims made about property (3) Smith concludes that property (5) is acknowledged in Piaget's unistructural account. The implication is that property (4) merits reanalysis with Piaget's main problem in mind, namely the development of modal knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three eye-tracking experiments investigated plausibility effects on recovery from misanalysis in sentence comprehension. On the initially favored analysis, a noun phrase served as the object of the preceding verb. On the ultimately correct analysis, it served as the subject of a main clause in Experiments 1 and 3 and of a complement clause in Experiment 2. If the object analysis was implausible, disruption occurred during processing of the noun phrase. If it was plausible, disruption occurred after disambiguation. In Experiment 3, discourse context affected plausibility of the initial analysis and subsequent reanalysis. The authors argue that readers performed substantial semantic processing on the initial analysis and committed strongly when it was plausible. Experiment 3 showed that these effects were not due to selectional restrictions or word co-occurrences and that the interpretation of the target sentence was not computed in isolation.

Abstract = {Previous studies using the process dissociation and the remember–know procedures led to conflicting conclusions regarding the effects of anterograde amnesia on recollection and familiarity. We argue that these apparent contradictions arose because different models were used to interpret the results and because differences in false-alarm rates between groups biased the estimates provided by those models. A reanalysis of those studies with a dual-process signal-detection model that incorporates response bias revealed that amnesia led to a pronounced reduction in recollection and smaller but consistent reduction in familiarity. To test the assumptions of the model and to further assess recognition deficits in amnesics, we examined receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) in amnesics and controls. The ROCs of the controls were curved and asymmetrical, whereas those of the amnesics were curved and symmetrical. The results supported the predictions of the model and indicated that amnesia was associated with deficits in both recollection and familiarity.

Abstract = {Presents Bayesian analysis of hierarchically structured data with random intercept and heterogeneous within-group (Level-1 [L1]) variance. Inferences about all parameters, including the L1 variance and intercept for each group, are based on their marginal posterior distributions approximated via the Gibbs sampler. Analysis of artificial data with varying degrees of heterogeneity and varying Level-2 (L2) sample sizes illustrates the utility of a Bayesian approach to model heterogeneity of variance (Bayes/Het). Results are compared to those based on restricted maximum likelihood with homogeneous L1 variance (RML/Hom). Bayes/Het provides interval estimates for L1 variances and their heterogeneity, and for each group's intercept. RML/Hom inferences about L2 regression coefficients appear robust to heterogeneity, and conditions under which such robustness can be expected are discussed. Application is illustrated in a reanalysis of High School and Beyond data. It appears informative and practically feasible to obtain approximate marginal posterior distributions for all L1 and L2 parameters when analyzing large- or small-scale survey data. A key advantage of the Bayes approach is that inferences about any parameter appropriately reflect uncertainty about all remaining parameters.

Abstract = {Presents a reanalysis of the structure of Freud's specimen dream "Irma." Detailed observation of manifest dream sequences indicated self-advocating occurrences facilitating the dreamer's self interests, opposed by self-adversarial interferences. Further examination of manifest dream syntactical structure additionally suggested a recurrent, 4-step, algorithm for personal problem-solving within an interpersonal matrix consisting of the following cycle: (1) an opening scene setting the stage (2) for the emergence of a self-concern (3) which evokes a strategy to deal with the dreamer's self-concern (4) that eventuates in a consequence of the strategy. These steps repeat until the dream ends. Observing these manifest dream structural features, attributable to broadening past theorizing with "bottom-up" approaches, clarifies the dream's problem-solving process by providing an empirical, observable framework for dream interpretation and by contributing to their consensual validation.

Abstract = {Sought to replicate the classic cross-cultural study by J. Roberts et al (1959) in which the authors delineated a 3-category classification for games (i.e., physical skill, strategy, and chance) as well as a definition of games. Both the classification system and the definition have become anthropological standards. Roberts et al also found that several cultural variables, including measures of cultural complexity; beliefs in the frequency of aggression or benevolence of gods or spirits; and environmental conditions, correlated with the presence–absence of different game types. However, the sample that Roberts et al used was relatively small (only 50 societies) and nonstandard. The purpose of this study was to replicate the study using samples other than the 50 used by Roberts et al. Game codes for the societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS; G. P. Murdock and D. R. White, 1969) were used in the replication. The reanalysis of the foregoing hypotheses by Roberts et al suggests that their results are valid.

Abstract = {The Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) provides 6 subscales for a multidimensional assessment of perfectionism: Concern over Mistakes (CM), Personal Standards (PS), Parental Expectations (PE), Parental Criticism (PC), Doubts about actions (DA), and Organization (OR). Despite its increasing popularity in personality and clinical research, the FMPS has also drawn some criticism for its factorial instability across samples. The present article argues that this instability may be due to an overextraction of components. Whereas all previous analyses presented 6-factor solutions for the FMPS items, a reanalysis with Horn's parallel analysis suggested only 4 or 5 underlying factors. To investigate the nature of these factors, item responses from 243 Ss were subjected to principal component analysis. Again, parallel analysis retained only 4 components. Varimax rotation replicated PS and OR as separate factors, whereas combining CM with DA as well as PE with PC. Consequently, the present article suggests a reduction to 4 (instead of 6) FMPS subscales. Differential correlations with anxiety, depression, parental representations and action tendencies underscore the advantage of this solution.

Cued recall was used to elicit voluntary episodic memories from 12 20–27 yr old students using verbal cues that were comparable to the cues that elicited the involuntary memories. The findings demonstrate that voluntary and involuntary retrieval may access different samples of autobiographical memories. The voluntary memories were less specific, more frequently rehearsed, and less emotionally positive than the involuntary memories. A reanalysis of the diary study examined conditions of involuntary retrieval. It occurred most frequently when attention was diffuse and was typically triggered by environmental cues matching central features of the remembered event.

The authors report 2 experiments in which effects of age of acquisition on lexical retrieval are demonstrated using real age-of-acquisition norms. In Experiment 1, real age of acquisition emerged as a powerful predictor of adult object-naming speed. There were also significant effects of visual complexity, word frequency, and name agreement. Similar results were obtained in reanalyses of data from 2 other studies of object naming. In Experiment 2, real age of acquisition affected immediate but not delayed object-naming speed. The authors conclude that age-of-acquisition effects are real and suggest that age of acquisition influences the speed with which spoken word forms can be retrieved from the phonological lexicon.

Abstract = {Two eye-tracking experiments examined processing of sentences like The shrubs were planted by the apprentice/greenhouse that morning, where the by phrase is locally ambiguous between an agent and a location. Experiment 1 found a preference to initially interpret the by phrase agentively in the absence of context. In Experiment 2, a context like The head gardener decided [who should]/[where to] plant the shrubs induced an expectation that either an agent or a location would subsequently be specified. After agentive contexts, locatives were harder to process than agentives. After locative contexts, both sentences were easy to process. The authors argue that the verb and interrogative words (who, where) activate thematic roles, which can be associated with corresponding phrases. Phrases that express activated roles are easy to process. Phrases that might express activated roles but are subsequently shown not to express those roles require reanalysis.

Abstract = {Many reports of successful school-based intervention programs can be criticized for their choice of a unit of analysis and for the neglect of measurement errors. This article is an illustration of how different conclusions can be reached from different choices of units of analyses and/or of different treatment of the data. This is done by a reanalysis of a well-reported data set. The data is thoroughly taken apart, using different statistical techniques. The result of the analyses shows that earlier reported effects of a normative school-based drug prevention program were not found. The subsequent search for moderator effects of the same program, such as a lowering effect on the relationship between the pre- and posttest or on the relationship between respondents' use and the use of their friends, was not successful either. It is concluded that the null hypothesis of zero effects should be retained. More successful was a search for individual characteristics that show significant relationships with respondents' alcohol use. Among them was the abuse of alcohol by adults in respondents' direct social environment and the use of friends. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The Flynn Effect proposed by J. R. Flynn (see records [rid]1984-11828-001[/rid] and [rid]1987-17534-001[/rid]) is reviewed and evaluated. Even in the presence of a skeptical and critical scrutiny of the effect, it appears that there is more than just methodological artifact to be explained. But the acceptance of the effect has been too quick. The proper explanations for the effect will not be meaningful until the nature of the effect is much better understood than it is now. Six questions are raised that have not been adequately answered. Two criticisms of the logic underlying the Flynn Effect are presented—one showing that even if IQ and SAT are highly correlated, their secular means will not necessarily track one another; the second showing that results by Flynn are as consistent with a changing IQ variance as with a changing mean. The second of these is empirically evaluated with a reanalysis of a subset of the sources of Flynn 1984 data. Finally, 10 research strategies and designs are suggested that would help us better understand the effect. The critique is developed with the goal of clarifying the nature, meaning and causes of the Flynn Effect. The author hopes that the critique will stimulate both healthy skepticism about the Flynn Effect and careful research into its actual causes.

Abstract = {The role of semantic transparency in morphological and in compound processing is examined. It is argued that the notion of semantic transparency is crucial to an account of how compounds are represented and processed in the mind. A sketch of a model is proposed in which compound processing is described in terms of stimulus, lexical, and conceptual, properties. The model represents the notion of semantic transparency in terms of a four-way classification of the semantic relationship between a compound's constituents and the corresponding independent morphemes. It also distinguishes between semantically componential and noncomponential compounds. It is proposed that the model offers a framework within which experimental psycholinguistic findings can be understood and within which aphasic deficits associated with compound processing can be characterized. The paper presents a reanalysis of an aphasic patient who exhibits the tendency to interpret semantically opaque compounds as though they were transparent and to interpret opaque compounds in terms of a blend of constituent and whole-word meaning. It is argued that the underlying deficit in this patient is the failure for inhibition to result from the competition among stimuli at the conceptual level of representation.

Abstract = {Reports on the development, validation, and application of the Adaptation to Age-Related Vision Loss (AVL) Scale, a measure of psychosocial adaptation to visual impairment specifically designed for older persons. This adaptation encompassed acceptance of vision loss, attitudes toward rehabilitative training, and attitudes toward relationships with others. After a preliminary 33-item AVL Scale was developed, it was administered to 2 samples totaling 498 65–100 yr olds. 48% of Ss in the 1st study, and 39.2% in the 2nd were legally blind. Results of item analyses of the 33-item scale, factor structure and internal consistency analyses of the final 24-item AVL Scale, reanalysis of data from both studies, and validity analysis, support the reliability and validity of the AVL Scale. Uses of the AVL Scale are described, including survey research, clinical assessments, and evaluation of vision rehabilitation interventions. Limitations include use of a dichotomous scoring system which may have contributed to failure to identify independent factors, and ceiling effects that may limit utility in assessing change over time. Preliminary results from its application have provided empirical support for the benefit of vision rehabilitation services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article revisits and reexamines previously reported findings addressing the longitudinal course of violent couples (N. S. Jacobson et al, 1996). The authors engaged in unprecedented efforts to obtain follow-up data from couples that were formerly missing during the 2-yr follow-up. Efforts were remarkably successful, with 11 of the 15 couples supplying marital status information. By recontacting this previously missing subset of data, the authors were able to reanalyze previously reported findings, specifically to examine the validity of 3 pieces of clinical lore: (1) victims of domestic abuse are unlikely to leave their abusive husbands, (2) victims of domestic violence are passive and self-defeating, and (3) physical violence is the most important factor in women's decisions to leave. Reanalyses revealed faults in all 3 of the preceding pieces of lore. The clinical implications of all 3 findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

They interpreted their confirmatory factor analysis as supporting the need to distinguish between these 4 self-perceptions as well as the 3 domains and to extend current academic self-concept theories (e.g., H. W. Marsh, 1990, 1993a) that emphasize the domains. Interpretations based on the authors' reanalysis of Simpson et al.'s data contradicted their major conclusions that apparently reflected idiosyncrasies in their items and their methodology, but supported predictions based on previous theory and research. More generally, the authors demonstrate a construct validity approach that blends theory, data, statistical models, and substantive interpretation to validate and compare competing interpretations.

Abstract = {Asserts, through empirical, numerical, geometric, and algebraic demonstrations, that the positive correlations predicted by C.S. Spearman's (1927) hypothesis (significant mean White-Black IQ differences reflect differences in g, general factor common to all complex tests of mental ability) are psychometric artefacts. It is argued these are artefacts which also arise (1) with measures that have nothing to do with general ability, and (2) with any set of moderately correlated random data, once the sample is split into high and low groups. This interpretation predicts that if sample sizes differ substantially, the correlation will be larger for the 1st principal component of the larger group. This prediction is demonstrated in simulated and real data sets, including toy data from (1969) study of Head Start impact on Black and White children, and A. R. Jensen's (1985) reanalysis of intelligence test data. The author states that positive Spearman hypothesis correlations can be discounted as artefacts under 2 distinct interpretations, and concludes they are a tautological consequence of the facts that IQ test subtests correlate positively, and that Blacks score lower than Whites on these tests. It is concluded they reveal nothing about the nature of g and Black-White differences, and do not warrant any of the extrapolations derived from them, including Jensen's.

However, they did not report partial correlations of affect intensity and NMR expectancies, independent of each other, with coping and depression. Such information is needed for development of models of the coping process which integrate the roles of temperament variables, such as affect intensity, and cognitive-social learning person variables, such as NMR expectancies. Reanalysis of Flett et al's correlation matrix revealed that affect intensity and NMR expectancies were each independently associated with distinct coping dispositions, but that only NMR expectancies were independently associated with depressive symptoms.

Abstract = {Examined the role of counsel as a source of arbitrary and capricious sentencing in cases of capital murder. The method is a reanalysis of the data of D. C. Baldus et al (1990) on 606 cases of capital murder in Georgia in the 1970s. Three variables relating to the character of the defendant and the circumstances surrounding the crime were studied: aggravation, mitigation, and legitimacy. Controlling for variables describing character and circumstances, a death sentence was more likely when defense counsel was appointed rather than retained privately. This was a consequence primarily of the prosecutor's decision to seek a death sentence rather than jury bias in sentencing. Defendants were more often given death sentences when the victim was White, of a high social status, and when the defendant and victim were strangers. Mitigation was related to sentence and prosecutor's decision to seek a jury trial, but not to jury verdict at penalty trial. These data support the conclusion that sentencing under the Georgia statute was in the 1970s, and is today to some degree, arbitrary and capricious.

Abstract = {Recent studies of the mathematical relationship between time and forgetting suggest that it is a power function rather than an exponential function, a finding that has important theoretical consequences. Through computational analysis and reanalyses of published data, we demonstrate that arithmetic averaging of exponential curves can produce an artifactual power curve, particularly when there are large and systematic differences among the slopes of the component curves. A series of simulations showed that the amount of power artifact is small when the slopes of the component curves are normally or rectangularly distributed and when the performance measure is noise free. However, the simulations also showed that the artifact can be quite large, depending on the shape of the noise distribution and restrictions in the performance range. We conclude that claims concerning the form of memory functions should consider whether the data are likely to contain artifact caused by averaging or by the presence of range-restricted noise.

Abstract = {To properly test the hypothesis that empathy-associated helping is altruistic, one needs to (a) consider plausible nonaltruistic alternatives for the observed empathy–helping effects, (b) validly and reliably measure these nonaltruistic alternatives, and (c) examine whether the empathy–helping relationship remains after removing the effects of the full complement of reasonable nonaltruistic alternatives. C. D. Batson, K. Sager, E. Garst, M. Kang, K. Rubchinsky, and K. Dawson (1997) failed to meet these criteria. New data, and reanalyses of existing data, bolster the case that self-other overlap—a nonaltruistic motivator—underlies the association between empathy and costly helping. At best, empathy per se leads to superficial helping. In a postscript, the authors comment briefly on C. D. Batson's (1997) reply to this comment and, given his remarks, speculate as to whether the empathy–altruism formulation is even relevant to understanding meaningful forms of help.

Abstract = {Discusses the impact that underweighting the alternative has on overconfidence in a particular hypothesis and other related measures. Consideration of evidence for and against the focal hypothesis while underweighting or ignoring evidence for and against the alternative was emphasized. Computer simulations showed that underweighting the alternative is sufficient for producing overconfidence under quite general conditions. In addition, data from 2 previous empirical studies (C. R. M. McKenzie, 1997, and in press) were reanalyzed. In these simulated medical diagnosis studies, one group of subjects was known to take into account the alternative, and one to underweight it. The pattern of differences between the 2 groups was similar to the pattern found in the computer simulations where weighting of the alternative was manipulated. Furthermore, encouragement to take into account the alternative had no effect on the former group's behavior, but affected the latter group in a manner predicted by the simulations. Both the simulations and reanalyses provide direct evidence of the effect of underweighting the strength of alternatives on overconfidence.

Abstract = {Compares the linear and binary assumptions of information theory to assumptions of nonlinear approaches to understanding human information transfer. A model of information in open systems that rely on qualitative and aesthetic assessments is proposed that includes elements of entropy dissipation. The theoretical and methodological tools for this modeling come from chaos theory, fuzzy logic, stochastic resonance, and coordinated management of meaning.

Abstract = {The Fatigue Symptom Checklist (FSC; H. Yoshitake, see record [rid]1979-22439-001[/rid]), developed in Japan, was selected to measure postpartum fatigue among American women. Minor wording changes and a change in the reference time frame were made. Reliability and validity of this modification of the FSC were tested in this reanalysis of data from a longitudinal study of 285 mothers. Internal consistency reliability for the total 30-item FSC was acceptable. Evidence for criterion-related and construct validity was found. Original FSC subscales were not confirmed in these analyses. Using factor analysis, a shortened 10-item postpartum scale and 2 postpartum subscales, physical and mental fatigue, were identified. LISREL confirmatory factor analysis supported the subscales. Results support appropriateness of the total 30-item FSC, the shortened 10-item postpartum scale, and postpartum subscales for measuring postpartum fatigue in American women.

Abstract = {In "Play, dreams and imitation in childhood" (PDI), Jean Piaget provided an extensive corpus of situations in which children and adults interact, both verbally and nonverbally. These examples are the foundation upon which he built his theory of the early levels of development, upholding the thesis of a cognitive continuum between accommodation, imitation and symbolic representation, and firmly criticizing the hypothesis of the decisive role of the "social life" in this evolution. The author proposes a reinterpretation of the corpus contained in PDI, which brings to light that Piaget does not sufficiently take into account the adult's interventions at work during these interactions. The reanalysis confirms the primacy of accommodation over imitation, and agrees with Piaget that "social life" does not intervene, as such, in the development. However, it is only adult activity that proposes the social significations whose internalization will give rise to the symbolic representation, and that transforms the elementary psychical functioning into the specific functioning of human thought.

Abstract = {The results of many human operant conditioning experiments appear to show that humans are less sensitive than are nonhumans to operant consequences, which suggests species discontinuities in basic behavioral processes. A reanalysis of 311 data sets from 25 studies that employed variable-interval schedules of reinforcement designed to assess sensitivity to reinforcement corroborates the claim that human behavioral allocation among alternatives often deviates from predictions based on rates of experimentally programed consequences. Close inspection of the studies in question, however, suggests that methodological issues contribute heavily to the differences noted so far between humans and nonhumans and that an explanation based upon species discontinuities is not tenable.

In the book, they located their analysis in a traditionally feminist position of marginality, where they saw themselves allied with women of color in resisting a patriarchal academy. Subsequent discussions with colleagues and the proliferation of literature on Whiteness led them to realize that their own Whiteness, and the effects of Whiteness itself remained uninterrogated in their original work. In this reanalysis of data from their book, they examine how assumptions of Whiteness shape the construction of knowledge as it is produced and resisted in the classroom.

Abstract = {Presents a reanalysis of 9 positron emission tomography studies involving visual processing to determine the generality of these modulations across a wide variety of visual tasks. Blood flow increases in early visual areas were replicated in 6 of 9 studies, and the test statistic aggregating over studies was highly significant, showing that active tasks can induce modulations in the early stages of the cortical visual pathway. Modulations showed several task dependencies, suggesting that, in some cases, the underlying mechanism was selective rather than nonselective. Replicable blood flow decreases were seen: (1) at or near the auditory Brodmann area left 41/42 in 2 of 5 studies, but in different locations, (2) in the parietal operculum and Brodmann area 40 and, (3) not in the primary somatosensory association area. These results were inconsistent with a model in which the precortical input to task-irrelevant sensory cortical areas was broadly suppressed.

Abstract = {Results from previous investigations indicate that the implication-realization (I-R) model (E. Narmour, 1990) of expectancy in melody may be overspecified and more complex than necessary. Indeed, E. G. Schellenberg's (1996) revised model, with two fewer predictor variables, improved predictive accuracy compared with the original model. A reanalysis of data reported by L. L. Cuddy and C. A. Lunney (1995) provided similar results. When the principles of the I-R model were submitted to a principal-components analysis, a solution containing 3 orthogonal (uncorrelated) factors retained the accuracy of the model but was inferior to the revised model. A separate principal-components analysis of the predictors of the revised model yielded a two-factor solution that did not compromise the revised model's predictive power. Consequently, an even simpler model of melodic expectancy was derived. These results provide further evidence that redundancy in the I-R model can be eliminated without loss of predictive accuracy.

Abstract = {Configural frequency analysis (CFA) tests whether certain individual patterns in different variables are observed more frequently in a sample than expected by chance. In normative CFA, these patterns are derived from the S's specific position in relation to sample characteristics such as the median or the mean. In ipsative CFA, patterns are defined within an individual reference system, e.g., relative to the S's median of different variable scores. Normative CFA examines dimensionality of scales and is comparable to factor analysis in this respect. Ipsative CFA rather yields information about location of scores in different variables, in a similar way to ANOVA or Friedman testing. However, both normative and ipsative CFA may supply information not obtainable by means of the aforementioned methods. This is illustrated in a reanalysis of data in 4 scales of an anxiety inventory.

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the discussion on the construct validity of assessment centers by discussing the appropriate application of confirmatory factor analysis on multitrait-multimethod matrices and examining the principles underlying the construction of assessment centers. Based on a paper by H. W. Marsh (1989) it is argued that, when applying confirmatory factor analysis, the use of correlated uniquenesses to model method effects can avoid poorly defined solutions and increase the variance in behavior explained by dimensions. The advantages of this statistical approach are demonstrated in a reanalysis of data of P. Bycio et al (1987) as well as an analysis of our own assessment center data. Our study analyzed data from 70 participants at one-day assessment centers. Three dimensions were recorded in three exercises in line with the construction principle of a small number of highly observable dimensions recommended by B. B. Gaugler and G. C. Thornton (1989) and M. Kleinmann et al (1995). The analysis revealed substantial contributions of the dimensions to the variance in behavior ratings.

Abstract = {Examines the question of how exactly the physical processes in the brain cause consciousness. What is distinctive about the way in which modern scientists and scholars are approaching this question is that they are treating it as a scientific problem rather than a metaphysical one. This transition reflects the air of expectation in contemporary cognitive science to the effect that an empirical solution is imminent to a philosophical problem that previously was considered insoluble. Nevertheless, a recent authoritative review of the publications of such leading contemporary workers in the field as F. Crick, D. Dennett, G. Edelman, R. Penrose, and I. Rosenfield has concluded that they have all failed to provide a satisfactory answer to the question (J. Searle 1995a). The present paper makes a psychoanalytic contribution to this interdisciplinary effort and provides an alternative answer to the question, based on Freud's conceptualization of the problem of consciousness. The paper takes a concrete example from Searle's review, reanalyses it within Freud's metapsychological frame of reference, and shows how this frame provides a radical solution to the problem. This implication of Freud's work has not yet been recognized and so has not received the attention it deserves. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Uses a developmental function approach to describe age-related change and individual differences in infant information processing during the 1st yr of life. The Visual Expectation Paradigm is used to measure speed of information processing, response variability, and expectancy formation. Eye-movement reaction time and anticipatory saccades were gathered for 13 infants assessed monthly from 2–9 mo and then again at 12 mo. Analysis of response patterns demonstrated the applicability of the paradigm throughout the age range studied. Converging operations strongly indicate that the traditional estimate of the minimum time required for infants to initiate a saccade to a peripheral stimulus may be as much as 100 msec too long. Moreover, the newly estimated minimum of 133 msec does not appear to change during 2–12 mo period. Reanalysis of the present data and past research reveals that the new, shorter minimum reaction time (RT) is unlikely to affect findings based on mean RT. However, using the traditional minimum RT will inflate estimates of percentage anticipation, especially in infants older than 5 mo. In conclusion, the Variable Criterion Model (G. R. Grice, 1968) is used to integrate 3 key findings: regular age changes in mean RT and variability but no age changes in the minimum RT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Moreover, suspects who were arrested and perceived that they were treated in a procedurally fair manner had subsequent assault rates that were as low as those suspects given a more favorable outcome (warned and then released without arrest).

Abstract = {This study examines the divergent validity of the neo-Piagetian measures of processing capacity by reanalyzing two factor-analytic studies of processing capacity (R. Case and T.

Abstract = {Explores alternatives to "increasing placebo response rate" as explanations for difficulty demonstrating therapeutic effects of new compounds for anxiety and depression. A study of 81 patients, treated with placebo, alprazolam 2 mg or 6 mg, or imipramine 225 mg daily, was reanalyzed to investigate the effect of baseline pathology and selective effects of treatment on biological and cognitive components of panic disorder. The regression of endpoint on baseline number of spontaneous panic attacks differed among treatment groups, with lower slopes for the more active compounds. Only patients with many panic attacks at baseline benefitted from the active compounds. Also, treatment effects declined progressively on the more cognitive aspects of the disorder (situational panic attacks and phobia ratings) for alprazolam and were entirely absent for imipramine. This reanalysis suggests that several issues may increase the sensitivity of therapeutic studies of promising compounds in panic disorder: recruiting and retaining more patients with baseline pathology severe enough to benefit from pharmacological treatment; exploring potentially more appropriate models for data analysis; and identifying and focusing on biological and behavioral aspects of the disorder.

Abstract = {Reports errors in "Double cross-validation and improved sensitivity of the rapid screen of mild traumatic brain injury" by Veronica Eileen De Monte, Gina Malke Geffen, Chrisopher Randall May and Ken McFarland (Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 2004[Aug], Vol 26[5], 628-644). The authors recently discovered that there were errors in the data that were reported in the original article. Specifically, 37 cases were accidentally duplicated across the two samples used in the cross-validation analyses conducted in this study. The duplication occurred as a result of merging two databases with overlapping data to form the samples used in the study in question. While reanalysis of corrected data did not change the pattern of results, the authors wish to withdraw the paper from the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. The authors have undertaken an independent audit of their entire database to ensure that the same or similar errors (or any other errors) do not exist in the data relevant to other studies conducted by their research group and published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology and in other journals. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2004-17384-005[/rid].) This study aimed to replicate and cross-validate the Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) for diagnosing mild TBI (mTBI). One hundred (81 male, 19 female) cases of mTBI and 35 (23 male and 12 female) cases of orthopedic injuries were tested within 24 hr of injury. Double cross-validation was used to examine whether total RSC scores obtained in the current sample, generalized to one previously reported. In the new sample, mTBI patients answered fewer orientation questions, recalled fewer words on the learning trial and after a delay, judged fewer sentences in 2 min, and completed fewer symbols in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test than orthopedic controls. The formulae and cut-offs developed on the original and new samples produced similar sensitivity and overall correct classification rates. Inclusion of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test performance of the new sample improved the sensitivity (80.2%) and specificity (82.6%) in males. It did not improve the correct classification rate in females, which was 89.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity before the inclusion of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Taken together, these results indicate that a combined score on this 12-min screen yields a measure of level of brain impairment up to 24 hr after mTBI.

The pressure from many lobby and professional groups to recognize the gay movement and give it credence has derived much of its impetus from the use of misleading data, and notably the almost mythical 10% homosexual rate reported by Kinsey et al. Clinicians now find themselves constrained when seeking to provide therapeutic assistance to those who come seeking it.

Since local ties only make up a minority of people's active ties, network analysts have argued for decades that the neighborhood is not very important. Reanalysis of the author and his colleague's (e.g., B. Wellman, 1982; B. Wellman and S.

Moreover, it is shown that when active contacts with coworkers, who like neighbors are physically proximate, are taken into account, two-thirds of all contacts are local. Just as Humpty-Dumpty (L. Carroll, 1872) asserted that when he uses a word, it means just what he chooses it to mean, a network can be anything we want it to be. It depends on how it is defined.

Abstract = {We explored 3 factors—similarity, dissimilarity, and markedness—as they relate to second language (L2) phonological acquisition. Previous studies have made claims about difficulty, order of acquisition, and ultimate achievement depending on L2 exposure but have often presented conflicting claims and results. This study incorporates similarity and dissimilarity into a hypothesis about rate of acquisition: The rate of acquisition for a dissimilar phenomenon is faster than for a similar phenomenon. Although not stated in the hypothesis, effects of markedness are accounted for: Degree of markedness, an intervening factor, can increase or decrease rate. The claims are strongly supported by analyses of two experiments investigating the acquisition of /j/ and /z/ of 10 adult Korean learners of English, as well as by reanalyses of data from previous studies. Although the evidence presented here deals exclusively with phonology, it should be possible to test the hypothesis for other linguistic phenomena.

The authors also describe evidence of artifacts in the original reported data due to response set and stereotypes, and discuss discrepancies between original and reported data.

Abstract = {A multivariate mixed-effects approach for meta-analysis is presented. The approach (a) incorporates as outcomes multiple effect sizes per study; (b) allows different studies to have different subsets of effect sizes; and (c) treats each study's effect sizes as random realizations from a population of possible effect sizes. Application is illustrated via reanalysis of data from studies assessing the effects of coaching on verbal and mathematical subtests of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Covariance components are estimated via restricted maximum likelihood (REML); inferences about regression coefficients and specific study effect sizes are based on their joint conditional distribution given the REML covariance component estimates. The approach can be implemented via now-standard software for unbalanced hierarchical data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from participants listening to or reading sentences that were correct, contained a violation of the required syntactic category, or contained a syntactic-category ambiguity. When sentences were presented auditorily (Experiment 1), there was an early left anterior negativity for syntactic-category violations, but not for syntactic-category ambiguities. Both anomaly types elicited a late centroparietally distributed positivity. When sentences were presented visually word by word (Experiment 2), again an early left anterior negativity was found only for syntactic-category violations, and both types of anomalies elicited a late positivity. The combined data are taken to be consistent with a 2-stage model of parsing, including a 1st stage, during which an initial phrase structure is built and a 2nd stage, during which thematic role assignment and, if necessary, reanalysis takes place. Disruptions to the 1st stage of syntactic parsing appear to be correlated with an early left anterior negativity, whereas disruptions to the 2nd stage might be correlated with a late posterior distributed positivity.

Abstract = {The big-five personality factors were investigated using the trait pleasure–arousability–dominance (PAD) temperament model to assess overlap, and, specifically, similarities and differences, among the five dimensions. 28 men and 44 women rated the markers for the big-five factors and completed the 22-item Trait Pleasure–Displeasure Scale (A. Mehrabian, 1978), the Trait Arousability Scale (A. Mehrabian, 1995), and the Trait Dominance–Submissiveness Scale. Obtained results plus reanalysis of comparable data from a sample of 39 men and 99 women showed that extraverts were primarily dominant and secondarily pleasant. Agreeableness resembled dependency with pleasant, arousable, and submissive characteristics, but involved greater pleasantness. Conscientiousness included equal degrees of pleasant and dominant qualities. Emotional stability involved almost equal degrees of pleasant and unarousable characteristics, lacking the important dominant feature in this trait. Sophistication was weighted primarily by dominant, and secondarily by arousable, characteristics. The PAD scales explained approximately 75% of the reliable variance in 3 of the factors (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness) that have been identified. PAD components of the big-five factors helped explain the substantial overlap among the factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Argues that social archaeologists' ability to make warranted statements about past societies from material remains is conditioned by the social-behavioral models that inform their interpretations. Current rational-actor models underconceptualize the complexity of social conduct by overrationalizing it. An outline is offered of a more realistic composite model that conceives of social behavior as following a mode of limited rationality much of the time but also engendering irrationality. The model is used to inform a reanalysis of archaeological patterns in Bronze Age Sardinia. The approach holds important insights for social archaeology in general that include the potentially significant role of normative-cultural traditions in the reproduction of nonrational institutions, the importance of historical trajectories in preconditioning social adaptations, and the importance of structural contradictions in creating opportunities for political ascent in noncentralized societies.

Social cognitive formulations suggest a mediating relationship whereby effects of the RTE on productivity operate through the intervening mechanism of students' SE beliefs. Results of a reanalysis of earlier data (J. C. Phillips and R. K. Russell, see record [rid]1995-11235-001[/rid]) from 125 counseling psychology students support a social cognitive mediational hypothesis.

Abstract = {Reanalyzed and pooled the raw data of 3 case-control studies to review the evidence for risk factors of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The pooled data set comprised 178 patients (aged 26–81 yrs) and 333 controls. The risk of CJD was significantly increased for Ss with a family history (FH) of CJD. There was a significant association between the risk of CJD and an FH of psychotic disease. Although not significantly increased, there was an elevated risk of CJD for Ss with an FH of dementia, a history of poliomyelitis, Ss employed as health professionals, and Ss ever exposed to cows and sheep. No association could be shown with organ meat consumption, including brain. The negative results of this reanalysis reassures the absence of a common risk factor in all CJD patients. However, the ongoing study of CJD in several European countries may provide more evidence to exclude any environmental exposure early in childhood.

When noise is relatively low, as in these simulations, TIT FOR TAT is a very successful overall strategy, while actors using more generous strategies may be exploited by less generous alters. Using lower magnitudes than those used by Kollock, the findings presented here show a complicated picture of mutual invasion by different strategies; no strategy possesses the ability to outperform all others in almost any circumstances. This outcome has a closer fit with real-world situations of social exchange where a variety of strategies can exist. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Several experiments and reanalyses of archival data were performed in which sets of common emotions were mapped onto visual and auditory perceptual stimuli of varying degrees of complexity. Subjects showed reliability across several different experimental paradigms and diverse stimulus sets. Furthermore, the results were reducible to a two-dimensional emotion space of valence and activity, after the work of Osgood, Succi, and Tannenbaum (1957). The perceptual locus of an aesthetic stimulus in this two-dimensional space is hypothesized to provide a first approximation to how the synesthetic qualities of a percept provide a basis for emotional responses to such stimuli. More generally, this direct mapping of percept onto emotion provides an interesting conundrum for theories of emotion research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Discusses the process of generating prosody on-line while reading a sentence orally. Two Japanese studies measured eye-voice span while Ss read aloud. Ss were a total of 22 native speakers of Japanese. In Study 1, the average eye-voice span for simple texts was only about 2.5 characters. In Study 2, the eye-voice span was also about 2.5 characters even when Ss read garden-path sentences that required reanalysis during processing. That the readers looked only a few characters ahead before reading aloud suggests that the prosody they generate is not based on a global syntactic analysis, but instead reflects only limited, local syntactic information. Ss, therefore, make errors and repairs when this locally determined prosody obviously contradicts the meaning of the sentence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In 2 experiments, a new technique called the auditory moving window was used to investigate aspects of spoken-language processing. Participants paced their way through spoken sentences divided into word or wordlike segments, and their processing time for each segment was recorded. The 1st experiment demonstrated that high-frequency words in spoken sentences require less time to process than do low-frequency words. The 2nd experiment demonstrated that words in syntactically demanding contexts (i.e., the disambiguating word of so-called garden-path sentences) are processed longer than the same words in syntactically simpler contexts. Helpful prosodic information appeared to facilitate reanalysis of garden-path structures but did not seem to prevent the misanalysis. The implications of these findings for issues in spoken-language comprehension are discussed. The authors conclude that the auditory moving-window technique provides a useful tool for addressing largely unexplored issues in spoken-language comprehension.

Abstract = {Recent reanalyses suggest that pharmacotherapy was superior to cognitive–behavior therapy in the acute treatment of more severely depressed outpatients in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP). At the same time, this finding was neither robust across sites within the TDCRP nor consistent with findings from other studies. D. F. Klein (1990) has argued that those other studies were inherently flawed because they did not include pill-placebo controls, an argument that he extended to drug–psychotherapy comparisons in the treatment of panic as well. It is agreed that the inclusion of such controls would have facilitated the interpretation of the findings, but it is not agreed that their omission rendered those studies uninterpretable. Cognitive–behavior therapy remains a viable alternative to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depression and a particularly promising intervention in the treatment of panic disorder.

Abstract = {The complex effects of mass and volume on weight perception (e.g., the size-weight illusion) were hypothesized to follow simply from invariants of rotational dynamics. In Experiments 1-3, the rotational inertia of wielded, occluded objects was varied independently of mass, size, and torque. Perceived heaviness depended only on rotational inertia. Reanalysis of J. C. Stevens and L. L. Rubin's (1970) study revealed that size's influence on weight perception depends on specific patterns of the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor. These patterns were simulated in Experiments 4-6 with objects of fixed mass, volume, and visible size. Perceived heaviness decreased and increased, respectively, over object sets with the eigenvalue patterns of (a) constant mass, increasing volume and (b) increasing mass, constant volume.

Abstract = {Describes the syntactic processing of structural ambiguities in German verb-2nd clauses. J. Grimshaw's (1991 and 1993) proposal focuses on the role of functional categories in a phrase marker, and the principle of minimal projection. This proposal allows an incremental parse of these ambiguities, consistent with the principles of simplicity and structural determinism as proposed by P. Gorrell (1995). These ambiguities provide evidence against the hypothesis that the parser's initial attachment decisions follow from a maximal-licensing principle, rather than a preference for minimal structure. It is suggested that contrary to the theories of J. D. Fodor and A. Inoue (1994), theories of syntactic processing must not only incorporate mechanisms for resolving conflicts between new input and computed structure, but also distinguish the comparative costs of different reanalysis types.

Abstract = {Comments on the reanalysis by J. L. Ringo (1991) indicating that differences between d' discriminability measures of memory performance by macaque monkeys in normal and lesioned groups did not change systematically with retention-interval duration. There was no evidence of an effect of brain lesion on rate of forgetting (ROF). A quantitative analysis in which power and negative exponential functions were fitted to the d' measures yielded a different conclusion. The rate parameter of the best-fitting functions provided a measure of ROF. Parameter values for ROF were significantly greater for lesioned groups than for normal groups, whereas the parameter describing performance in the absence of a delay did not differ between normal and lesion conditions.

Abstract = {Presents a reanalysis of cross-cultural studies assessing the recognition of facial expression of emotions based on the dimensions of Power Distance (PDI), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI), Individualism, and Masculinity proposed by G. Hofstede (1984). The study examined the differences between Caucasian and non-Caucasian samples, and whether meaningful relations between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the recognition of facial expression would be present if the effects of the number of emotions and race of the judges were taken into account. Correlations of the accuracy scores with Hofstede's dimensions, in which the number of faces and the race of the judges were controlled, revealed that UAI predicted accuracy scores in the recognition of sadness and fear, suggesting that some reliable cultural differences in the recognition of facially expressed emotions may exist.

Abstract = {Previous editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) have had questionable relevance for school psychologists (SPs). This article traces the development of the DSM-IV, focusing on how changes within and without the nosological system have positioned DSM-IV to be a critically important tool for SPs. It is argued that the DSM-IV has a sounder empirical basis: Within the limits of data and resources, changes were based on extensive literature reviews, reanalyses of existing data sets, and empirical field trials. New theoretical developments allow the criteria to be viewed within a psychological test and provide new directions for validation. These advances are best exemplified in the criteria for attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders. These enhancements, along with trends to address the needs of students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other disorders, make DSM-IV more relevant to psychologists facing an expanded assessment role.

The need for reanalysis is historical-genetical, sociopolitical, and due to international dialogue among Russian scholars and their Western counterparts. Several Vygotskian notions, such as, the zone of proximal development, the social situation of development, activity, element vs unit analysis, the logic of feelings, and reflection/description, are discussed with regard to different prevailing interpretations. A model of teacher professional development is suggested, focusing on correspondence of method to content, modeling, self-determination, self-organization and co-organization of different activities, and analysis and reflection. Awareness, modification, mastery, and creation are different stages in the process of modeling of the teacher's position. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Offers an explanation for the misclassification of cervical smears in false-negative diagnoses, by an experienced cytopathologist engaged in the screening of such smears for cervical cancer, in a women's hospital in England. Spontaneous fluctuation in sensitivity and assimilation to the previous response may be possible explanations of fluctuations in the probability of detection (C. I. Howarth & M. G. Bulmer, 1956). Prior expectations also influences false-negative diagnoses. A reanalysis of the smears revealed 487 new "positives," and showed that diagnostic criteria vary between pathologists. In the absence of internal criteria, the cytopathologist would have to resort to comparing smears with their predecessors, for an absolute judgment. More detailed and accurate classification, and rechecking and re-examination of smears, are suggested for the prevention of systematic misdiagnosis.

Abstract = {Proposes a predictive explanation of the Wason Selection Task (for testing a conditional rule) based on reanalysis of the task, and Relevance Theory. Four experiments on reasoning were conducted on 187 Ss in Italy and France to compare relevance (RC) and irrelevance conditions (IC). Ss were to understand the problem of 2 situations P and Q so that P-and-(not Q) situation will hold true in RC and not in IC. Results show that Ss inferred from the rule directly testable consequences in their order of accessibility, and stopped when the resulting interpretation of the rule met their expectations of relevance. Order of accessibility of the consequences and expectations may vary with the content and context of the rule. Ss selected the cards that may test the directly testable consequences they have inferred from the rule. By devising appropriate rule-context pairs, correct performance can be elicited in any conceptual domain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Phase 1, parser assigns the initial syntactic structure on the basis of word category information. In Phase 2, lexical-semantic and verb-argument structure information is processed and is neurophysiologically manifest in a negative component in the event-related brain potential around 400 msec after stimulus onset that is distributed based on type of information processed. In Phase 3, the parser tries to map the initial syntactic structure onto the available lexical-semantic and verb-argument structure information. In case of an unsuccessful match between the 2 types of information, structural reanalyses may become necessary, which are correlated with a centroparietally distributed late positive component in the event-related brain potential.

Abstract = {Presents a structural analysis of myths in consumption text, using N. Frye's (1957) taxonomy of myths to assign consumer narratives and selected advertisements to 4 categories of mythic plots: comedy, romance, tragedy, and irony. Frye's categorization scheme derives from literature, and the plot types embody structural links between consumption myths and those found in other cultural texts. Each mythos also incorporates values encoded in the plot that reappear in consumption narratives and in advertising appeals using mythic patterns and characterization. Frye's taxonomy is applied to a reanalysis of Thanksgiving narratives and an analysis of pre-Thanksgiving food advertising coupons. The analysis demonstrates that the Thanksgiving narratives and related advertising exemplars fit into conventional plot structures that serve as organizing devices for both the articulation of consumption experience and the design of consumer appeals.

Abstract = {Develops a sequential model of obedience and defiance to authority. A specific hypothesis is advanced: The sooner in the course of the experiment a S begins to show notable resistance, the more likely he/she will be to end up defiant. Audio recordings from 34 Ss who participated in S. Milgram's (1974) Bridgeport condition plus partial data from 2 additional Ss were subjected to a content analysis. Reanalysis of the data supports the hypothesis. The effects of early resistance are discussed in terms of 2 processes: (1) an interpersonal process that works to jam the authority's prods and break the momentum he/she imparts to the interaction; and (2) a psychological process that works to erode the Ss' rationalization for continuing and spurs him/her to search for justification for stopping.

Telephone interviews were conducted with 8 neurologists regarding the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in the population, and 2 Hutterite colonies were visited. Reanalysis with DSM-III-R showed a lower lifetime prevalence rate of both schizophrenia (0.9 per 1000) and bipolar disorder (0.6 per 1000) than reported earlier. Possible explanations for this discrepancy, and for the low prevalence, are given. It is concluded that both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the low prevalence of psychosis in this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

There were few or no differences between male and female patients in history of illness, symptomatology, memory, other cognitive factors, or SSK. SCZ Ss performed worse on the SSK task than did the other 2 groups. Impaired memory was related to poorer SSKs for women, but not men, with SCZ. Reanalysis of data on SSK and memory from an earlier study (K. T. Mueser et al; see record [rid]1992-01627-001[/rid]) revealed a similar pattern of results. Both sets of data suggest that visual memory may be more strongly related to SSK than is verbal memory or attention-concentration.

This argument is based on evidence of an underlying OH effect in a study that purports to unconfound roles of judged group size and ingroup-outgroup judgment by presenting Ss first with a small or large ingroup (or outgroup), then a small comparison outgroup (or ingroup). However, self-categorization theory (SCT) predicts that when an ingroup is judged first it should be perceived as relatively heterogeneous due to the intragroup nature of judgmental context. Consistent with SCT, this reanalysis suggests that manifestations of OH are not independent of contextual factors that determine the relative appropriateness of category-based perception of ingroup and outgroup.

ETMs showed high rates of remission, with about 50% of cases being classified as noncases 2 yrs later. After LMM reanalysis, less than 14% of Ss classified as most disruptive at a given age would show remission within 2 yrs. Discrepancies were explained by errors of measurement in the original classification of behavior, resulting in the stability of disruptive behavior over time being substantially underestimated.

Data were gathered from 769 White and 190 Black adults (369 men and 610 women) who were interviewed at baseline and at 3-yr follow-up. 19% of Ss reported TEs at follow-up. A history of past exposure to TEs signaled an increase in the liability to exposure during follow-up, independent of suspected risk factors. Exploratory reanalysis suggested that the discrepancy between the retrospective and prospective results may be explained by the inclusion of childhood exposure in the lifetime retrospective inquiry. The assumption that PTSD-related TEs are random phenomena was unsupported. Ss with less education, Blacks, men, and Ss with high neuroticism and extroversion scores are more likely than others to be exposed to TEs and are at greater risk for PTSD.

Steinhilber's (see record [rid]1984-31312-001[/rid]) provocative, widely accepted analysis proposed that professional sports teams play unusually badly (choke) under the pressure created by their home fans and perform poorly in decisive home games of championship series. However, a reanalysis of the data, including the results of recent championships in baseball and basketball, finds no evidence of a home-field championship choke. The home field is an advantage, and the home team wins about as often late as early in championship series. Teams show an ability to triumph over pressure in asymmetrical "must-win" situations late in championship series. When choking occurs, it is associated with the anticipation of an important failure, not the distractions of possible success as suggested by Baumeister and Steinhilber.

Abstract = {Posits that irony, viewed as a mode of indirect negation, does not involve canceling the indirectly negated message and replacing it with the implicated one. Irony understanding involves processing both the negated and implicated messages, so that the difference between them may be computed. This view differs from the view that assumes that irony involves only 1 interpretation. Holding that irony activates both the literal/explicit and the ironic/implicated meanings predicts that irony will be more difficult to understand than a nonironic use of the same utterance. Reanalysis of previous findings by R. W. Gibbs (see record [rid]1986-16845-001[/rid]) supports this theory. Speakers apply irony for certain communicative goals that are unattainable by direct negation. Direct negation cannot point to the occasionally more desirable state of affairs indicated by the affirmative (literal) phrasing of the ironic utterance.

Milford, see record 71:00249 and Tobacyk, 1988) which measures Traditional Religion, Psi Belief, Precognition, Spiritualism, Witchcraft, Extraordinary Life Forms, and Superstition. The author contends that the present form of the PBS is based on questionable methodology, and even though the factorial structure of paranormal belief is likely to be multidimensional, it cannot be accounted for by a seven-factor simple structure, nor is it likely to be orthogonal. Reconstruction and reanalysis of the original 13-factor solution show that there are more likely to be 4 significant factors. An in-depth review of the PBS subscales shows that subscale items lacked comprehensive coverage of their constructs and are often wrongly named. It also sheds light on why the factor structure may have turned out as it did. A new PBS and a more appropriate definition of paranormal are required.

Ingelhart's (1977, 1990) notion that variation in civic culture accounts for cross-national differences in life satisfaction. It was hypothesized that Francophone Quebec has had a comparatively weak civic culture and that this has resulted in low satisfaction among its residents. Graphical analysis of general life satisfaction data confirmed this hypothesis, except in the late 1970s. A weighted least squares regression analysis, containing variables denoting 5 domains of satisfaction, reached the same conclusion. Reanalysis of the data using a gamma correlation produced similar results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Illustrates an actuarial approach to predicting sexual recidivism (SR) among known sex offenders with a reanalysis of follow-up data of 178 rapists and child molesters. Ss who had been assessed at a maximum security psychiatric facility were followed up for 50 to 88 mo. 27.5% were convicted of a new sex offense and 40% were arrested, convicted, or returned to the psychiatric facility for a violent (including sex) offense. Rapists were more likely to recidivate than child molesters. Psychopathy, measures of previous criminal history, and phallometric indexes of deviant sexual interests were useful predictors of SR. A predictor scale was formed by weighting each predictor that was significant in the regression analyses by a number reflecting its univariate correlation with the criterion. A linear relationship was found between scores on the predictor scale and reconviction for a sexual offense. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article focuses on decision processes in recognition memory. It begins with investigation of the hypothesis that the measured criterion increases systematically with the memorability of old items. Three experiments using the list-strength paradigm, and a review of the prior literature, present results consistent with this hypothesis. Several psychological models of criterion placement are examined, generating different predictions about the relative sizes of criterion shifts for strong and weak items. A range model, in which criterion placement depends on the estimated range of the old and new distributions, predicts that criterion shifts should be larger for weak items; this result emerges in a reanalysis of prior studies. The general discussion elaborates on how a focus on criterion placement can explain the mirror effect (Glanzer, Adams, Iverson, & Kim, see record [rid]1993-40158-001[/rid]) and provides a framework for testing Shiffrin, Ratcliff, and Clark's (see record [rid]1990-13917-001[/rid]) claims about why null effects of list strength occur with repetition.

Abstract = {Examined whether the experience of being cared for by a depressed mother stunts an infant's intellectual development, using prospective longitudinal data that had previously been obtained from a community sample of 119 primiparous North London women (age at entry 28 yrs), followed from early pregnancy until the children were 4 yrs old. Reanalysis of those data provided support for the original finding of an association between postnatal depression and impaired cognitive abilities in the children. Children whose mothers had been depressed showed reliably lower scores on the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at 4 yrs of age, with the perceptual performance scale most affected. The decrements were not accounted for by prenatal and perinatal experiences nor by the family's present status and climate. However, low birth weight appeared to potentiate the effect, whereas higher levels of maternal education served as a protective factor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, parallelism of the antecedent did affect the time it took readers to comprehend deep anaphors. Mauner et al reanalyzed Tanenhaus and Carlson's data and conducted 2 follow-up experiments based on the reanalysis. In the follow-up experiments, 32 Ss performed a timed make-sense judgment task on sets of sentences. Parallelism effects for deep anaphors were eliminated following short passives but not full passives. Results support the claim that deep and surface anaphors access different types of representations. The previous finding of parallelism effects for deep anaphors may be due to factors other than structural parallelism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Different processes appeared to be involved at successive phases of learning, and the efficiency or effectiveness of some of these processes was related negatively to age. The ability to remember and use feedback regarding the correctness of previous responses contributed to individual differences, especially age-related differences, in associative learning.

Abstract = {It has been calculated that monogenic genes for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) account for <10% of male MR. More than 20 genes are known to be associated with syndromic XLMR and 13 genes have so far been identified with nonsyndromic XLMR. Although the search for genes has been very active in recent years, mutations in a "major" causative gene underlying a larger proportion of unexplained XLMR remain to be identified. Recently, the identification of mutations in the Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX) in syndromic as well as non syndromic conditions created optimism that ARX could be a major gene in XLMR. In the light of the discovery of the ARX gene, reanalysis of data from a population-based study can provide information on the frequency of ARX mutations and other XLMR genes in male MR. In a cross sectional study comprising 30,037 Norwegian children (15,495 males and 14,542 females) born between 1980 and 1985 all children with MR, defined as IQ < 70 after psychometric assessments (n = 185), were identified. The study also included three pairs of brothers, one with possible autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance and two labeled familial MR. In conclusion, as a crude estimate derived from this study, the prevalence of the 24 bp ARX mutation in male MR is 1%, or less, and is perhaps one-third to half as common as the fragile X syndrome.

Abstract = {Stimulated by the 1994 publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), this article briefly traces the history of the DSMs, describes the goals and process for preparing DSM-IV (literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field trials), and examines the major changes between DSM-IV and its predecessor.

Abstract = {Proposes the introduction of a 5-syndrome model of schizophrenic psychopathology based on a reanalysis of factor analytic procedures used on 240 schizophrenics assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Data on a 5-factor solution appear to best fit the psychopathological data and are supported by 3 independent and comparable factor analyses; negative, positive, excitement, cognitive, and depression/anxiety domains of psychopathology give patients their individual mark. The 5-factor model shows stability over different degrees of schizophrenic psychopathology and may be relatively state independent. It also shows stability across age groups and cultures, and is relatively independent from medication effects. The authors demonstrated specific correlates of these components with demographic and family history variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the reliability, discriminant validity, and construct validity of L. C. Morey's (1991) Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) within the Australian context. Ss included 151 normals, 30 alcoholics, and 30 schizophrenic patients. A subsample of 70 nonpsychiatric adults responded to the PAI items twice over a test–retest interval of 28 days. The resulting median retest coefficient was 0.7, indicating less than optimal stability. The median alpha coefficient was 0.8, suggesting somewhat narrow measurement scales. A higher-order scale factoring did not strongly support the purported PAI structure. In reanalyses of the correlation matrices included in the Professional Manual, the purported PAI factor structure was unable to be replicated for the standardization clinical sample, and a confirmatory factor analysis using the normative correlational data revealed poor fit indices.

Abstract = {Examined the construct validity of the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ) in Ss with non-life-threatening chronic illness or disability, namely 655 community-residing adults (aged 19–82 yrs) with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The 8-factor model that was originally developed with a community-residing well population did not adequately describe coping for individuals with a chronic illness or disability that was not life-threatening. A reanalysis of the factor structure identified 3 coping factors: cognitive reframing, emotional respite, and direct assistance. Clinical observations suggest that these Ss may use coping behaviors not measured by the WCQ. Thus, the coping strategies in the WCQ may have different meanings and measure different constructs depending on the study population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two empirical judgment phenomena appear to contradict each other. In the revision-of-opinion literature, subjective probability (SP) judgments have been analyzed as a function of objective probability (OP) and generally have been found to be conservative, that is, to represent underconfidence. In the calibration literature, analyses of OP (operationalized as relative frequency correct) as a function of SP have led to the opposite conclusion, that judgment is generally overconfident. Reanalysis of 3 studies shows that both results can be obtained from the same set of data, depending on the method of analysis. The simultaneous effects are then generated and factors influencing them are explored by means of a model that instantiates a very general theory of how SP estimates arise from true judgments perturbed by random error. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Due to selection effects arising from strategic behavior, measures of the relative strength of a defender's interests that are available before a crisis begins (ex ante) should be related to the failure of the defender's threats during the crisis. Ex ante measures of the defender's relative military strength should correlate with the success of the defender's crisis threats, but due to strategic dynamics that are not grasped by the standard arguments. A reanalysis of P. Huth and B. Russett's (1984, 1988) data on immediate deterrent threats lends support for these and other hypotheses drawn from the GT treatment.

Orford et al, 1976). At 24 mo, Ss were assigned to a good, equivocal, or bad category of drinking behavior and patients were defined as gamma or non-gamma (E. M. Jellinek, 1960). No gamma patients in the advice-only group had done well, but a majority of non-gamma patients receiving advice only had done well. In a reanalysis, the focus was on behavior in the 1st, rather than the 2nd, 12-mo period following treatment. Results indicate an absence of any matching interactions such as those previously reported and suggest that a division between gamma, delta, and epsilon on one hand, and alpha on the other, would set up a dichotomy more consistent with dependence ratings.

The reanalysis suggests that despite the CRVP's placatory conclusion, a majority of copy-test measures examined in the CRVP clearly can be rejected for general use. Liking's importance has been overstated: Of those measures that survive the decision rule of 90% correct predictions and significantly above-chance prediction at the 10% level of significance, about half involve ad likability but half do not. Moreover, additional tests following the CRVP suggest that liking, too, fails as a general measure and that a better candidate appears to be pre/post persuasion.

Abstract = {Comments on the D. E. Baer and R. D. Lambert (see record [rid]1991-18229-001[/rid]) reanalysis of 1983 Canadian survey data, which argues that the ideological effects of university education are unidirectional, serving to reinforce the dominant ideology. They further claim to have "convincingly demonstrated" that university studies in the social sciences do not have the opposite effect (i.e., that Canadian social scientists, far from being radicals, are probably more conservative than the population at large), and that their findings contradict the conclusion of S. Guimond et al (see record [rid]1989-41293-001[/rid]). It is argued that there is solid evidence that studying the social sciences is related to a liberalization of students' attitudes, evidence that is in no way contradicted by the Baer and Lambert results.

Abstract = {Attempts to overcome the problem of computing indices of accuracy (such as sensitivity and specificity) for psychiatric diagnoses in the absence of a "gold standard" of comparison. A literature review reveals that a lack of gold standards of accuracy in psychiatry has been addressed with a variety of novel analytical procedures. Most methods are variants of latent class analysis. A reanalysis of data from 1 reviewed paper shows that similar inferences about accuracy of diagnoses could be drawn from a conventional latent class analysis. Nosologists are urged to consider the use of latent structure methods in assessing the adequacy of psychiatric diagnoses because these methods provide information about diagnostic accuracy that would be useful in both clinical practice and research settings.

Abstract = {Reanalyzed data on 285 factory workers gathered by D. E. Broadbent and D. Gath (1979, 1981) and D. E. Broadbent (1981) to study psychiatric symptom levels in particular jobs. Original data include a measure of cognitive failure (self-reports of attention and memory failures in everyday life), which was used in the reanalysis. There was no evidence of cognitive failures being higher or lower in certain jobs. The correlations between cognitive failure and anxiety were markedly higher in repetitive work allowing little control to the individual. Within the limits of the study, the correlation was not particularly high in groups with pacing or low levels of leisure satisfaction. It seems likely therefore that cognitive failure is a sign primarily of vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms in jobs of low discretion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Using a relatively sophisticated multidimensional framework for classifying level of structure, the authors obtained results from a meta-analysis of 114 entry-level interview validity coefficients suggesting that (1) structure is a major moderator of interview validity; (2) interviews, particularly when structured, can reach levels of validity that are comparable to those of mental ability tests; and (3) although validity does increase through much of the range of structure, there is a point at which additional structure yields essentially no incremental validity. Thus, results suggested a ceiling effect for structure. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Exp 4 tested a hypothesis as to why groups using the computer-based idea generation system outperformed nominal groups of 72 upper-division business students.

Bion, whom he never met and who died in 1987. Just as Freud's psychoanalysis emphasizes sexuality, J. Lacan's emphasizes language, and M. Klein's emphasizes childhood affects, by the same token, Bion's is a psychoanalysis of thought. From Bion's "lessons," the analyst learns to grow and to be. Among other things, he/she learns the criteria of good interpretation (i.e., truth, vitality, mind expansion, and rejection of dogmatism, intolerance, authoritarianism, and moralizing). Other aspects of analyst formation to be learned from Bion include self-analysis, reanalysis, and constant revision of the latter.

Abstract = {Used available literature to assess the observation that Ashkenazi Jews (Jews having European ancestry) have higher rates of affective disorders than either Sephardi or Oriental Jews. Statistical reanalysis of these studies, spanning over 50 yrs, was consistent with rates being elevated for Ashkenazim. Results of these treatment-based studies, however, suffer from biases due to differential help-seeking patterns, lack of accounting for readmission rates, diagnostic unreliability, misuse of frequency ratios relative to other disorders, and failure to control for confounding variables. As a result of these causes for biases and in the absence of a true incidence or prevalence study serving as a basis for these observations, the assumption that Ashkenazim are at an increased risk for affective disorders is questionable and may be a mere result of methodological artifacts.

Abstract = {A. P.

Reanalysis of the data shows that there was an effect of reinforcement in the alternative component of the schedule independent of the shifts in reinforcers between components. Thus, the effect of relative rate of reinforcement cannot be ascribed, at least entirely, to the mechanisms proposed by the behavioral competition theory of contrast.

This observation appears contradictory to the 1st study on long-term spontaneous turning behavior in healthy participants (H. S. Bracha, D. J. Seitz, J. Otemaa, & S. D.

(2003) argued that the differentiation of the population in hemisphere-dominant groups by a compound measure of hand-foot-eye preference might have masked their recent finding. Thus, this commentary presents a reanalysis of the original data set (H. S. Bracha et al., 1987). Replicating recent observation, right-handers preferred left-sided turns; and non-righthanders, right-sided turns. This replication strengthens the proposition that handedness and turning behavior might depend on interhemispheric dopamine asymmetries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Clark (see PA, Vols 78:27347 and 79:18429) that the negative affects (fear, sadness, hostility, and guilt) are organized in a hierarchical structure and at the same time achieve discriminant validity. These reanalyses of the data in Watson and Clark provide strong support for both the hierarchical representation of the negative affects under a single valence factor and convergent validity. However, although weak support exists for discriminant validity of self-report measures of the negative affects, discriminant validity is rejected when the negative affects are measured either with self- and peer-reports or self-reports over time treated as 2 methods. Limitations of Watson and Clark's procedures are pointed out, and the advantages of new methods are described. A rationale is provided for the interaction of traits and methods, where support is found in 1 of 4 data sets investigated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two studies examined the personality correlates of human values, using the Social Values Inventory and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire—Revised (EPQ—R). The 1st study was conducted among 89 undergraduates; the 2nd study is a reanalysis of data from 16–18 yr olds, previously reported by P. C. L. Heaven and A. Furnham (see record [rid]1992-12320-001[/rid]). The results of canonical correlation analysis indicate that Eysenckian Psychoticism (P), Extraversion, and Neuroticism interacted in complex ways in predicting the endorsement of values. Certain value correlates of personality types are noted. Also, emotionally stable high P-scores were distinguishable from emotionally stable introverts. Results suggest that Eysenckian dimensions are useful in distinguishing values. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Tested whether the statistically significant results of a randomized clinical trial of an inpatient family intervention were clinically significant for hospital practice by reanalyzing outcome data using a measure of clinical significance based on the extent to which patients had recovered during the course of the intervention. 169 hospitalized Ss (78 males, 91 females) and their families were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational inpatient family intervention or to a comparison group. Patient and family outcome measures were assessed at admission, discharge, and 6 and 18 mo after admission. The reanalysis confirmed that inpatient family intervention was associated with clinically significant improvement at discharge, especially for female patients and patients with chronic schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These effects were maintained 6 mo after admission before attenuating at 18 mo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Ss (aged 52–83 yrs) named 30 famous people 4 times over the course of an hour and responded to 2 targets (a beard and a pipe) by marking the trial number on the response sheet. Initial performance in the prospective memory task was related only to a measure of incidental learning. Subsequent forgetting (i.e., success followed by failure) occurred more often for older Ss than for younger Ss, but there was no difference between the age groups in recovery (i.e., failure followed by success). Forgetting was predicted by age, even after a composite measure of general ability was included in the regression. Recovery was related to general ability alone. Results both replicate and extend those from a reanalysis of a previous study (E. A. Maylor, 1990). They provide a striking contrast with the effect of age on retrospective memory, namely, age-related impairment on initial performance but no effect of age on subsequent forgetting.

Results show that estimated distance is a linear function of the visual angle between objects as well as of the true distance. In Exp 2, Ss estimated 6 interobject distances from 12 viewing positions. Results show that visual angle predicted estimated distance independently of how the change in visual angle came about, suggesting that the greater the visual angle between objects, the more their separation is overestimated.

Abstract = {Presents a methodological case study of J. P. Rushton's (1988) theory of racial differences. Contrary to Rushton's postulates, aggregating large cohorts of methodologically weak studies leads to misleading conclusions. The review of data shows that nonprofessional skull collections were included (race was possibly estimated from skull size) and that the impact of factors, such as infant malnutrition and climate, on cranial or brain size was ignored. Statistical reanalyses of cranial data show that cranial size (1) is not a viable indicator of intelligence and (2) is similar in Negroids and Caucasoids from the same settings. It varies with the standard of living and climate (smaller crania are found in underdeveloped, warmer countries), not with race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Indicates that the Gaussian, or "normal," distribution is routinely used to model distributions of subjective quantities. This practice rests on a trust in the central limit theorem; however, this theorem does not cover the case of a mixture of Gaussian distributions with different standard deviations. In psychophysical judgment experiments, this may result from fluctuating or interindividually varying attention. Two candidates for describing this type of distribution are the logistic distribution and the t distribution with a small number of degrees of freedom. In reanalyses of A. Hellström's experimental data (see record [rid]1980-27097-001[/rid]) on 3-category loudness comparisons, and in a Monte Carlo simulation, t(4) was found to model the underlying mixed inter- and intraindividual distribution of subjective loudness differences satisfactorily.

Abstract = {Examined the structure of the Gross Cohesiveness Scale (GCS) by E. F. Gross (1957) and used parallel analysis by J. L. Horn (1965) for selecting the number of components to retain. Based on critical review of the results of 3 empirical reports and reanalyses of the results of 2 of these studies, it was concluded that Gross's measure is unidimensional. However, it was not possible to evaluate the adequacy of a 1-factor solution across 2 samples with the same version of the measure. Without this information, one cannot be certain that a unidimensional structure would replicate. Gross's measure should be scored using a single summary scale score because this strategy is most consistent with the empirical evidence. These findings regarding the factor structure of the GCS should not be extrapolated to address the dimensionality of the construct of group cohesion, however.

Two experiments were designed to fill this gap, where garden path sentences in Japanese were used and the marker demanding reanalysis of a previously established syntactic structure appeared at the end of these sentences. 48 university students were given a probe verb from an embedded clause and required to quickly identify the subject whose syntactic role could be confirmed only when they later encountered the marker. Findings indicate that parsers cannot immediately reconstruct the previous syntactic structure but need a certain period of time to reach a final decision.

The 2 groups, which are in limited contact in southwestern Maine, are defined by uniquely derived behavioral (song-related) characteristics, and by differences in morphology (bill size and ventral streakiness) and habitat.

A simulation analysis, as well as a reanalysis of an actual application, shows that partial information about weights is often not sufficient to determine the most preferred alternative for realistic decision problems. Hence, approximation procedures for specifying weights may lead to errors. However, a simple analysis procedure can be used to accurately determine whether partial information about weights is adequate to correctly specify the most preferred alternative. This procedure can be useful for identifying situations in which detailed elicitation of weights is not needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Claims of the facial feedback hypothesis (FFH) of emotional behavior are counterintuitive and controversial. Evidence for the FFH is reviewed. Empirical evidence and theoretical speculation seem to be of sufficient strength to warrant confidence in the reliability of the FFH. The FFH is applied to the interpersonal context by noting the evidence for the imitation of facial expressions in both adults and infants. The interpersonal FFH holds that in face-to-face contexts, the hedonic tone of facial displays achieved through imitation should influence the underlying affect experienced by the partners. The link between facial imitation and affect can account, in part, for their attraction to the partner and situation. A reanalysis of previous data provides evidence for the imitation of smiles in conversation among various types of dyads and for an independent effect of a person's own smiles on his or her own attraction to the partner.

Abstract = {Studied the assessment of convergent and discriminant validity in personality research by contrasting 4 approaches for the analysis of classic multitrait-multimethod data, in which 3 or more traits are measured with indicators derived from 3 or more methods. The approaches are the criteria of D. T. Campbell and D. Fiske (1959), the confirmatory factor analysis model (K. G. Jöreskog, 1974), the correlated uniqueness model (H. W. Marsh, 1989), and the direct product model (M. W. Browne, 1989). Pros and cons of the approaches are pointed out through a reanalysis of data originally collected by M. Van Tuinen and N. V. Ramanaiah (1979) in which global self-esteem, social self-esteem, and orderliness were each measured by true–false inventories, multipoint inventories, and simple self-reports. Guidelines for choosing among the approaches and procedures for nontraditional multitrait-multimethod data are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conducted 3 experiments with 224 undergraduates to explore how Ss' preferences for complements of particular verbs affect the on-line processing of sentences. Exp 1 gathered binary preference choices for several verb types and their complements; Exps 2 and 3 used these preference choices and showed that an S's preference for a verb's complements affects an initial parse in sentences that do not contain obvious structural ambiguities. Data are discussed in terms of the lexical entry-driven and phrase structure-driven models of sentence processing. Lexical information is used during the initial analysis of a sentence to set up possible paths the parser might take; when the structure of the sentence is incongruent with an S's preference, sentence processing performance is disrupted and reanalysis must occur.

It is argued that this reanalysis was conceptually and technically flawed, and that Schoorman's original analysis yielded the correct (negative) conclusion. Schoorman et al also discussed a variety of alternatives for conducting a factorial analysis of variance with unequal cell sizes, demonstrating that different procedures can lead to different statistical conclusions. However, their discussion is misleading and overlooks recent literature that has removed much of the mystery from the unequal-n problem. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

The Cognitive Skills Inventory by V. Moreno and F. J. Di Vesta (see record [rid]1991-28920-001[/rid]) was used. SAs were viewed as cognitive activities peculiar to the specific purposes and demands of academic settings.

When such data were unavailable, reanalysis of data sets collected for other studies, as well as focused field trials, were conducted to examine specific diagnostic issues. Anticipated changes in several diagnostic areas such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, panic disorder, and substance abuse and dependence are discussed.

Evidence about the association of alcohol disorder and unemployment comes from 2 studies. The first is a reanalysis of data on 722 unemployed men gathered in a survey by B. S. Rowntree and B. Lasker (1911). The second analyzes epidemiologic catchment area data collected in the 1980s (W. W. Eaton and L. G. Kessler, 1985; L. N. Robins and D. A. Regier, 1991). Results from both studies support both drift and social causation processes and demonstrate that at least 1 diagnosis-specific psychopathology is linked to unemployment.

Analyses revealed that late talkers used significantly more CGs and for a greater variety of communicative functions than did LMCs. However, a 1-yr follow-up revealed that 4 of the late talkers remained delayed (truly delayed late talkers) and 6 caught up (late bloomers). Reanalyses of Year 1 data based on these follow-up outcomes demonstrated that only late bloomers used more CGs. Truly delayed late talkers did not differ from LCMs either for number of gestures, type of gestures (symbolic vs nonsymbolic), or number of different functions for which gestures were used. Late bloomers also used more CGs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Frequency, prototypicality, and imageability had no independent effect. In Exp 2, Ss classified objects into 2 semantic categories (natural or man-made). Prototypicality and semantic category were the only variables to have a significant effect on reaction time (RT), with no effect of age of acquisition, frequency, imageability, or word length.

Generally, respondents regarded the increasing liberty in psychoanalytic practice as beneficial. Shifts occurred largely in the area of interpretation. Those who had decreased the number of interpretations felt that their interpretations were broader and more incisive. For many respondents, psychoanalysis had been redefined, and many had combined their earlier techniques with a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy. "Classical" analysts had often suffered because of their disinclination toward psychotherapy, family treatment, or crisis work. About one-third of the sample had undergone reanalysis. Memory loss, age discrimination, and general depression were also addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Undermatching was the most common relationship observed. No consistent bias was shown. An analysis of moderating variables also revealed that the laboratory in which an experiment was conducted and the year of publication were related to the sensitivity parameter.

Abstract = {Assessed the association of young age at treatment, cranial irradiation, and time since treatment with intellectual deterioration among 49 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia. Ss had been randomized to receive low-dose cranial radiation therapy or high-dose chemotherapy. Longitudinal assessments of intellect were conducted. No significant effects of treatment group or age at treatment were detected. A small but statistically significant decline in mean full-scale IQ was noted over time (M = –3.6). Reanalysis with IQ test version included as a covariate eliminated IQ declines found initially. Results suggest that there has been reduced toxicity of these methods of treatment and that the magnitude and direction of error introduced by changing tests may approximate the magnitude of adverse effects on IQ expected from treatment.

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of the concept of psychological equity as a principle of distributive justice, attempts to accommodate the assumptions of equity theorists within an algebraic formula have been the source of much controversy. In this article shortcomings with existing formulas are discussed, and a ratio equity formula is proposed, together with a supporting rationale. The formula describes "perfect equity" such that it is possible to describe with some precision "degrees of inequity." A reanalysis of previous empirical data from R. J. Harris (see record [rid]1981-05385-001[/rid]) is presented as evidence for the practical utility of this formula. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {R. A. Rescorla's (1969) recommendations concerning the logical and empirical operations for inferring Pavlovian conditioned inhibition were examined in light of modern comparison theories of Pavlovian conditioning and new data that question whether excitation and inhibition are opposite ends of a single continuum of associative strength. This reanalysis confirms Rescorla's dictum that the summation and retardation tests are a sufficient basis for inferring inhibition. No theoretical or empirical challenges since 1969 undermine the heuristic or explanatory power of that concept. However, passing both of the 2 operational tests may not be necessary: A conditioned stimulus/stimuli (CS) may be inhibitory, yet may not pass one or the other test. Recent changes in the conception of inhibition are also reviewed, and it is suggested that there may be other forms of associatively based inhibition that are not at all antagonistic to excitation.

Abstract = {Reanalyzed data from a study by B. M. Byrne (1989; see also PA, Vol 77:16093) to demonstrate that the general model typically used in the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach to the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) model may lead to inappropriate interpretations even when it converges to a proper solution. The reanalysis suggests that there is reasonable support for the invariance of the MTMM solutions across groups of high school students in high- vs low-ability tracks. Data fit a CFA model positing correlated trait factors and methods as correlated uniquenesses better than the general CFA model positing correlated trait and correlated method (CTCM) factors. The CTCM model was so unstable that it provided many inconsistent solutions that were similar in their ability to fit the data; thus, this model seems to suffer from indeterminacy problems typically associated with exploratory factor analysis.

Introjective patients, whose pathology focuses on issues of self-definition, autonomy, and self-worth and who use mainly counteractive defenses, have significantly greater positive change in PSA. The clinical implications of patient-by-treatment interactions are discussed, and the importance of differentiating among types of patients in studies of therapeutic process and outcome is stressed.

Results corroborate a previously established effect of current tempo on perceived activity, the nonmonotonic effect of current tempo on affect, and the rightward shift of this preference function due to increases in situational arousal. These findings are extended by showing (1) a contrast effect in which slower prior tempos raise the level of current perceived activity, and (2) an intervening role for perceived activity in partially mediating the effects of current tempo and fully mediating the effects of prior tempo on affect.

The paper begins by reviewing some of the existing models of debugging and their assumptions, before looking in more detail at one of the dominant paradigms for investigating debugging, that of predicting bug detection success. A reanalysis of the bug detection data from D. J. Gilmore and T. R. Green (see record [rid]1989-14376-001[/rid]) provides evidence that the assumptions of existing models are not valid. The important part of this result is the realization that these assumptions have been derived from a view of debugging as fault diagnosis, rather than as a critical component of design. The paper describes the important features of debugging as a design activity, before outlining some predictions and implications which can be derived from the model.

The stimuli were 2-clause sentences containing an ambiguous noun phrase which could function as either the object of the 1st clause or the subject of the 2nd. In Exps 1 and 2, reanalysis of garden-path sentences was more difficult with a longer ambiguous phrase. Exp 3 showed that this effect of phrase length is not attributable to the greater syntactic complexity of longer phrases. Exps 4 and 5 found that ambiguous phrases made long by the addition of prenominal adjectives were easy to reanalyze, but phrases made long by the addition of postnominal modifying prepositional phrases or relative clauses were hard to reanalyze.

Abstract = {Argues that because they employed a statistical procedure that was inappropriate for the purpose, J. H. Kranzler and A. R. Jensen (see record [rid]1992-34980-001[/rid]) have not demonstrated that a factor of general intelligence, g, depends on a number of independent processes. It is more parsimonious to interpret their results in terms of a g that is unitary. A factorial reanalysis of their data, including cross-correlations between psychometric variables and variables from elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs), shows that many ECT variables, especially those reflecting decision time rather than movement time, have substantial loadings on a 2nd-order general factor. This factor is orthogonal to a 2nd-order factor representing general speed of movement from a home button to a response button in ECTs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Klerman et al (1978) on 523 Ss with affective disorders and their 2,289 1st-degree relatives. Based on reanalysis of the data, gender differences in depression among people 40 yrs of age and older were high among cohorts that reached adolescence during periods of increasing opportunities for female achievement. Among cohorts that reached adolescence during periods of stable or decreasing opportunities for women, gender differences in depression were not significant at any age. Results also suggest that women may exhibit symptoms of depression during adolescence but do not develop full clinical depression until after 30 yrs of age.

Abstract = {Compares and contrasts classic and contemporary methods for analyzing construct validity through reanalyses of data from the organizational research literature to establish a basis for assessing the validity of measures used in organizational research. D. T. Campbell and D. W. Fiske's (1959) criteria are found to be lacking, particularly in their assumptions, diagnostic information, and power. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is shown to overcome most limitations inherent in Campbell and Fiske's procedures. Nevertheless, 2 potential shortcomings are identified with the CFA method: the confounding of random error with measure-specific variance and the inability to test for interactions between traits and methods. Three alternative methods are presented for addressing the former issue, and the direct product model (M. W. Browne; see record [rid]1984-24964-001[/rid]) is described as a solution to the latter.

Although the MAB Full Scale IQ seems to be a valid measure of general mental ability, the construct validity of the Verbal and Performance scale IQs is not supported. Therefore, the Verbal and Performance IQs should be interpreted with caution, if at all. In addition, reanalysis of previous investigations of the MAB underscores the importance of ascertaining the reading level of Ss prior to administration of the MAB. Marginal reading proficiency, especially on a timed paper-and-pencil test such as the MAB, will confound results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Authors were asked to rank 10 outlier detection techniques in industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology. Results show a disagreement among researchers as to the appropriateness of deleting data points from a study and greater use of visual examination of data than of numeric diagnostic techniques for detecting outliers. The reanalysis showed that while outlier removal influenced effect size measures in individual studies, outlying data points were not found to be a substantial source of variance.

The major emphasis in the preparation of the DSM-IV has been to maximize the impact of this accumulating research on the revision and to document the rationale and empirical support for any changes that are made. In this article we discuss the empirical basis for the DSM-IV. The historical context provided by the previous editions is briefly presented and followed by a description of the process by which the DSM-IV is being constructed. The input of empirical data through literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field trials is described, and an illustration with the antisocial personality disorder diagnosis is given.

A reanalysis of Rushton's data reveals that the use of means across 24 military samples rather than individual values within each sample grossly inflates the influence of body weight on relative brain size. The CCs in this sample have larger absolute cranial capacity and body weight than the MGs. Only after applying an inappropriate statistical correction for body weight does the relative brain-size advantage in MGs emerge. The lighter North American CSs, in comparison to the heavier CC samples, also have significantly greater relative cranial capacity. Because the relative brain-size pattern can be reproduced within the CCs simply by dividing them according to body weight, there is no justification for claiming a relative brain-size difference between races.

Structural equation analyses revealed that the convergent validity of measures of gladness is not satisfactory, whereas it is mixed for measures of elation and joy. With respect to discriminant validity, the 3 emotions are shown to be distinct on the basis of a strict statistical interpretation. The disattenuated correlation between gladness and joy suggests that these emotions are quite similar from a practical standpoint. Responses of Ss could be explained by a model hypothesizing additive effects for affective status and the components underlying them. The findings are interpreted from the perspective of research on the categorization of emotions and the degree of shared reality-based expectations among measures of elation, gladness, and joy.

Two telephone interviews concerned attitudes on abortion and welfare, and items regarding happiness. According to the subtraction hypothesis, when a general question about happiness follows a question on marital happiness, Ss take the item to ask about aspects of their lives other than their marriages (in effect, the Ss subtract their marriages in answering the general question). Results support this hypothesis. However, reanalysis of the studies (e.g., N. Schwarz et al; see record [rid]1991-23777-001[/rid]) that originally demonstrated the impact of the order of the 2 happiness items casts doubt on the subtraction hypothesis and related models (e.g., H.

Mendlewicz and J. L. Fless (1972, 1974) and Mendlewicz et al (1975). The linkage implied by this reanalysis is spurious, since the 2 markers are at opposite ends of the X chromosome. This spurious linkage appears to be a result of systematic genotyping errors. The support provided by these data to the X-linkage hypothesis in BP illness is thus diminished (i.e., the linkage to illness may depend on systematic errors in marker genotyping). The possible causes of inconsistency between linkage reports are statistical or systematic. Consistency of the marker map in a particular study with the known marker map is one test for systematic errors in genotyping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {When repeated observations are taken at equal time intervals, a simple form of a stationary time series structure may be fitted to the observations. S. Wallenstein and J. L. Fleiss (see record [rid]1980-26963-001[/rid]) have shown that the degrees-of-freedom correction factor for time effects has a higher lowerbound for data with a serial correlation pattern (or a simplex pattern [SP]) than for data without such a structure. Reanalysis of the example data found in E. M. Hearne et al (1983) indicated that the correction factor from a patterned matrix could be smaller than the counterpart without fitting a simplex pattern. An example illustrates the computational steps in obtaining these 2 correction factors. A simulation study determined the conditions under which fitting a simplex pattern would be advantageous over not assuming such a pattern. Fitting a serial correlation pattern did not always produce more powerful tests of time effects than not assuming such a pattern. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reanalyzed data from the literature on the effect of lesions on visual recognition memory in macaques. On the basis of percentage scores, the published data can be interpreted as showing that the ability to recognize a previously seen object decayed faster in Ss with brain lesions than it did in normal Ss. A reanalysis of the extensive data in terms of d′ of signal detection theory or by arcsine transform suggests, on the contrary, that the rate of decay from 0 to 600 sec was essentially the same in normal Ss and in those with lesions (particularly temporal lobe lesions). In d′ or arcsine terms, the effect of the lesions was fully developed at the shortest times used and showed no increase as a function of the delay between initial presentation and test. Thus, very different conclusions stem from the choice of scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Technical reasons are presented as to why therapist should be included as a random design factor in the nested analysis of (co)variance (AN[C]OVA) design commonly used in psychotherapy research. Incorrect specification of the ANOVA design can, under some circumstances, result in incorrect estimation of the error term, overly liberal F ratios, and an unacceptably high risk of Type I errors. Review of studies indicates that the great majority of investigators continue to ignore this issue. Computer simulation studies revealed that considerable bias can be introduced by not specifying therapist as a random term. Finally, a reanalysis is presented of data from 10 psychotherapy outcome studies that indicated that therapist effects vary considerably and at times can be large. More recent studies that implement better quality controls appear to demonstrate less variance due to therapist. The implications of these results for the design of future studies are discussed.

Abstract = {To determine if neuroleptic treatment changes the natural course of schizophrenia, 22 studies were reviewed in which relatively similar patients were or were not given neuroleptics at specific times during the course of their illnesses. Nineteen of the studies were from first- or predominately first-break populations. While there was little consensus among the authors of the studies reviewed, a reanalysis of the data indicates that early intervention with neuroleptics in first-break schizophrenic patients increases the likelihood of an improved long-term course. This finding is similar to that of earlier investigators who indicated there was a decrease in patients with the more severe forms of the illness following the introduction of convulsive therapies. Furthermore, there is evidence that stable schizophrenic patients whose neuroleptics are discontinued and have relapses may have a difficult time returning to their previous level of function. The findings described in this paper have implications for both the treatment of schizophrenia and for understanding the pathophysiological processes that determine the course of the disorder.

The 1st analysis was conducted on previously published data. The tendency of results is in line with predictions based on Atkinson's theory: Ms makes a difference. Reanalysis of a new set of data also supported the general assumption that Ms makes a contribution in addition to the contribution made by test anxiety.

Reanalyses indicate that method variance in these studies is more prevalent than Spector concluded but less prevalent than Williams et al asserted.

This analysis reveals that although "fluid" intelligence declines with age, there are no systematic age-related changes in "crystallized" intelligence. It is noted that K. W.

Abstract = {Investigated age group differences in working memory capacity by examining the effects of word length on adults' recall span and repetition rate. 22 college students and 60 adults (aged 60–94 yrs) recalled lists of 1-, 2-, or 3-syllable words and repeated aloud pairs of 1-, 2-, or 3-syllable words. Word recall spans and word repetition rates were computed. Main effects of age group and word length were obtained on both measures, although the interactions were not significant. A 2nd analysis examined the relationship between individuals' recall span and their repetition rate. Across all age groups combined, recall span was a linear function of repetition rate and accounted for 25% of the variance on the recall task. A reanalysis of the word repetitions revealed that older adults' word durations and inter-word pauses are longer than those of young adults.

Conceptual difficulties are also noted in that the proposed checks for indeterminacy do not classify appropriately all versions of the linear syllogism. Post hoc analyses implicate linguistic processes in the selection of answers to certain forms of indeterminate problems, and this form of processing cannot be accommodated under the mixed model.

The results of the first two experiments supported L. Frazier and K.

The third experiment indicated that the cumulative version of the self-paced paradigm is not appropriate for studying on-line parsing. We conclude that verb information is not used by the parser to modify its initial parsing strategies, although it may be used to guide subsequent reanalysis.

Bernard et al asked informants to rate the frequency with which they interacted with others. In addition to these subjective data, observational data were collected. These 2 types of data permit measurement of both internal and external accuracy. Internal accuracy measures the extent to which the subjective ratings made by one person correspond to those made by another. External accuracy measures the extent to which the subjective ratings of interaction frequency correspond to the observed interaction frequency (IF). In contrast with the findings of Bernard et al, this reanalysis shows that informants report IFs accurately, especially at the dyadic level.

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to examine the factors leading to poor calibration of comprehension. In Experiment 1, the basic finding of poor calibration was replicated with paragraphs from which a single inference verification was the test of comprehension. It was shown that this lack of calibration could not be attributed to subjects' answering the inferences on the basis of previous world knowledge. Experiment 2 demonstrated that previous studies which assess comprehension with a single inference per text seriously underestimate the level of calibration. As the number of test items per text increases, so does the level of calibration. Finally, mathematical simulations demonstrate that even when the underlying calibration curves are identical, simply adding items to the comprehension test will produce a higher and more reliable estimate of calibration of comprehension. Reanalysis of these data shows that this effect is a formal property of the measures and not simply a psychological testing effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {R. J. Sternberg and his co-workers (1989, 1987) developed a new taxonomy of conflict management styles that ignores an earlier, related model proposed by R. R. Blake and J. S. Mouton (1964, 1970), K. W. Thomas (1976), and M. A. Rahim (1983). Following a critical review of Sternberg's taxonomy, the present paper presents a reanalysis of some of Sternberg's data that attempts to integrate the 2 taxonomies. The results confirm Thomas's identification of integrative and distributive dimensions underlying the typology of conflict styles. Sternberg's style of involving outsiders is interpreted as a "Pyrrhic victory," which loads low on the integrative dimension and high on the distributive dimension. The study is interpreted as providing evidence for the need to replace the concept of conflict style as a specific form of behavioral tendency by treating style as a broad pattern of behavioral tendencies.

Ss expecting to perform successfully anticipated a positive evaluation from an audience, resulting in improved performance over Ss working alone. Conversely, when Ss expected to perform poorly a negative evaluation was anticipated from an audience. However, a comparison with a performance baseline condition, and a reanalysis of data from Ss who did not receive preliminary performance feedback, indicated that both social facilitation and impairment effects were evident.

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by Oberauer et al (Intelligence. Vol 31(2) 2003, 167-193). The authors regret that upon a reanalysis they found that Model 2 (as displayed in Fig. 2 of the original article) did not fit the data adequately (two errors were estimated to be zero or negative). A model with an adequate fit, obtained through fixing the loadings of DT verbal and DT numerical on the verbal-numerical factor to zero is displayed as follows. This model had an excellent fit with Chi²(44)=40.9, CFI=1.0, RMSEA=0. The content factors, however, had to be reduced in scope to such a degree that they believe that a model without them provides a theoretically more adequate representation of the data. That model, with three functional factors and correlated errors between verbal and numerical monitoring, and between verbal and numerical dual-tasks, but without content factors, had a good fit as well, Chi²(49)=53.07, CFI=.988, RMSEA=.025. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2003-01489-008[/rid].) Working memory capacity was differentiated along functional and content-related facets.

Abstract = {On the basis of a reanalysis of the French natural history cohort of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, researchers put forth a unifying hypotheses that the emergence of the progressive phase of might just be an effect of age, rather than the effect of a change in the pathogeny of the disease. The authors in this article envision multiple sclerosis as a disease in which the times to reach disability milestones, and the ages at which these landmarks are reached, follow a predefined schedule not obviously influenced by relapses, whenever they occur, or by the initial course of the disease. Consequently, any comparison between relapse-onset patients and progressive-onset patients is significantly confounded by this difference in age at first symptom between groups. In the present circumstance, because relapse-onset patients are significantly younger than progression-onset patients, they will reach their disability milestones artificially early compared with a cohort of relapse-onset patients with an age distribution similar to the progression-onset patients.

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by Ray W. Cooksey and Geoffrey N. Soutar (Organizational Research Methods, 2006[January], Vol 9[1], 78-98). Table 3, "Promax-Rotated Pattern and Correlation Matrices From Principal Components Analysis of the Well-Being Scale Completed by Accountants," appeared incorrectly in the original article, and this erratum contains a corrected table. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2005-15947-005[/rid].) Summated scales are widely used in management research to measure constructs such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment. This article suggests that Revelle's (1979) coefficient beta, implemented in Revelle's (1978) ICLUST item-clustering procedure, should be used in conjunction with Cronbach's coefficient alpha measure of internal consistency as criteria for judging the dimensionality and internal homogeneity of summated scales. The approach is demonstrated using ICLUST reanalyses of sample responses to Warr's (1990) affective well-being scale and O'Brien, Dowling, and Kabanoff's (1978) job satisfaction scale. Coefficient beta and item clustering are shown to more clearly identify the homogeneity and internal dimensional structure of summated scale constructs than do traditional principal components analyses. Given these benefits, Revelle's approach is a viable alternative methodology for scale construction in management, organizational, and cross-cultural contexts, especially when researchers need to make defensible choices between using whole scales or subscales.

This letter reports a reanalysis of data from part of an earlier study (D. L. Pauls et al, 1991) in an attempt to replicate the findings from the Japanese study. Data was derived from male and female probands (mean age 12.9 yrs) with severe perinatal problems including: GTS, chronic multiple tics (CMT), self-injurious tics, phonic tics, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). 20 probands (43.5%) were judged to have severe tic symptoms. 11 of 146 first-degree relatives met criteria for GTS, yielding an age corrected rate of 8 ± 2%. 46 relatives satisfied criteria for GTS, CMT, and/or OCD for an age-corrected morbid risk of 33 ± 4%. It appears that perinatal difficulties and severity of tic symptoms are inversely related to the recurrence risk among first-degree relatives of GTS probands.

The author reanalyzed data from the ECA study. He divided respondents into those who met criteria for major depression and exhibited appetite and sleep disturbances and fatigue (somatic depression) and those who met depression criteria but did not exhibit all of these somatic criteria (pure depression). The reanalysis revealed that the prevalence of somatic depression but not pure depression was much higher among women than men. Somatic depression was associated with high rates of pain; among women, it was associated with high rates of anxiety disorders and chronic dysphoria. It is concluded that the gender difference in depression may result from a difference in a specific type of depression-anxious somatic depression.

When the (irrelevant) word is semantically related to the color (e.g., the word green, presented in red) response time is slower than if the word is neutral or unrelated. One question that has been posed concerns whether semantics plays a role only when the task requires an explicit verbal response, or whether it also plays a role when the response is manual. D. Sharma and F. P. McKenna (see record [rid]1998-12878-014[/rid]) have reported that semantics plays a role only when the response is vocal.

It is noted that an editorial change was made in the description of the PDDNOS subthreshold condition during the final phase of production that had an unintended effect on the definition of PDDNOS. The authors suggest that this change has led to serious concern that the PDDNOS concept was unacceptably broadened as a result of what was intended as a minor editorial change. To assess the impact of this change, the authors performed a series of reanalyses of the DSM-IV autism/PDD field trial data (F. R. Volkmer et al, 1994). The results support the advisability of the wording of PDDNOS which will appear in DSM-IV as part of the forthcoming (May 2000) text revision. A possible new wording for the category is suggested.

Watkins et al (see record [rid]1999-05268-011[/rid]) that found that vagal control correlated with state anxiety, but not with depression severity, in depressed older psychiatric patients (aged 50–69 yrs). In response to the Watkins et al concern about the influence of outliers and gender bias in the original sample, the current authors report that they reanalyzed the data, omitting the 3 potential "outliers" and adjusting for gender, and that the results of these reanalyses support the initial finding that anxiety is related to baroreflex control. The current authors also discuss the reasons that the 4 articles mentioned by Carney et al as missing from the literature review were not cited in the original study.

Abstract = {Reviews the book "Let Them Eat Prozac: The Unhealthy Relationship Between the Pharmaceutical Industry and Depression" by David Healy. The book contains a preface and a final chapter that are basically editorials that make these points; the book consists largely of case discussions, reanalysis of data, and historical statements about the development and marketing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The problem is that it is difficult to read these with the belief that the author is presenting a dispassionate historical account or an objective look at clinical cases, the literature, or data analysis. It is very clear that Healy has an agenda, and he takes every opportunity to reinforce that agenda. He tends to make sweeping statements, with lots of "evidence" that may be a peer-reviewed journal article but also may turn out to be a quote from a colleague or a line from one of the many anti-Prozac books. He also tends to exaggerate many facts in his favor--for example, a characterization of the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting that is correct in some respects but quite inaccurate in others.

The reanalysis of the data also was done with and without studies in which variables were dichotomized and no significant differences were found. The current authors recognize that their results do not allow determination of which scales are valid and invalid; however, they suggest that both the Rorschach and the MMPI are valid, and the MMPI has the better validity of the two.

Ss pressed a key with the left or right thumb to decide whether numbers presented visually every 14 sec were larger or smaller than 5. On each trial, 7 functional MRI brain volumes sensitive to brain oxygen-level dependent contrast were acquired. The repetition time (TR) of 2 sec was sufficient to monitor blood flow during a total of 128 trials by each S. Highly significant left and right precentral activations were found in cortical areas involved in motor control. There was a 97.2% agreement between inferred motor response based on a lateralized motor preparation index and actual response. An average prediction rate of 90.6% was found when the analysis was redone using an independent block of 32 trials. Implications for future research that use measured cerebral activity to infer behavioral and mental activity on any given trial are discussed.

Abstract = {M. Arden and L. Dye (see record [rid]1998-10816-010[/rid]) commented that for the state of menstrual synchrony to reliably persist for a prolonged period, "mean cycle lengths of synchrony partners" should be "approximately equal and vary only minimally around the mean" (p. 323). They implied that this may not have been the case in our sample of Bedouin families (A. Weller & L. Weller, see record [rid]1997-06365-004[/rid]). A reanalysis of our data shows very low variability of family cycle lengths: Median differences were only 1.4 and 1.3 days. Therefore, Arden and Dye's model (which was based on large variability in cycle lengths) is not appropriate for the Bedouin sample that they criticize, and our reliability criterion of 2 out of 3 months appears to be appropriate. Thus, the Bedouin sample provides conclusive evidence for menstrual synchrony both by the traditional measure of close menstrual onset differences and by Arden and Dye's newly suggested criterion: similar cycle lengths among synchrony partners.

The most striking regional finding was a higher than expected percentage of weapon-carrying students in the South, compared with other areas.

Key errors made included (1) the failure to take range restriction into account, (2) failure to take criterion unreliability into account, and (3) reanalysis.

Abstract = {Argues that categorizing the physical and psychological complaints linked to the menstrual cycle is controversial. Some view such effort as a sociopolitical attempt to minimize, or encapsulate, women's complaints. Others investigate treatments that alleviate these complaints. The author discusses how a review process and subsequent database reanalysis led to the remaining of luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and with it, the recognition that this disorder was one of mood. Also, briefly noted is the controversy surrounding the inclusion of LLPDD and later PMDD in the appendix of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). The author hopes that the results of studies demonstrating the effectiveness of antidepressant medications will assist researchers in their search for the etiology underlying premenstrual complaints.

The authors purport to advance psychoanalytic theory and technique by taking a fresh perspective on two important aspects of analytic encounter: the interaction between the analyst and analysand (therapist and patient) and how interactions in this relationship affect transference and countertransference. This book also examines the analysis of meaning and how treatment can assist in the understanding and reconstruction of client beliefs. The authors present a reanalysis of Freud's theory and the goal of the book is to elucidate the "flaws" in his work. The reviewer believes that many readers will be intrigued by the criticisms of Freud and the blending of more recent research into analytic models. This book is recommended for both analytically oriented therapists and interested readers who want to learn more about analytic treatment.

Demo (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1983[Apr], Vol 44[4], 824-833). In regards to the article, in a reanalysis of Savin-Williams and Demo's data, Schilling found that within-subject and between-subject effects in analysis of variance were not differentiated and that consequently several findings were in error. Details of the reanalysis and the corrected findings are included in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]1983-32498-001[/rid].) Employing a new self-report technique (paging devices), this study assessed the self-feelings of 35 adolescents (mean age 13.3 yrs) in various naturalistic contexts. Regression analysis was used to assess the stability of self-feelings. Ss fell into 3 groups: stable, oscillating, and unpredictable (the largest). For the sample as a whole, self-feelings were not influenced by the immediate context, although specific settings, activities, and others present within the contexts elicited various levels of self-feelings. More crucial for predicting the self-feelings were such enduring characteristics as sex, social class, pubertal maturation, stability group, birth order, and number of siblings. The authors argue for a baseline conceptualization of adolescent self-conception from which fluctuations occur. (44 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The author discussed a follow-up report by M. M. Kogon et al that provided an examination of patients' death certificates and postrandomization courses of medical treatment (p. 600). In the description of Kogon et al's medical chart review, the words "reanalysis of data" were used, leading to the mistaken impression of an imbalance in prognosis between treatment and control groups at baseline. The correct term should have been "analysis of data". As described, these new data indicated that the control group tended to develop more bone and lung metastases after study entry. In addition, it is noted that trend differences in adrenalectomy surgery did not account for treatment-control differences in survival. These data are consistent with the original report's description of more rapid disease progression and death for the control group.

A reanalysis of original results reveals that there was in fact a demonstrable difference in improvement for the euthymia-depression group treated with a mood stabilizer plus an antidepressant, suggesting that prior mood state may influence treatment responsivity in depressed bipolar patients.

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by S. H. Kollins et al (Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 1997 [June], 4 [2], 208–220). Corrections to Figure 1 on page 209 and Equation 2 on page 210 are provided. (The abstract of the original article appeared as follows). The results of many human operant conditioning experiments appear to show that humans are less sensitive than are non-humans to operant consequences, which suggests species discontinuities in basic behavioral processes. A reanalysis of 311 data sets from 25 studies that employed variable-interval schedules of reinforcement designed to assess sensitivity to reinforcement corroborates the claim that human behavioral allocation among alternatives often deviates from predictions based on rates of experimentally programmed consequences. Close inspection of the studies in question, however, suggests that methodological issues contribute heavily to the differences noted so far between humans and nonhumans and that an explanation based upon species discontinuities is not tenable.

(The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record 82-35560). Examined the alternate-form and longitudinal reliability of 2 versions of the Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) on a sample of 2,059 bisexual and homosexual HIV-seronegative males recruited from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Ss were tested over 12 data collection periods that were 6 mo in length. Findings revealed no significant differences between forms upon initial or 1-yr longitudinal administration, supporting the equivalence of the 2 versions. However, significant practice effects were noted longitudinally, arguing for the need of appropriate retest normative data. Furthermore, as age, ethnicity, and education were found to significantly affect test performance, normative data should be interpreted according to these variables. Results also present information concerning the use and limitations of alternative forms of the AVLT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by E. A. Maylor (Psychology and Aging, 1993[Sep], Vol 8[3], 420–428). There is an error in the picture recognition data. This was one of the tasks administered in an earlier group testing session (see page 421). The number of false positives for an older S was incorrectly entered onto the data sheet as 31 instead of only 13. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]1994-01191-001[/rid].) Ss (aged 52–83 yrs) named 30 famous people 4 times over the course of an hour and responded to 2 targets (a beard and a pipe) by marking the trial number on the response sheet. Initial performance in the prospective memory task was related only to a measure of incidental learning. Subsequent forgetting (i.e., success followed by failure) occurred more often for older Ss than for younger Ss, but there was no difference between the age groups in recovery (i.e., failure followed by success). Forgetting was predicted by age, even after a composite measure of general ability was included in the regression. Recovery was related to general ability alone. Results both replicate and extend those from a reanalysis of a previous study (E. A. Maylor, 1990). They provide a striking contrast with the effect of age on retrospective memory.… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Third, we challenge Marsh's summary of single-sex school effects in standardized (β) regression coefficients, artifactually small in this instance, which we contrast with more conventional standardized effect-size estimates. We reiterate our findings supporting the effectiveness of single-sex schools, which sit within a growing body of evidence suggesting positive effects on academic outcomes that accrue to young women in these contexts.

Abstract = {Reply by the current author to the comments made by E. Fuller Torrey (see record [rid]2013-42836-028[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2013-42818-016[/rid]). It appears that Dr. Pasamanick and current author do have some common ground of agreement. Current authors' mentioning some possible etiological factors such as lowered summer intake of protein and loss of electrolytes in preparation suggests that author shares with Dr. Pasamanick the .. harmful effects hypothesis" regarding the seasonality of schizophrenic births. As present author stated, "Place of birth was not available," and they have recognized that this is a methodological limitation not only in the study under consideration but in the overwhelming preponderance of schizophrenic birth studies. Torrey is correct in saying that in a number of studies the peak months have been in the second quarter of the year. Torrey is also correct in implying that temperature may not be the most critical variable. However, research, employing information contained in an article by Torrey and associates, demonstrated that correlating temperature of month with number of schizophrenic births produces findings with appreciable similarity to those using schizophrenic/general population birth ratios. Nevertheless, it was decided that a reanalysis of the data for all schizophrenic births in Alberta, using a direct comparison of obtained schizophrenic births and expected schizophrenic births on the basis of general population births, could provide clarification.

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Kathi A. Borden et al. (see record [rid]2013-42818-024[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2013-42637-005[/rid]). The argument of Borden et al. rests on two objections-one theoretical, the other methodological. Their theoretical objection is that the measures in the original study are too heterogeneous . They say that only measures of activity should have been used. Their methodological objection is that discriminant function analysis does not work, and should not be used, if the variables being considered are highly intercorrelated: that is, if the variables form a homogeneous set. In their reanalysis Borden et al. use a homogeneous set of measures-those that they think reflect activity level. They then use stepwise discriminant analysis to analyze the resulting data but they pay no attention to the intercorrelation among the ten variables they choose and then report findings that accord with DSM-3. Borden et al. do not succeed in demonstrating that the earlier paper is methodologically flawed. Instead, they contradict themselves. The nature of this self-contradiction, and their failure to note it, is itself instructive. The misrepresentation begins when they purport to have reanalyzed the same data used in the earlier study. Borden et al. also misrepresent the fact that four of the five stepwise discriminant function analyses carried out in the original study were done as variable selection procedures. These four analyses sought to find the variables most highly intercorrelated with, and best representing, the others in the set. This procedure and others, like factor analysis, are often used when there are more variables available for an analysis than can be reliably estimated given the sample size (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

According to Hyltenstam’s reply to my reanalysis of his data on the L2 acquisition of negative placement in Swedish, I misrepresent Hyltenstam’s position and my account of the data is neither observationally nor explanatorily adequate. My description of the data apparently misrepresents Hyltenstam because it "does not do justice to.. . the variation that is found in the data," nor is it an adequate account inasmuch as it distinguishes "certain stages" that are "not representative of the data, "whereas on the other hand it “leaves out the initial preverbal phase." Hyltenstam mentions the precedence of the main clause over the subordinate clause structure. This is one of the principles that is also incorporated into my proposal. However, of relevance for the difference between Hyltenstam's and my description is the observation that in the initial stages of language development semantic cues take precedence over morphological markers, whereas morphological markers that are perceptually salient prevail over nonsalient morphological distinctions.

In Jordens’ discussion of my study, there are a number of points that need to be treated, and which 1 hope to treat in more detail in a forthcoming article. Many of these points are diffuse and there are several peculiarities; it is, for example, difficult to see the motivation behind the choice of my article to illustrate some very general points of methodology-on which we are in full agreement and which I believe one can argue that my study fulfills to a great extent. Jordens’ article also shows a somewhat fragile knowledge of the relevant areas of Swedish syntax.

Abstract = {The Hawthorne experiments performed fifty years ago concluded that variations in factor workers' productivity were to be accounted for in terms of human factors. Franke and Kaul (1978) retrieved the original data of these remarkable experiments and showed through application of stepwise multiple regression analysis that over 90% of the observed variance in worker output could be accounted for in terms of the measured variables of the First Relay Experiment, rather than human factors. The present effort reinterprets several of the coefficients reported by Franke and Kaul and suggests that their conclusions rest on a strong algebraic component of the analysis as well as on violated assumptions, confounded variables, index correlations, the meaning of measurement, and so forth. Reanalysis is here performed with SSA-1, an ordinal technique, leading to conclusions in support of those of the original researchers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Irving's 1972 socioeconomic and occupational status scale for New Zealand in an urban sample of 72 Pakeha and 22 Maori families. 2 specific criticisms of the scale are presented: (a) that using an occupational status scale to identify socioeconomic status (SES) assumes a degree of homogeneity within each occupation that may not exist and (b) that the use of only 3 education categories (primary, secondary, and tertiary) may not be valid. Each family was placed into 1 of the 6 SES statuses on the Elley and Irving scale and entered into a regression equation with 11 indices of family background (e.g., salary, culture, and house size). Income was the best predictor of SES (p < .01), followed by education however, income and SES correlated at .57, while education and SES yielded a correlation of only .20. The Elley and Irving scale was viewed as unsatisfactory because of the equal weighting given to income and education. A scale designed to discriminate levels of secondary education was developed, and a reanalysis of the data using this scale showed the improved validity of the Elley and Irving measure.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 studies based on a methodological criticism of J. E. Gordon and H. C. Haywood's (see record [rid]1969-08582-001[/rid]) research on stimulus enrichment procedures with cultural-familial and brain-damaged retarded persons. The criticism focused on the confound of etiological group and order of similarities task presentation. A repeated measures design was used in the present studies, as well as in a reanalysis of Gordon's data, to isolate these order effects. The following variables were analyzed with 48 institutionalized retardates: etiology (cultural-familial vs organic), age (late childhood vs young adult), condition (regular similarities task A vs enriched similarities task B), and order (AB vs BA). In the noninstitutional study (n = 36) the same variables were investigated with the exception of age. The findings of 3 analyses, including significant Order * Condition interactions, seriously question the results and conclusions of Gordon and Haywood.

Abstract = {Notes that studies of sweetness additivity reported during the past 50 yrs have suggested 2 potentially different ways by which the taste system adds together different sweet substances in a mixture in order to arrive at a higher level. Type I additivity is characterized by the summation of concentrations in a mixture. The taste system then processes the mixture as if it were a higher concentration of 1 of the 2 components. Type II additivity is characterized by the summation of subjective sweetness of the components. The 2 additivity types were modeled by the addition of simple power functions and by polynomial functions in logarithmic coordinates. The goodness of fit of each model was assessed in 4 experiments with army personnel (N = 96) by evaluation of the sweetness of mixtures of glucose with fructose, sodium cyclamate, sodium saccharin, and saccharin, as well as by reanalysis of previously reported data in the literature. Both models provided good predictability of sweetness but did not differ in their goodness of fit to the empirical results. (17 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied Pavlovian conditioning of the pupillary dilation response in 3 experiments with adult paralyzed cats (N = 13). Sensitization and differentiation control procedures were used to distinguish between generalized and associative patterns of pupillary responses. In Exp. I a tone CS was paired with a shock UCS for Ss trained with incrementing CS-UCS intervals of 2.5-16 sec. Exp. II consisted of the reanalysis of data from a previous study in which white noise or tone served as the CS and the other stimulus served as a differential stimulus (DS). In Exp. III a sensitization procedure preceded differential conditioning. Results show that response latency to peak dilation monotonically increased with increasing CS-UCS intervals. Furthermore, 1 response occurred at CS onset and a 2nd or sometimes alternate response occurred later in the CS-UCS interval. Only the late, inhibition of delay response distinguished between the CS and DS. Moreover, this delayed response did not occur during the sensitization procedure. The results agree with GSR conditioning studies which suggest that only responses which exhibit inhibition of delay arise from the associative pairing of the CS and UCS.

After transferring 30 patients from the schizophrenic to the affective psychotic group and transferring 24 from affective psychotic to schizophrenic, there were 140 schizophrenics and 152 affective psychotics.

Abstract = {Reports multivariate correlational analyses of the relation of treatment (5 beginning reading instruction systems) to achievement (10 Stanford tests) in the United States Office of Education Cooperative Reading Studies Second-Grade Phase data. Multiple partialing was used to control for sex, 10 project sites, and 8 readiness tests. Canonical correlations of treatment residuals with achievement residuals showed very slight treatment effects. It is observed that this multivariate reanalysis is particularly appropriate to the design philosophy of the studies. It is also noted that the lack of differential effectiveness of the treatments should not be allowed to mask the fact that all the instructional systems were effective. The intercorrelations among the achievement residuals from regressions on all predictors were factor analyzed. The single important factor that emerged, of the general type, was named general intellectual development. It is concluded that this factor provides the best criterion variable for further curriculum research and that it operationalizes the contribution that primary education makes to general intelligence. Growth increments in general intelligence are posited as the fundamental product of primary education. (French & Spanish summaries) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A substantial amount of mental retardation runs in family lines and cannot be attributed to the action of single gene pairs or to chromosomal aberrations. It was hypothesized that 1 of the causes of this kind of retardation might be an inherited tendency, on the part of females in the family lines, to produce an inadequate uterine environment and hence produce a high proportion of retarded offspring. If so, sisters and aunts (as compared with brothers and uncles) of retarded propositus cases would be expected to produce a higher proportion of retarded (as well as spontaneously aborted, stillborn, or neonatal casualty) offspring. This hypothesis is supported by reanalysis of H. Reed and S. Reed's data on 262 propositus cases and their families. Implications of this finding are discussed. (15 ref.)

Abstract = {Conducted 3 experiments using 40 male Sprague-Dawley albino and hooded rats as Ss. No strict correlations between meals and intermeal intervals were observed in free-feeding patterns. Pooling of raw data into deciles did increase correlations, but also reduced data variance systematically. Reanalysis of raw data in relative terms (i.e., ratios of meals and intermeal intervals) yielded reliable meal pattern correlations, and indicated that feeding patterns are controlled by endogenous circadian signals of body nutrient depletion-repletion rather than short-term consequences of recently ingested food. Chronic treatment with insulin (which prevents mobilization of stored nutrients) appeared to attenuate the repletion signal, and termination of treatment (which leads to increased breakdown of stored nutrients) to accentuate the signal. Accordingly, the pattern of feeding may reflect lipid and/or glycogen metabolism. (19 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

It is argued that Bernbach's claim that Type 2 d' does not increase with practice is false, as evidenced by separate analysis of pairs with different past histories. It is also argued that when pooled group data are used to construct Type 2 operating characteristics, as has been the practice, S selection tends to confound effects of response bias with those of discriminability. Data from the 2 experiments are analyzed using both the group Type 2 analysis and an alternative analysis that is free from S selection. Outcomes of both analyses show that the more often responses have been given correctly in the past, the more easily Ss discriminate them from errors.

Results were used in the construction of a new instrument, the Treatment Milieu Scales. The CTE instrument was shortened, new factors were developed, and predictive ability with respect to the therapeutic orientation of the treatment environment was measured by hospital effectiveness. The effectiveness measures included in-hospital indicators such as staff morale, quality of over-all care, psychiatric care, patient movement, and net release, as well as in-community measures including social adjustment and medical (mental status) adjustment. Significant findings were obtained for the patient movement measures, while several partial correlations were significant in all the other in-hospital measures except staff morale. Findings suggest the "humanistic" tradition of therapy is not necessarily the most appropriate when viewed from the perspective of in-community patient rehabilitation. (22 ref.)

Parsons, et al.'S use of age-corrected scaled scores to compensate for ca differences among ss was considered to seriously compromise findings since age-corrected scores, so used, cause the criteria of measurement to vary from s to S. Reanalysis of published data, with averaged standard scaled scores substituted, failed to confirm reported findings. A further analysis, based on 21 right-hemisphere-damaged and 15 left-hemisphere-damaged head-injured veterans selected on the basis of equivalent cas, similarly failed to confirm reported differences.

Abstract = {The distribution of participation in small task-oriented group discussions has been described as harmonic or exponential. With evaluations based on different measures of goodness of fit, the harmonic function was rejected, and the exponential function accepted in its place. Reanalysis of the evidence shows that the exponential function does not describe the data any better than the harmonic. Several attempts have been made to explain why an exponential relation should occur. Since no explanations have been offered for the harmonic, the existence of explanations for the exponential relation should play a crucial role in the choice of a description. Analysis of the proposed explanations of the exponential reveals them to be inadequate. (15 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews recent studies of mentally retarded children which have found substantially higher rates of color blindness than usual for the general population. In 2 of these studies, sex differences in color blindness, invariably found in intellectually normal children, do not appear. Reanalysis of data from 1 of the studies suggests the possibility that the high rates arise from the difficulty in comprehending the test and following the directions rather than from faulty color vision. However, even if the number of color blind retarded children is actually lower than these studies show, it is suggested that more research is needed to determine whether using color dependent instructional materials with color blind, mentally retarded children may be detrimental.

These techniques are applied to a number of personality and cognitive measures using published data.

Although data were often inadequate, the techniques provided new information on the gene action controlling the measures and on their evolution.

Abstract = {In a large twin series the monozygotic pair concordance rate for schizophrenia was found to be 3.3 times greater than the dizygotic rate. In contrast, the difference for psychoneurosis was only 1.3. Reanalysis of 18 earlier major twin studies revealed a similar difference in all but 1 instance. This consistent difference suggests the presence of a genetic factor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and its relative absence in psychoneurosis. However, the role of the suggested genetic factor appears to be a limited one: 85% of the affected monozygotic pairs in the sample were discordant for schizophrenia.

Abstract = {2 experiments, involving 7 conditions, explored the use of direct measures of visual persistence. In each, the S was asked to judge if an intermittent stimulus appeared perceptually continuous, or whether it completely faded before the next presentation occurred. Exp. I with 24 Ss, showed that visual persistence was set at approximately 250 msec. for a recycling presentation of a circle in a tachistoscope; in another task employing a moving opaque slit passing back and forth over a circle, persistence times averaged 50 msec. longer. Reducing luminance by 2 log units increased persistence only slightly, though removing the adapting field increased it by over 100 msec. Exp. II with 3 Ss, using the repeating circle, varied the duration of the stimulus, and compared monoptic with dichoptic presentations. Visual persistence was independent of stimulus duration over a range of 4-200 msec., where all durations were above recognition threshold for the stimulus. Persistence was unaffected whether the stimulus was repeatedly presented in the same eye or alternated between eyes, strongly suggesting that the storage is central. Finally, a reanalysis of Dodwell and Engel's paper on stereopsis suggested that their effects can be adequately explained by visual persistence of the asynchronous stereo pairs, rather than a more complex fusion model. All of these results strongly support the use of visual persistence as a direct measure of short-term visual storage. (21 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Discusses the relative "goodness of figure" of structures having some resemblance to the linear ordering. Completely connected structures made of asymmetric relations tend toward the linear ordering and produce strain to the extent that they depart from it. The M. G. Kendall and B. B. Smith coefficient of consistency is proposed as an index of departure from the linear ordering, and predicts ease of learning very well in an experiment in which 102 undergraduates learned social structures based on the relation "influences." The coefficient is modified to deal with incomplete structures and structures composed of both symmetric and asymmetric relations. Reanalysis of previously published data demonstrates that the modified coefficient powerfully predicts ease of learning of various such structures. (27 ref.)

Abstract = {Attempts to sort out the sources of some of the inconsistent findings in terms of a detailed examination of between-studies differences in task and S variables. It is concluded that acute good premorbid schizophrenics show small but consistent size underestimation. Acute poor premorbid schizophrenics show a small but reliable tendency toward size overestimation. Paranoid schizophrenics underestimate, while nonparanoids overestimate, stimulus size. Among all schizophrenic groups the effects of drug status and relative acuteness or chronicity are at present not well specified. More research on task variables such as memory and viewing time is clearly required. A reanalysis of some previous data indicates that schizophrenics did not differ from normals in perceptual accuracy. The question of attributing differences in size estimation to a sensory process is raised. The present theories of flexibility, scanning, and redundancy do not provide complete explanations of the data. With the relevant variables more precisely identified, progress toward a more complete theory may be made. (28 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Interpretation of such a space is facilitated by an a priori definitional system for the variables being studied. A reanalysis of the intercorrelation matrix in a previous study by D. J. Hoger by means of the Guttman-Lingoes SSA-I computer program shows how a certain definitional structure of the test variables is reflected in a 2-space. Contiguous regions in this space represent the task of the S rule-inferring, rule-applying, and school achievement and the language of presentation of the item: verbal, digital, and figural. The 6 orthogonal common factors extracted by Hoger's factor analysis can be represented as 6 points in a 2-space simultaneously with the tests. Results add further confirmation to the utility of the faceted definition of intelligence and the radex hypothesis for the structure of test interrelationships.

Abstract = {A reanalysis of previously reported and new data from the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness suggests that the relative importance of individual differences and of situations is a pseudoissue. The mean squares for situations are regularly much larger than the mean squares for individual differences, but a partitioning of the variance shows, for the anxiousness trait, that each of these main sources contributed only about 5% of the total variation (sum of the component variances), modes of response about 25%, and that nearly 1/3 of the variance comes from simple interactions. These proportions are highly stable across samples of Ss. Because a substantial portion of the total variance comes from interactions, the suggestion that personality description might be improved by emphasizing what kinds of responses individuals make with what intensity in various kinds of situations is confirmed.

Abstract = {The research reported here extends an earlier investigation (Bailey, 1977) on the deterrent effect of imprisonment versus the death penalty for murder. As a result of some questions that have been raised about the use of stepwise regression in the earlier study, and how the possible problems associated with this analysis technique may have biased the earlier findings for the sanction and sociodemographic control variables, I reexamined the data using ordinary least-squares regression procedures. As before, multiple models of the sanction-offense-rate relationship are considered in a cross-sectional analysis of the deterrence hypothesis for imprisonment and executions for states for 1950 and 1960. This reanalysis also provides no support for the deterrence hypothesis for the certainty of execution and the severity of imprisonment. In addition, only partial support is found for the deterrence argument for the certainty of imprisonment, with this factor being significantly related with homicide rates in 1950, but not in 1960. The reduced level of imprisonment for homicide in 1960 is examined as a possible explanation for these mixed findings for the certainty of imprisonment.

As expected from this view, in 2 experiments with 145 undergraduates and in reanalyses of correlational data from A. Paivio et al (1968), high AF words were judged to be more familiar and were easier to recall but harder to recognize than low AF words, even with meaningfulness, imagery, length in letters, and frequency excluded as factors. When used as foils in a recognition experiment, high AF words attracted more responses than low AF words. AF and meaningfulness correlated only moderately and had different patterns of correlations with other variables, suggesting that the number of associations leading to and from a word differ.

Abstract = {The effect of instructing Ss as to the nature of the relationship between the 2 lists of a part-to-whole transfer situation has been studied in a number of cases with conflicting results. Some studies have shown that instructions to the S produce positive transfer, while in others only slight effects from instructions may be noted. Detailed analysis of S output protocols in a part-to-whole experiment with 48 college students demonstrated that Ss who maintained their List 1 organization showed positive transfer to the whole list. Reanalysis of several studies in the literature supports the conclusion that Ss who maintain their organization will show positive transfer under these conditions. In Exp II, with 24 college students, it is demonstrated that Ss can be instructed to maintain their List 1 organization during List 2 and that such instruction enhances the amount of positive transfer obtained. Results are viewed as consistent with a hierarchical version of an organization theory for recall performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined several cognitive perceptual features of the response of males and females to the antidepressant clorgyline and to dextroamphetamine. Two cognitive–perceptual indices of responsivity were used: (1) the self-perception and differentiation of affective changes, as assessed by the correlation of independent affective subscales; and (2) self-perceptions of behavior change, as assessed by the correlation of self-reports with actual performance or physiological measures on a variety of tasks. Study 1 involved the reanalysis of existing data (S. Lipper et al; see record [rid]1981-26398-001[/rid]) on 8 men and 16 women (mean ages 42.8 and 40.0 yrs, respectively, with 38% of each group 50+ yrs) who had participated in a series of studies on MAO-inhibiting antidepressants. Study 2 involved 6 male and 6 female (mean ages 34.7 and 31.5 yrs, respectively, with no postmenopausal females, but 1 male over 50 yrs of age) obsessive compulsives (DSM-III). Amphetamine was administered orally in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. There was a significant negative correlation between changes in anxiety and changes in activation for males only on clorgyline. Inspection of the negative correlation in the males and the slight positive correlation in the females suggests a gender-linked difference, which tended toward significance. In contrast, the correlations for activation and depression and depression and anxiety were much more similar for males and females, respectively.

Abstract = {Conducted an extension of M. Kohn's (1977) work on social class and parental values through a search for value dimensions other than Kohn's self-direction/conformity and an investigation of 3 aspects of social structure: immigrant status, quality of neighborhood, and housing type. Data were collected from parents of 305 9–11 yr olds resident in Sydney, Australia. Kohn's parental values instrument was used, but results were analyzed with a multivariate linear model rather than the traditional way. Immigrant status, neighborhood quality, family income, child's sex, and street type all predicted particular parental value sets. Non-Anglo immigrants differed from other groups in their strong emphasis on school performance, sex-role performance, and sibling relations. Parents in higher quality neighborhoods put greater value on children's sociability than did those in higher risk neighborhoods. Self-control, school performance, and neatness/cleanliness were favored by middle-income families. Parents living in industrial/commercial streets devalued school performance, achievement striving, and curiosity. Parental occupation and education did not have significant predictive power over and above the contribution of these variables. Reanalysis of the data using Kohn's factor analytic procedure gave the traditional self-direction/conformity factor, but immigrant status, quality of neighborhood, and income continued to explain more variance than occupation or education.

Abstract = {In the last 20 yrs, the concept of content area reading has been a major topic in the research and professional literature. However, this notion was not an invention of the 1960's; research contributing to this area was conducted as long as 50 yrs ago. Another recent trend has been the emergence of ethnography as a research tool. This, too, has been used since the 1920's. One early study that incorporated an ethnographic design for content reading was undertaken by J. M. McCallister (1930). A review and reanalysis of that study is presented.

Abstract = {Discusses the chronological model for the course of phasic psychoses published by U. Supprian between 1975 and 1978. Supprian developed this model to be used for recording the beginnings and ends of cyclothymic phases. However, in order to calculate these critical time periods, the therapist must accept the rhythmicity of drive and mood. Four cases are presented, although it is noted that this postulate concerning the rhythmicity of drive and mood cannot be corroborated with evidence from these 4 cases. A reanalysis of data from one of Supprian's investigations (see record [rid]1979-03794-001[/rid]) also did not succeed in empirically confirming this assumption of rhythmicity. Errors in statistical evaluation cannot be ruled out. Because rhythmicity cannot be proven, Supprian's model for the course of phasic psychoses is not recommended.

Their data were reanalyzed by the present authors through an ecological factor and analysis that produced 5 factors: World of Peace, Equality, Pleasure, Self-Determination, and Freedom. Six of the countries were also covered by G. Hofstede in his (1983) extended study of work-related values among employees of a multinational corporation in 53 countries and regions. For the overlapping countries, a correlation analysis was done between the 5 factor scores of the Ng et al reanalysis and the 4 dimension scores of Hofstede (i.e., Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, Individualism, and Masculinity). This correlation analysis revealed that each of Hofstede's dimensions could be distinctly identified in the Ng et al data as well. Findings are an example of synergy between different cross-cultural studies. (8 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Discusses spatial ability in terms of psychometric factors and information-processing research. Reanalysis of psychometric studies suggests 2 spatial factors—spatial relations and spatial visualization ability. Apparent differences between these speed factors and power and cognitive complexity are verified by process analyses of individual differences in spatial relations and visualization ability. Information-processing studies suggest multiple sources of individual differences, such as process execution speed, quality and capacity of representation, process coordination, and strategies for problem solution. It is suggested that by combining process and analysis with existing psychometric procedures, instruments and testing situations could be developed that would provide extensive diagnostic information regarding an individual's cognitive assets and liabilities, although the instruments and testing situations may be no more predictive than their predecessors.

Abstract = {The K. Pawlik (1983) critique has stimulated a reanalysis of the intercorrelations reported in the classical work of E. A. Fleishman and W. E. Hempel (1954). It was shown that the factor analysis of reference tests, together with all stages of psychomotor practice, leads to an artificially inflated specific factor of the practice test. At later stages of practice, this factor is so strong that general aptitude factors have little importance for the practice test. A more suitable method of analysis shows that general aptitude factors explain a reasonable percentage of variance even at later stages of practice.

There were indications that the hypnosis was focusing attention on the symptom and heightening anxiety.

Discussion centers on the need to monitor the course of therapy and continually evaluate its efficacy. The enuresis was not completely eradicated, but the patient's level of general functioning was enhanced, and at the time of discontinuing therapy, a successful outcome was in sight.

Abstract = {Recurring assessment problems in personality research related to the cross-situational consistency and predictability of behavior are evaluated in light of modern construct-oriented measurement theory. A recent study of the domain of conscientiousness behaviors (Mischel & Peake, 1982) is used to illustrate the consequences of not applying well-established strategies for the development and validation of psychological measures. It is argued that a careful specification of the behavioral exemplars of a trait domain and their interrelations is an essential precondition for the construct validity of a measure and for evidence of behavioral consistency. A reanalysis of the observational data of Mischel and Peake revealed conceptually and empirically identifiable facets of the domain of conscientiousness and, when behaviors were properly aggregated, substantial evidence of their construct validity and cross-situational generality. This finding is contrary to interpretations of Mischel and Peake and occurred despite several definitional and measurement problems identified in their study. Conditions contributing to the prediction of behavior across situations are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

While factor analysis may not be fully adequate for investigation of this question, use of this technique with variables reflecting CA variation must involve elimination of the age effect to assess relations among the constructs measured. Reanalyses of studies by the 3rd and 2nd authors (1977) of 67 kindergartners and by the 3rd author (1974) of 143 bright, average, and retarded 5–7 yr olds yield conflicting results on the identity between psychometric and Piagetian intelligences.

Evidence is found of reciprocal influence of brothers' level of educational attainment, net of the common effects of family background and the effect of each brother's mental ability on his schooling. The unconstrained effect of older brother's schooling on younger brother's schooling is larger than the reciprocal effect, but a model of equal reciprocal effects fits almost as well.

Abstract = {The magnitude estimation of taste intensity has often produced exponents greater than 1, suggesting that the perceived intensity of some taste stimuli increases at a faster rate than does stimulus concentration (i.e., the psychophysical functions are positively accelerating). However, a reanalysis of published data reveals that when these magnitude scales are replotted in linear coordinates, instead of the conventional log–log form, there is often no evidence of positive acceleration and the numerical value of the exponent bears no reliable relationship to the shape of its psychophysical function. Reasons for this finding are discussed and the implications for taste research are noted. (35 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated whether product familiarity improves shoppers' ability to learn new product information. Data from a 1981 study by the authors were examined that indicated that greater familiarity increased learning during a new purchase decision. 55 graduate students in business administration viewed an automobile advertisement in which 8 imported cars were compared on 11 attributes. Ss were assigned to a judgment condition or a choice condition. After completion of their tasks, Ss completed a demographic and knowledge questionnaire; this was followed by an unexpected recall task. Reanalysis confirmed that the familiarity effect depends strongly on decision strategy. Familiarity facilitated learning when Ss rated each alternative, but when Ss were instructed to choose one alternative, an "inverted –U" relationship between familiarity and learning resulted. These new analyses showed that consumers familiar with the product category demonstrate stronger brand organization for the new information, also.

Ego development levels (self-protective, conformist, conscientious) for each personality disorder are provided. Personality disorders that cluster in the dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster of the DSM-III (histrionic, narcissistic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders) were found to have the majority of Ss who scored below the conformity level; almost half the Ss in this personality cluster scored below the conformity level. Analysis also showed that the psychiatric Ss had no individuals functioning at the highest levels of ego development. Individuals who had their personality diagnoses deferred, predominantly because of psychotic mental disorders, typically scored at or above the conformity level on the sentence completion test.

Abstract = {Reviews the situation-response studies that have provided much of the evidence for interactionism in personality psychology. The results of these studies, which have addressed areas such as group participation and anxiety, are tabulated and subjected to a reanalysis. Serious problems are noted with respect to the methodology and analyses of these studies, and detailed criticisms are offered on the more influential ones. It is argued that it is impossible to institute adequate tests of the trait, situationist, and interactionist positions by means of an ANOVA because several different outcomes are compatible with some or all of the positions. It is concluded that the variance component technique has produced more confusion than clarity and that many of the conclusions concerning interactionism are unwarranted.

Ability, self-efficacy, goals, and task strategies were related to task performance. Self-efficacy was more strongly related to past performance than to future performance but remained a significant predictor of future performance even when past performance was controlled. Self-efficacy ratings for moderate to difficult levels of performance were the best predictors of future performance; a reanalysis of 2 previous goal-setting studies by the first author confirms this finding.

Abstract = {Contends that experimental and statistical methods for examining time-sharing ability in dual-task performance are inadequate. Unsophisticated use of correlational and factor analytic procedures has resulted in errors in the following areas: (1) derivation of simple structure and time-sharing ability, (2) number of factors, (3) lack of single tasks as marker variables, (4) orthogonality, (5) Ss and variables, (6) scoring techniques, (7) low reliability, and (8) practice effects. Based on a reanalysis of available data (the nature of task selection, scoring methods, and control of practice and reliability issues) in 4 previous studies, a time-sharing ability is not rejected. However, it is suggested that simulation, incorporation of theory in planning models, and crucial tests of hypotheses be incorporated into future methods for assessing the time-sharing ability.

Research on the "Steinzor effect" is reviewed in relation to the effects of between-member distance and member centrality (visibility) within the group on participation in group discussions.

The effect of a drug may be reduced or exaggerated, and prior treatment with a drug may affect placebo conditions. Asymmetrical transfer may be more common than is realized.

Abstract = {In 3 experiments, 72 male Wistar rats were administered either exogenous insulin or glucose as the UCS paired with a distinctive stimulus complex. Following several such pairings, the administration of a saline (test) solution to the S in that environment produced, in both cases, a reduction in blood-glucose levels (hypoglycemia) as compared to control S who received saline injections throughout. Contrary to previous assumptions, it is suggested that direct changes in blood glucose levels immediately following the administration of either glucose or insulin should not be treated as the UCR. The response of the CNS to the glucose or insulin, and not the immediate effect of increases or decreases in blood glucose levels, must be considered. Reanalysis suggests that in the case of glucose conditioning, the CR produces hypoglycemia which is in the same direction as that of the UCR. In the case of insulin conditioning, the UCR has not been well identified and consequently the CR may be in the same or opposite direction to that of the UCR.

Abstract = {Discusses L. G. Rorer's (1965) claim that meaningless acquiescence to attitude and personality scale items does not generalize and hence cannot be a source of artifactual relationships. Rorer excepts ambiguous scales from his own generalizations without providing or suggesting any test to tell which scales are ambiguous to a problematical degree; thus his generalizations are of unknown applicability. A reanalysis of 7 studies by the author (1979–1983) in which balanced scales were scored for acquiescence only revealed many high correlations between such scores, contrary to the findings used by Rorer. Correlations between acquiescence scores derived from balanced attitude scales and balanced personality scales were, however, generally low. It is concluded that meaningless acquiescence may be evinced by respondents to any scale if they find its items ambiguous and that such acquiescence will generalize from scale to scale. Meaningless acquiescence could then create many spurious relationships between unbalanced scales. (41 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Data from 2 recent experiments by the present author (see PA, Vols 68:360 and 69:11929) were reanalyzed through hierarchical multiple regression of performance on both goal level and expectancy, measured as a subjective probability of success. Ss in each experiment (86 and 58 undergraduates, respectively) performed repeated trials of a creativity task under different assigned goals. The reanalyses suggest that both goal levels and expectancy made independent contributions to variance in performance. Potential strategies for increasing performance by raising both goal levels and expectancies simultaneously are briefly discussed. New ways of conceptualizing expectancy and valence in goal-setting research are presented. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Tested 2 explanations of leadership. The 1st explanation, termed the Average Leadership Style, holds that superiors relate uniformly to subordinates in a work group on a given dimension of leadership style and that subordinate's reports of a superior's style are homogeneous across a work group. The 2nd explanation, termed the Vertical Dyad Linkage, focuses on the individualized dyadic exchanges between a superior and each subordinate in a work group, and holds that leaders behave differently toward subordinates in the same work groups on a given dimension. A within- and between-groups analysis was performed on longitudinal data originally compiled by F. Dansereau et al (1975) based on interviews with 17 superiors and 60 subordinates employed in a university housing complex. The key scale employed in the original study—negotiating latitude—attempted to assess the degree to which superiors allowed subordinates to shape a subordinate's role on the job. This reanalysis raises question about the negotiating latitude scale because the results are more compatible with an inference of ambiguous data rather than with an Average Leadership Style or a Vertical Dyad Linkage approach to leadership. It is concluded that within- and between-groups analysis is not limited to further research but can also be used to re-examine assumptions made in previous research.

Abstract = {C. E. Werts et al (see record [rid]1981-11287-001[/rid]) analyzed the relationship between a direct and an indirect measure of writing ability. They assumed that the same true score underlies both measures and concluded that the test–retest reliability of the essay tests is biased due to correlated errors. Reanalysis of their data showed that the direct and indirect tests measure 2 different abilities that correlate only .89 with each other and that it is not necessary to include correlated measurement errors for the essay tests. It is argued that the assumption that different tests measure the same ability should always be tested. (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a series of papers on informant accuracy in social network data, H. R. Bernard, P. D. Killworth, and more recently, L. Sailer, have concluded that "what people say, despite their presumed good intentions, bears no useful resemblance to their behavior" (Bernard et al, 1982). The present authors reanalyze one of the data sets used by Bernard et al in arriving at their conclusions. The set included 34 persons involved in a graduate program in technology and their communication patterns with each other over 1 wk. Unlike Bernard et al, the present authors find that the observed behavior data corresponds closely to the recalled data. Using different methods of analysis, the verbal recall data can be used to predict structural aspects of the observed data. Two major findings emerge from the reanalysis: First, the more similarly two people judge the communication pattern of others, the more they interact with each other; and, second, the more two people share accurate knowledge of others, the more they interact with each other.

Abstract = {Reanalysis of data from a conjoint analysis study by the 2nd author and colleagues (1981) demonstrated that the prediction of first-choice preferences by the full-profile method of conjoint analysis can be improved significantly by imposing constraints on parameters based on a priori knowledge of the ordering of part worths for different levels of an attribute. Constrained estimation, however, had little effect on the predictive validity of the tradeoff method because the preference judgments within rows (or columns) of tradeoff tables had largely the same role as the constraints.

Abstract = {The studies by H. Giles and R. Y. Bourhis (1975–1977) of voice and racial categorization in Britain have been interpreted as indicating that, within a generation of settlement, West Indians converge on local British accent norms enough to become linguistically indistinguishable from native White speakers. However, reanalysis of the available data shows that the Black speakers are recognized as Black significantly more than White speakers are falsely categorized as Black, so that claims of complete linguistic assimilation are not supported. It is argued that due to Ss' expectations regarding the proportions of West Indians likely to be heard, the detectability of Black speakers was underestimated.

Abstract = {The approach tendency of young precocial birds has been found to be related to stimulus magnitude in an inverted U-shaped fashion. This paper discusses the coding and processing of stimulus information in 2 cases, namely, when the quantitative stimulus variable is (1) the size of a moving object and (2) flicker rate. It is shown that the optimal size of a moving object for eliciting approach can be derived from motion parameters that describe the growth in angular size of the projected retinal image as the object approaches the chick. A 2nd analysis provides support for the hypothesis that the chick's attraction to intermittent light in the vicinity of 4 flashes/sec can be related to the alpha rhythm of the chick's brain waves. The conclusions are based on reanalyses of the results from studies by A. H. Schulman et al (1970) and J. K. Kovach (1980). (28 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The rejection by psychologists of the trait explanation of leadership emergence can be attributed to the results of 2 major types of studies: attempts to identify leadership traits and the use of rotation designs. Numerous reviews of the literature consistently note the failure to isolate a specific leadership trait. Using a rotation design, D. C. Barnlund (see record [rid]1963-01124-001[/rid]), after varying both the task and member composition of groups and computing the correlation of leadership rank in one group with the average leadership ranks received in all other groups, reported that leadership emergence varied across group situations. Thus, his data suggested that leadership is not a stable characteristic. The present study, however, used D. A. Kenny's (1981) social relations model to reexamine Barnlund's conclusion. This reanalysis suggests that between 49% and 82% (representing lower- and upper-bound estimates) leadership variance can be attributed to some stable characteristic. It is speculated that this characteristic, rather than being a traditional personality trait, may actually involve the ability to perceive the needs and goals of a constituency and to adjust one's personal approach to group action accordingly.

Abstract = {The recognition of the lateralization of language to the left hemisphere in most adults was a triumph of 19th-century neurology, but because the clinical finding of frequent crossed aphasia in children suggested that language functions were bilateral during childhood, the notion arose that lateralization was a developmental process that occurred over the 1st decade of life. Recent neuroanatomical, EEG, and neuropsychological investigations have tended to support the contrary view that language is primarily lateralized to the left hemisphere from the 1st mo of postuterine life. Now the collection of more clinical data on acquired childhood aphasia and the reanalysis of earlier clinical studies indicate that the modern incidence of crossed aphasia in children is too low to support the hypothesis of a gradual lateralization of language over time and is more consistent with a theory of developmental invariance of language lateralization.

The statistical methods used herein are shown to have certain optimal properties for the analysis of effect size data, and therefore the results of analyses based on these methods are generally preferable.

Abstract = {Theory of achievement motivation has developed via a series of additive adjustments in which the constructs of the theory have been elaborated and the explanatory domain widened. Although theory has continued to expand, the strength of a basic achievement motivation nomological network has not been systematically assessed during the development process. The present study assessed whether 7 of the standard dependent variables (initial task choice, persistence, performance, valence of success, valence of failure, task difficulty estimates, and the Zeigarnik effect) form such a network. Three experiments with 315 undergraduates were conducted that measured motive to approach success, motive to avoid failure, resultant achievement motive, and need for achievement. Results show that all but the Zeigarnik effect belong in the network, while problems exist in predicting initial task choice. Reanalysis of the Zeigarnik effect data shows that a different task memory variable (summated recall of completed and incompleted tasks) may form part of the nomological network.

Abstract = {Contends that adolescent research can be productively conceptualized and integrated within a life-span (LS) developmental framework. Research on pubertal timing and adolescent stress is presented to illustrate the application and utility of the LS perspective. Reasons for an apparent dearth of LS-oriented investigations are discussed; relatively few studies actually examined the childhood precursors and/or adult derivatives associated with adolescent behavior. The necessity for long-term longitudinal designs is underscored as a major obstacle for LS-oriented investigations. Alternative strategies by which LS-oriented research can be implemented are considered. Such strategies include reanalyses of data in longitudinal archives, utilization of retrospective data, use of sequential data collection procedures, and analyses of interindividual differences assumed to reflect developmental differences. While a variety of strategies are available for LS-oriented research, it is concluded that LS developmental principles ultimately must be substantiated by longitudinal data.

Abstract = {The generalized matching law states that the logarithm of the ratio of responses emitted or time spent responding in concurrent VI schedules is a linear function of the logarithm of the ratio of reinforcements obtained. The slope of this relation, sensitivity to reinforcement, varies about 1.0 but has been shown to be different when obtained in different laboratories. The present paper analyzed the results from 18 experiments on concurrent VI schedule performance and showed that response-allocation sensitivity to reinforcement was significantly smaller when arithmetic, rather than exponential, progressions were used to produce VI schedules. There were no differences in time-allocation sensitivity between the 2 methods of constructing VI schedules. Since the 2 laboratories have consistently used different methods for constructing VI schedules, the differences in obtained sensitivities to reinforcement are explained. The reanalysis suggests that animals may be sensitive to differences in the distribution of reinforcements in time. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a previous study, K. P. O'Connor and J. C. Shaw (see record [rid]1979-20454-001[/rid]) investigated the relationship between field dependence/independence (taken as a measure of cognitive organization), handedness strength (taken as a measure of functional organization), and resting EEG coherence spectra in the alpha band (taken as a measure of cortical organization). All 3 variables were significantly interrelated in the right-handed as well as left-handed subsample. However, some inconsistencies in the original report suggested the need for reanalysis of the data. The present study reanalyzed O'Connor and Shaw's results. When a mean unsigned error was used as score for the rod-and-frame test, more field-independent Ss consistently showed lower EEG coherence spectra than more field-dependent Ss. Also, both right- and left-handed field-independent Ss tended to show a stronger degree of handedness in the direction of their lateral preference than field-dependent Ss, indicating that a more field-independent approach is associated with greater specialization irrespective of the direction of lateral preference.

Abstract = {P. R. Grant and J. G. Holmes (see record [rid]1982-03594-001[/rid]) investigated the effects of stereotypic beliefs about Chinese and Irishmen on judgments of individuals. They concluded that social stereotypes strongly influence judgments even when case information is available. This conclusion runs counter to the results of experiments by the 1st author et al (see PA, Vols 66:8048 and 68:3546), which demonstrate that the presence of case information significantly and substantially reduces effects of stereotypes on judgments of individuals. The present authors contend that this apparent difference in results is not real. It is established that the design of Grant and Holmes's study does not permit evaluation of the argument advanced by Locksley et al, thus precluding comparisons between the 2 sets of data. Moreover, reanalyses of the Grant and Holmes data demonstrate that their Ss relied more heavily on case information than on social category information to make target judgments and did not adjust the weight they assigned to case information as a function of social category information.

No results could be found that were not better interpretable in terms of characteristic perceptions of self and situation as it was the case for the already existing conception of the real effort as the result of a calculatory process. Nevertheless, the published test for measuring avoidance tendency seems to be useful for research.

Abstract = {During the past 15 yrs, readmissions increased substantially as a proportion of all admissions to state mental hospitals, and the absolute number of readmissions appeared to rise. These trends were interpreted widely, but incorrectly, as reflecting an accelerated rate of return to the hospitals by discharged patients. A reanalysis of the data indicates that most of the rise in the readmission percentage in New York State mental health facilities was due to a drop in 1st admissions, and the apparent increase in the number of readmissions was entirely accounted for by several statistical artifacts. There was no appreciable increase in the rate of patients' rehospitalization within given periods of time after their release. (2 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied the relationship between memory span, memory scanning rate, short- and long-term components of free recall, and word recognition from long-term memory. The 1st study with 36 male and 33 female undergraduates produced a partial replication of A. Chiang and R. C. Atkinson's (see record [rid]1977-11963-001[/rid]) report of a sex difference: For males, span and scanning rate were unrelated; for females they were positively correlated. The 2nd study showed that span and the primary memory component of free recall had a modest positive correlation for females but not for males, while span was unrelated to measures of secondary or long-term memory for females but was consistently positively related for males. In the 3rd study, recognition accuracy and span were uncorrelated for females, but positively correlated for males. Reanalysis of data from a large-scale study by B. J. Underwood et al (see record [rid]1980-22700-001[/rid]) showed evidence of similar sex differences. Sex differences involving the correlation of memory span with other cognitive test performances seem quite general and need to be taken account of in the analysis of individual differences in memory and cognitive processes.

In the present study, a reanalysis of A. D. deGroot's (1965) verbal protocols indicated that players of different calibers direct their attention toward different areas of the board. Grandmasters and masters consider squares that are affected by many pieces, while lesser players direct their attention toward squares on which the pieces are located. In a recall experiment with 3 masters, 3 class A players, and 3 class C players, chess positions were presented that had been randomly generated to differ only in the degree to which the pieces converge on the same squares. Masters showed superior recall for briefly presented positions only when the material affected a highly centralized area of the board.

None of these studies, however, tested each model in its entirety. The present study is based on the assumption that the rejection of the null hypothesis of chance is not rigorous enough. Reanalysis of 13 data sets of published studies, using a more rigorous method, revealed that although the random null hypothesis can in fact be rejected in 11 data sets, the hexagonal–circular model was supported by only 2 data sets and was rejected by 11 of them. The hierarchical model for the structure of vocational interests proposed by the present author (1979) was submitted to an identical test and was supported by 6 of 10 data sets, including 4 that rejected the hexagonal–circular model. The predictions of each of the models that tend to be disconfirmed by empirical data are identified. Implications for the structure of interests and occupational choice are discussed.

Yet sociologists, lawyers, judges, and others continued to discuss "rising crime" and to develop theories to explain why. The reasons for increases differed between schools (biological, psychological, mainstream sociological, and Marxist). But theorists such as E. Durkheim, E. Ferri (1893), J. G. Tarde (1886), F. Engels, and W. A. Bonger (1916) were united in insisting that crime was rising. The present author explores the contradictions between theory and evidence in these various writers.

Kaiser's (see record [rid]1980-00280-001[/rid]) conclusions concerning the relationships among sex guilt, gender, positive and negative affect, and preference for erotic stimuli. It is argued that neither the correlation nor the regression analyses directly tested the models of human behavior proposed by Griffitt and Kaiser. A causal modeling reanalysis of their data contradicts their conclusions but offers some support for their theory concerning responsivity to erotic stimuli. Sex guilt is found to have a direct influence on positive affect, negative affect, and preference for erotic stimuli, as well as an effect on preference for erotic stimuli through its impact on positive and negative affect. It is concluded that researchers must choose statistical models that are consistent with their hypothetical models of human behavior.

Abstract = {Argues that findings from E. Egido and W. E. Cooper's (see record [rid]1981-23240-001[/rid]) experiments on alveolar flapping do not account for all the facts. The present authors argue that (a) not all sentence-boundaries and deletion sites block flapping; and (b) flapping is blocked even when speakers must "look ahead" across such boundaries to move or delete a constituent. They also suggest that the blocking of flapping is caused by a final intonation contour preceeding the flapping site. A reanalysis of Egido and Cooper's 3 experiments is provided.

Abstract = {Presents an index of encephalization based on a reanalysis of the brain/body-weight relationship in mammals. The index is related to the volume of the whole brain as well as to the surface and volume of the cerebral cortex. A theory of corticalization is developed in which the surface of the cerebral cortex is analyzed into 2 components, determined by the size of the animal and associated with an increase in the information-processing capacity. An inquiry was made into the brain structure, which can serve as an estimator of body weight. (35 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the relationships between aircrew compliance with procedures and operator errors, using data generated by H. P. Ruffell Smith (1979). Reanalysis showed that the character of individual operators, the chemistry of crew composition, and complex aspects of the operational environment affected procedural compliance by crew members. Associations between enumerated operator errors and several objective indicators of crew coordination were investigated. The correspondence among high operator error counts and infrequent compliance with specific crew coordination requirements was most notable when co-pilots were accountable for control of flight parameters.

Stogdill (1974) to analyze the relative importance of leadership qualities of Mekranoti-Kayaopo and American leaders. Data on the following variables were analyzed: intelligence, knowledge, social insight (the ability to "sense" the opinions of others), originality, aggressiveness, ambition, popularity, age, height, attractiveness, wealth, family status, and geographical centrality. Intelligence, generosity, knowledge, and ambition were rated as the most important attributes of both male and female Mekranoti leaders. Knowledge, originality, aggressiveness, popularity, and geographical centrality were important characteristics of US leaders. Results are discussed in terms of differences between the 2 societies. It is suggested that the failure of the 2 groups to differ in the importance of social insight and family status requires reanalysis of the role of leaders in simpler societies.

Blacha et al presented judges with 15 defenses and asked them to rate each DMI response as a defense. Reanalysis suggests that the DMI can be used to yield a composite measure of reaction to frustration by linearly contrasting the defenses of turning-against-object and projection against those of principalization and reversal-of-affect. Factor-analytic and correlational data support the exclusion of turning-against-self from the composite measure. Studies of content validity are presented for the combination of the 4 defenses into 1 dimension.

Abstract = {The criterion-oriented validity of psychological tests can be improved through the use of statistical models that assume a nonlinear relationship between test and criterion and that include nonlinear moderator effects. The present study shows how such models can be formulated, how their parameters can be identified, and how they can be tested for significance. The predictive accuracy of such a model is expressed by its coefficient of differential validity, which must exceed the linear criterion-oriented validity if the use of such a complex model is to be justified. In a reanalysis of data relating performance on an intelligence test (Bildertest) to the criterion of marks in school (German) courses (N = 110), nonlinear relationships between test and criterion were found only when class participation was taken into account as a moderator variable. The applicability of the approach described here to questions of diagnosis and prediction is discussed; in particular, its potential contribution to the improvement of test fairness is pointed out.

Abstract = {Conducted a laboratory experiment and a reanalysis of data collected in a previous field study to examine the effects of cooperation and competition on liking for other group members who varied in competence. It was hypothesized that when other members of a cooperative group are relatively incompetent, they will tend to be disliked because they decrease the S's chances of success. In competitive groups, however, incompetent members should not be disliked because they do not reduce the probability of the S's success. In Study 1, 40 male undergraduates were assigned to 3-person groups, each consisting of an S, a competent confederate, and an incompetent confederate. Ss completed a learning task under competitive or cooperative conditions and conditions of success or failure. In Study 2, data from a study on 5th graders who participated in interdependent learning groups or traditional classes and were then surveyed for attitudes about their classmates were analyzed. Both the laboratory experiment and the field study supported the hypotheses. In addition, in the field study the race of the other group members did not affect these tendencies.

Whitney et al, 1970) of alcohol preference in the mouse revealed little consistency beyond a basic additive genetic component. A simplified triple-test cross in the rat investigated the genetic architecture of alcohol preference for a 10% (w/v) alcohol solution or water. An initial survey of 8 selected and inbred strains identified high- and low-scoring strains, the Maudsley Nonreactive (MNR) and Irish (ACI), respectively, which were crossed as tester lines to 6 strains (the Roman high- and low-avoidance, Tryon maze-bright and maze-dull, MNR, and ACI) to produce the required set of largely F₁ families. The additive-dominance model proved adequate for males, and directional dominance for low alcohol preference was found on all 3 measures: alcohol intake, alcohol preference ratio, and alcohol calorie contribution ratio. For females, the model was adequate only for alcohol preference ratio, which showed ambidirectional dominance. The relevance of such genetic architecture to an animal model of alcoholism and the evolution of alcohol drinking in the rat is discussed.

Landy et al (see record [rid]1981-00274-001[/rid]), which assumed that a general factor present in the intercorrelations of ratings of performance was generated by halo rating errors. A number of decision rules were used to generate an analytic procedure for extracting halo errors, correcting ratings, and interpreting factors present in the corrected correlations. A number of the decision rules, as well as the initial assumption, seem to be rules of thumb or to depend on implicit theories of ratings and not on empirical data. Reanalysis of the rating data to allow both general 2nd- and 1st-order factors to be expressed in terms of item loadings recovered the structure present in the correlation of the original ratings as well as the psychological meanings of the 1st-order factors. General factors in rating data resemble general factors in measures of human ability. It is argued that removing general factors as if they were halo rather than true score may eliminate more of the variance from rating data than is justifiable.

Abstract = {Examines the practice of statistically controlling for halo effects in performance ratings. It is argued that there are 2 major problems with the partial correlation approach to removing halo from ratings data. First, the correct use of the technique depends on the validity of specific causal assumptions regarding the rating process that have not received empirical evaluation to date. The 2nd problem concerns analytic procedures employed in previous tests of the partialing approach. Reanalysis of data reported by F. Landy et al (see record [rid]1981-00274-001[/rid]) indicates that previous conclusions regarding the effectiveness of partialing may have been artifacts of the way the data were analyzed. It is felt that criticisms of the partial correlation approach to halo reduction are sufficient to suggest suspension of its use in any nonresearch context until necessary additional research is performed.

Noller et al extracted and rotated 7 separate factors, thereby attaining moderate approximation of the final rotated solution to maximum simple structure. The reanalysis resulted in a 6-factor oblique solution derived from the intercorrelations of all 33 variables, as well as a 5-factor solution based on the intercorrelations of the 25 personality scales alone. Findings agree strongly with the conclusions of Noller et al that there are 5 major personality-type dimensions within the normal trait sphere but suggest a slightly different interpretation of these structural dimensions.

Abstract = {Reviews laboratory and field research to identify objective indices for discrimination between body responses to mental and physical effort. Laboratory data on catecholamines show that urinary noradrenaline/adrenaline ratio decrease in response to mental tasks and increase in response to physical tasks. Under industrial conditions, the predominating component of effort (mental or physical) evoke body response similar to that found during laboratory experiments. Reanalysis of previously published findings reveals the same pattern of body response. A review of data on salivary cortisol, which increases in response to both mental and physical tasks, suggests that salivary cortisol may be another possible index for assessment of effort. Its deviations from the circadian pattern of excretion may represent a potential criterion for assessment of the emotional component of mental effort.

Ss solved a sequence of 60 semantic analogies presented on a computer-controlled display. At errors, the response time increased and HR decreased; after errors, the response latencies increased and HR decreased. Results are explained by a psychophysiological model in which the septo-hippocampal system functions as a control system that coordinates the priority and selection of cognitive processes. Error detection suppresses strategies that otherwise prevent looping and iterative reanalyses of old material. The inhibition is also responsible for the cardiac slowing during the post-error period.

Abstract = {Suggests that although D. J. Bem and A. Allen's (see record [rid]1975-04252-001[/rid]) proposal to use individual differences in consistency as a moderator variable has merit, their particular approach to the problem is not satisfactory. An acceptable way of representing this type of moderator effect is through interaction terms in a sequential regression analysis that departs from the traditional moderator model. However, results with simulated data indicate that the demonstrable contribution to criterion variance made by these interactions may be modest. The present analyses, including a reanalysis of Bem and Allen's own data, highlight the importance of unmoderated, linear relationships. It is suggested that the search for important moderator effects in the field of personality, rather than being largely atheoretical, should be guided by generic ideas about systematic interactions between certain kinds of personality variables.

Abstract = {Data from R. J. Shavelson's (see record [rid]1972-27870-001[/rid]) study investigating the change in cognitive structure due to instruction in Newtonian mechanics were reanalyzed using the quadratic assignment (QA) approach. Application of the QA technique involved a nonparametric confirmatory procedure to evaluate whether a hypothesized structure is present in a proximity matrix representing cognitive structure. The proximity matrices in Shavelson's study were obtained from multiple-response word association tests at a pretest and at the end of each day of a 5-day instructional sequence. The Euclidean distance measure Shavelson used to evaluate change toward a representation of the instructional content, however, did not measure structural change in the proximity matrices for cognitive structure. The present reanalysis using the QA paradigm showed that cognitive structure after instruction was similar to content structure before instruction, and word association tests did not measure any subtle changes toward greater similarity to content structure. However, the QA results provide some evidence for Shavelson's contention that the experimental group's cognitive structure changes toward greater homogeneity later in instruction.

Abstract = {In Exp I with 24 female albino rats, olfactory cues from prior Ss in operant chambers were shown to be an effective stimulus that could be used by other Ss to direct lever selection in a typical operant drug discrimination (DD) paradigm. Such cues persisted for long periods of time (16 hrs), and were deposited after short (5 min) operant sessions. In extinction tests, interanimal olfactory cues exerted strong stimulus control over lever selection. Furthermore, such cues were not specific to individual Ss but were generalizable between Ss. Interanimal cues directing lever selection could be abolished by cleaning operant manipulanda with a 10% alcohol solution. Reanalysis of some DD data previously reported by the 2nd author (see record [rid]1978-02962-001[/rid]) indicates that this specific earlier study might have been confounded by interanimal cues. Exp II with 16 male albino rats compared the relative potency of nicotine and an olfactory cue to determine whether olfactory or drug cues are prepotent when both are available. It was found that the drug cue was antagonized by mecamylamine for all Ss except those who had a reliable olfactory cue from prior Ss to direct lever selection (Ss who possessed both an olfactory and a drug cue to direct lever selection responded in a way suggesting that the exteroceptive olfactory cue controlled behavior rather than the interoceptive drug cue). Findings indicate that interanimal olfactory cues could be of considerable methodological significance in DD studies. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Observed 83 mother–child pairs when the children were 9 and 18 mo old to replicate J. A. Martin's (1981) finding of a sex difference in the relationship between early mother responsiveness and subsequent assessment of children's agentic behavior. The sex difference was reassessed by considering 2 components of Martin's score (responsiveness to bidding and nonresponsiveness to nonbidding) separately. The major finding was replicated in this sample: Maternal responsiveness predicted willingness to explore in boys and unwillingness to explore in girls. Reanalysis of both the present and the earlier sample suggests that the major source of the sex-specific difference lies in the correlates of a mother's intrusiveness when her infant is not bidding for interaction. It is proposed that analyses of maternal responsiveness should be explicit about the specific child behaviors that are selected as possible elicitors of a mother response and the type of mother response that is coded as "responsiveness."

Abstract = {Discusses the significance of Freud's essay "Die endliche und die unendliche Analyse" ("Analysis terminable and interminable") (1937) from a historical perspective. It is argued that in this essay, Freud developed several themes of profound importance to psychoanalysis and, at the same time, reactivated some antiquated ideas (e.g., the concept of ego instinct). Freud's observations on the nature of termination and on incomplete, complete, periodic, and interminable analysis are reviewed; his recommendations for reanalysis and ongoing self-analysis of psychoanalysts are noted.

Abstract = {P. Van Duyne (1976) reports that Ss' performance on P. C. Wason's (1966, 1968) selection task is biased by their prior belief in the truth of the rule with which they are reasoning. Specifically, Ss are reported as reasoning more logically if they believe the rule to be "sometimes true" rather than "always true." Van Duyne's analysis rests, however, on an interpretation of the Ss' verbal justifications; a reanalysis of his data shows no effects on actual response frequencies. It was felt that a more powerful test might be obtained by use of rules explicitly thought to be true and false. Accordingly, 24 undergraduates were asked to generate statements that they thought to be always and usually true and always and usually false, and were subsequently presented with a selection task on each of the 4 types of statement. Falsity did have a significant effect on response frequencies, in the direction of better logical performance. It is suggested that this result is not caused by Ss' intentions to validate their beliefs (as Van Duyne proposes) but that Ss' prior experience leads to the logical answer having more associative cues on "false" sentences.

The objective is to illustrate what occurs when using cross-lagged analysis in a situation of rapid change. 90 management training participants responded to a questionnaire at 2 different times early in the life of the simulated organizations (The Organization Game) in an effort to assess causality between role conflict/role ambiguity and several outcome variables. Only 1 weak causal inference could be determined (alienation reduces role ambiguity), but a reanalysis revealed that the developmental situation was too dynamic for use of cross-lagged analysis. Factor-structure comparison of data from the 2 times, as well as comparisons of the mean levels of responses and performance measures, underscored the dynamic nature of the situation.

Abstract = {Performed a factor analysis on measures of primary or core symptoms of hyperkinesis in 94 boys aged 4–12 yrs seen at a child psychiatry clinic. The 3 resulting stable factors account for 64% of the variance, and each was defined mainly by variables from a particular group of information. Sources included psychiatrists, chart raters, teachers, and parents. Inspection and a reanalysis of other multivariate studies of minimal brain dysfunction/hyperkinesis (MBD/HK) indicate that source-related rather than symptom-related factors typically result. It is suggested that the situational specificity of behaviors in MBD/HK children may contribute to the relative unfruitfulness of studies.

Abstract = {M. E. Gordon et al. (see record [rid]1980-33572-001[/rid]) developed a Union Commitment scale and identified four underlying factors. L. Friedman and R. J. Harvey (see record [rid]1986-28952-001[/rid]), in a reanalysis of the Gordon et al. data, concluded that union commitment was best represented by two factors. Although several investigations have replicated the Gordon et al. factor structure, none of these have used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In the present study we used CFA to test the explanatory power of the two a priori factor structures. A sample of 465 blue-collar workers working for a large utility company in the midwestern United States participated in this investigation. The results suggest that, first, a modified version of Gordon et al.'s four-factor solution provides a better representation of the factor structure of union commitment. Second, the use of either the four-factor solution or commitment as a unidimensional construct may be justified, depending on the research focus. Finally, we found that unit weighting of the union commitment items was the most appropriate strategy for generating composites. The implication of these results and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Instrumental analysis of Ss' spontaneous speech showed that they had distinct distributions for voiced and voiceless stops at all 3 places of articulation and that there was little overlap between voiced and voiceless cognates. Comparison of words uttered in isolation with words uttered in a sentence context revealed that Ss had shorter VOT values in running speech. Reanalysis of data from younger Ss showed evidence of such modification according to context at age 1.9. Compared with adults, the 4-yr-olds had longer mean VOT values, there was a greater range of values, and there was less modification according to sentence context. Data are interpreted as further evidence for the position that in producing voiceless stops in terms of mean VOT values, children first overshoot adult values and then only gradually draw them back toward adult values.

Fitts's (see record [rid]1955-02059-001[/rid]) law (i.e., the degree of precision required in any movement is a function of the number of alternative movements that could have been made) and outlines reasoning that predicts that, for tasks of equivalent difficulty as calculated by Fitts's Index of Difficulty, smaller-tolerance tasks will, within limits, take longer to perform. Reanalysis of Fitts's data appears to confirm this view. The notion that the overall performance of the human motor system plus associated feedback mechanisms can be described by any simple formulation assuming constant weighting of factors over a variety of tasks, such as proposed by Fitts's law, seems to be misfounded. Recent research supports the doubts concerning fixed-parameter linear and nonlinear models of the human motor system. Some implications of these ideas are discussed.

Abstract = {Several theorists have suggested that deficits in visual discrimination play an etiological role in the development of reading deficits in children who are diagnosed as learning disabled. In support of this theory, a number of studies have shown that disabled readers make more errors on visual discrimination tasks than good readers. The present study investigated the role of sex differences in these findings. 36 8- and 9-yr-old good readers and learning-disabled children of both sexes responded to 40 matching items under untimed conditions. Males made more errors than females, but overall, reading-disabled children made no more errors than good readers. These findings, along with a reanalysis of previous studies, suggest that because reading disabilities are more common in males, evidence construed as supporting a visual discrimination hypothesis may have been an artifact of sex difference in studies in which sex was not controlled.

Abstract = {In 2-ply concurrent schedules of reinforcement, 4 operants are identified based on discriminative stimuli and/or consequences with which they are associated. The investigation of concurrent performances has focused mainly on those responses that are periodically followed by reinforcement, while changeover behavior has been relatively neglected. A reanalysis of the scarce data on manipulation of the consequences of changeovers found in the literature suggests that variables affecting changeover rate may change the sensitivity of response ratios to ratios of reinforcement, while not altering bias toward a given schedule.

Abstract = {Advancing age is one of the few factors suggested to predict increased risk of tardive dyskinesias (TDs). Pooling and reanalysis of available epidemiological data produced strong linear correlations between ages (<40 to 70 yrs) and both the prevalences and severity of TD, while neither increased significantly after the age of 70 yrs. There was also a strong inverse correlation between rates of spontaneous remission of TD and age (<30 to >80 yrs); TD in those younger than 60 yrs improved over 3 times as often as in older patients. These correlations are not readily explained by the duration of previous exposure to neuroleptic drugs and may reflect increased sensitivity of the aging brain to them. These observations support caution in the prolonged use of neuroleptics in patients older than 50 yrs but encourage optimism for eventual spontaneous remission of TD in young adults.

Abstract = {Examined restraint theory's assumptions that restraint is a more fundamental variable than weight, that counterregulatory behavior typifies the obese, and that cognitive factors play a role in counterregulation. Findings of the present experiment with 55 college-age females were examined, along with reanalyses of data from 2 additional studies of restraint (J. A. Hibscher and C. P. Herman, see PA, Vol 58:9772; J. Spencer and W. Fremouw, see PA, Vol 62:6073). Data indicate that restraint was a powerful predictor of consummatory patterns. However, there was no support for the assumptions that counterregulatory behavior is prevalent among the obese and that the confound between weight and restraint can completely account for obese–normal differences in behavior. The theory's assumption that cognitive factors influence counterregulatory (and regulatory) behavior was consistent with the findings.

Abstract = {The final solution of U. G. Foa's (see record [rid]1965-11022-001[/rid]) facet structure of interpersonal behavior has come to an impasse because several authors have represented the facet structure in their own manner. One of the reasons for this unclarity of Foa's facet structure is the unusual definition of the 2nd facet: the object of behavior (the other or the self), which is not a behavioral but more a perceptual differentiation. Also, Foa's 8 behavioral types are misleading in their definition. A solution for these problems will be the result of a reanalysis of the facet structure of interpersonal behavior. A starting-point for this is the psychopathological theories. A new facet structure is proposed, and empirical support is given.

Four Ss continued to practice frequency discrimination for 20 hrs. Average performance at 500 and 1000 Hz approached that of trained listeners and variability in performance decreased.

The most important is from his reanalysis, which indicated that—because of a subadditive trend in the results—additive and multiplicative strategies fit our data in Experiment 1 about equally well. In reply, we performed a different analysis. Results corroborate subadditivity—and hence multiplicative information combination—in Experiment 1 but provide no evidence for it in Experiments 2 and 3. On the whole, then, the results still support additivity more strongly than any other combination rule and thus support our notion of minimodularity.

Abstract = {Examined the effects of individual members' interests in incentives offered by organizations, using data from an earlier study of associations by the present author (1988). Also examined is the proposal that differences in members' involvements are a function of multiple motivations and organizational incentives. Reanalysis of the data showed that members with higher interests in normative and social inducements were more likely to contribute time, money, and psychological commitment and to engage in internal participatory actions. Lobbying incentives were strongly related to external participation. Overtly utilitarian incentives such as material benefits, occupational rewards, and informational incentives were unrelated to involvement or actually attracted members unwilling to participate. The implications of these results for M. Olson's (1965) selective-incentive explanation of collective action are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present reanalysis of the intercorrelations of Wechsler subtests, achievement tests, and Piagetian tasks originally published by B. Stephens et al (see record [rid]1972-11633-001[/rid]) corrected errors in the original design and used models that allowed both differences and similarities to appear. Piagetian tasks contributed almost equally to the definition of the general factor in intelligence along with the Wechsler subtests and the achievement tests. The general factor, furthermore, made the single largest contribution to the variance of most of the measures of both sets. The smaller group factors consisted of an Academic Achievement factor and 3 Piagetian factors. Of the latter, the largest and most clearly identified was the factor called Operational Thought in the earlier analysis, but is here described as Conservation. It is concluded that the evidence for communality in function far outweighs the differences between intelligence tests and Piagetian tasks.

Abstract = {In their study of the detection of target movements during saccades, W. R. Whipple and H. Wallach (1978) reported a much lower threshold for displacement detection when target and eye motion are congruent than have other workers in this area. They also reported a substantial difference between displacement thresholds in congruent and orthogonal target movement conditions. The present authors describe technical features of the experimental apparatus used by Whipple and Wallach and techniques used in their eye-movement recordings that could partly account for these discrepancies. In addition, the differences between the congruent and orthogonal target movement conditions were found to nearly disappear when in reanalysis it was assumed that detection of target displacement is limited by the final position of the part of the target nearest the fovea. It is concluded that human Ss are relatively insensitive to target movements during saccades but the origin of this effect is still unknown. The authors' recent work is briefly described as it applies to the problem. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The transgression behavior (cheating) of 60 behavior-problem adolescents was observed in experimentally defined high-arousal and control situations. Congruent with predictions, more Ss exposed to a high-arousal situation transgressed. Scores on the Behavior Problem Checklist personality dimensions were compared for transgressors (34 Ss) and nontransgressors (26 Ss). As predicted, Conduct-Problem and Socialized-Delinquency subscale scores were significantly higher for transgressors than for nontransgressors. Personality-Problem subscale scores did not differ as predicted. 12 conduct-problem types and 12 personality-problem types were identified, and reanalysis of their data indicated that more conduct-problem types transgressed than did personality-problem types. The transgression behavior of personality-problem types varied across the high-arousal and control situations, whereas that of the conduct-problem types did not. The results are interpreted as further support for the dimensions of H. C. Quay and D. R. Peterson (1975) and for motivation-deficit theories of the behavior of conduct-problem types.

Three possible explanations for this ratio were considered based on differential onset, behavioral differences, and marital status. A reanalysis of survey data is presented to assess the validity of these explanations of the unusual ratio. It is concluded that the most reasonable explanation of the gender difference is the greater propensity for antisocial behavior on the part of sons, leading to increased parental needs for support and outside assistance.

Evidence that increased drinking among US-born women of Mexician heritage takes place in a context of culture change and acculturation is reviewed. Finally, changes in the direction of greater permissiveness and rationalization of alcohol use among later generation Mexican women are demonstrated.

Abstract = {A reanalysis of M. J. Blake's (see record [rid]1968-00451-001[/rid]) data indicated that the difference he observed in the temperature rhythm of introverts and extraverts was considerably more marked in neurotic than in stable Ss. That this difference may be related to the ease with which the rhythm adjusts to a phase change was demonstrated by (a) an examination of the persistence of the preflight rhythm immediately after an 8-hr eastward time-zone transition (phase advance) and (b) an assessment of the trends in temperature during a 12-hr night shift (phase delay). In both cases the temperature of "neurotic" extraverts exhibited the greatest degree of adjustment. It is further shown that the temperature of extraverts is more variable from day to day than that of introverts. Findings may reflect the existence of an underlying periodicity greater than 24 hrs in at least neurotic extraverts, and that this group may correspond with the "evening" type identified in other research.

Abstract = {Examines the hypothesis that Ss tend to allot figures to the negative poles of constructs approximately 38% of the time, which allows the negative judgments to be maximally striking in their proportion to the whole (the "golden section" is 62–38%). In a replication of a study by J. R. Eiser and C. J. Mower White (see record [rid]1974-09063-001[/rid]), 60 Canadian undergraduates (30 women and 30 men) judged 20 nonsense words (e.g., Johzan) as if these were the names of people on 20 bipolar constructs. 10 of these constructs contained positive poles which were evaluatively positive and negative poles which were evaluatively negative (e.g., kind–not kind) and the other 10 constructs had positive poles which were evaluatively negative and negative poles which were evaluatively positive (e.g., sad–not sad). The results of this experiment and a reanalysis of those of Eiser and Mower White clearly support the hypothesis. (14 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The nature of individual inconsistency in performance on trait measurements is an important topic in psychometrics because of its direct relevance to measurement reliability. Several studies have supported short-term inconsistency as a systematic source of variation among individuals by finding some evidence for generalizability and relationship to behavioral predictability. However, these findings are questionable, since these studies confounded change with short-term fluctuation in their response inconsistency measure. The present research separated these 2 sources of inconsistency in a reanalysis of the data from a study by R. F. Berdie (see PA, Vols 43:6137 and 44:17502) on short-term consistency. Little evidence for generalizability or a relationship to behavioral predictability was found. Results support the popular assumption that measurement error from short-term fluctuations is not due to systematic individual differences in response consistency, as well as a more limited definition of the individual inconsistency construct.

When the relevant data were reanalyzed by a correct method for the investigation of nominated interactions, the specificity hypothesis was supported. A new finding that emerged from the reanalysis is that, in 2 experiments (with thought-disordered schizophrenics, non-thought-disordered psychiatric patients, and normal controls) where level of "difficulty" of constructs was controlled, the specificity effect appeared much reduced or nonexistent when intensity scores were employed while remaining intact for consistency scores.

Abstract = {In 2 studies on how adolescent females deal with adolescent issues, it was observed that the 69 undergraduates (Study 1) and the 112 12th graders (Study 2) were not in the same identity status (J. E. Marcia's Identity Status Interview) for the areas of occupation, religion, and politics. It appeared that it was necessary for female adolescents to have explored alternative courses of action in the occupation area before they could consider possibilities in the religion area. The exploration of alternative beliefs and plans was necessary in the religion and occupation areas before alternatives could be explored in politics. Reanalyses of data from the 2 studies indicated that this scaling sequence was reliable. A suggestion of a horizontal décalage of successive applications of cognitive structures to these areas of concern is discussed within a Piagetian theoretical framework, as is the possibility that environmental variables determined areas of exploration. An attempted synthesis of these 2 viewpoints is presented. (11 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Cortical responses evoked by a vertical moving sinusoidal grating of fixed spatial frequency and variable contrast were recorded from the occiput in 3 males aged 21, 23, and 26 yrs. The potentials that resulted from binocular stimulation were, on the average, the linear vector sum of the responses obtained with monocular inspection of the pattern. A reanalysis of measurements of motion track enlargement (MTE) following monocular and binocular motion stimulation (G. Johansson, 1960) showed that the MTE for binocular vision could be accurately predicted by the same model. The outcome of the 2 studies may be closely related since pattern-reversal visually evoked potentials may be partly produced by movement- and direction-sensitive mechanisms within the brain.

Abstract = {G. V. Jones (see record [rid]1976-29208-001[/rid]) demonstrated that the memory trace resulting from the viewing of a picture corresponds to a fragment of that picture. The present paper shows that the fragmentation hypothesis also correctly represents the recall of memories derived from sentences. The paper is in 4 sections. First, an experiment is reported (in which 54 male university students were shown and asked to recall sets of 9 slides) that confirms that Jones's results cannot themselves be attributed to verbal recoding of the visual stimuli used there. Second, the reanalysis of 4 large experiments of J. R. Anderson and G. H. Bower (1973) investigating the cued recall of sentences shows that sentences, both imaged and nonimaged, also give rise to fragments in memory. Third, the fragmentation hypothesis is shown to be consistent with the results of several other experiments investigating the multiple cuing of sentences, even though the storage of configural information is not assumed. Fourth, the status of the fragmentation hypothesis as a general theory of memory is discussed in the light of a distinction drawn between structural and compositional representations of memory.

Rorer's (1965) exoneration of the F scale from acquiescent response style contamination is dependent on the finding that various acquiescence measures fail to intercorrelate.

It is found, in fact, even with scales that are not particularly ambiguous. It is concluded that some scales are not responded to meaningfully by some people, and if these people are not to be confounded with real high scorers, balancing against acquiescence is still needed.

Abstract = {Reviews the medicolegal inquiry into the physical and mental health of Marie Besnard, accused of the poisoning of 11 members of her family, and later acquitted. Psychiatric literature pertaining to poisoners is summarized and criticized for a concentration on hysterical women or those with a characterological disorder. It is asserted that there is no psychological portrait that is characteristic of this type of criminal. Following a reanalysis of the evidence gathered on the physical state and mental condition of the accused, the expert psychiatric testimony offered during the trial is faulted for too great a dependence on subjective judgment and too accusatory a tone. Criminal responsibility must be based on material and objective evidence, and while the present author (1984) has published an opinion that the accused was culpable, the use made of psychiatric testimony during the trial is judged unacceptable.

Abstract = {27 male sticklebacks with newly built nests were observed for 5 min after the introduction of various intruders into their territories. The intruders, which were confined in the bulb of a long-necked glass flask, were (a) a conspecific male in breeding condition, (b) a male ten-spined stickleback (Pygosteus pungitius) in breeding condition, and (c) a female smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris). Results were subjected to a principal components analysis, followed by varimax rotation, methods whose general usefulness in analyzing complex correlated responses are discussed. In all these tests, both when the Ss had an empty nest and when they had newly hatched young, the factors that emerged were recognizable in terms of the major systems in which the behavior of sticklebacks is usually discussed. Reanalysis of data from E. Cullen (1960) using principal components analysis confirmed her original conclusions and unearthed some undetected results.

Abstract = {Hypothesizes that cloze easiness (i.e., the percentage of Ss filling in the correct word in a cloze task) is a measure of information as defined by C. Shannon and W. Weaver (1949). A theory is developed that information is a function of 2 variables: (a) the number of lexical markers associated with the word and (b) the number of lexical markers supplied for the word through what U. Weinrich (1966) calls transfer features. The theory states that frequent words are low information words because they have few lexical markers. Rare words are high information words because they have many markers; however, the literature of automated indexing (e.g., I. Carrol and R. Roeloffs, 1969) shows that rare words that are repeated in a text are closely associated with the topic of the text. It follows that rare words that are repeated in a text are low information words by virtue of extraordinary transfer feature support. The theory is shown to be consistent with a reanalysis of J. Bormuth (1966) data resulting from administering cloze tests to 675 elementary school Ss over 20 passages at 4 levels of difficulty. The theory is examined in light of 3 current models of reading.

Rather, the available data suggest that the self-confrontation process involves the resolution of inconsistencies between behaviors and self-conceptions that are revealed during the treatment session. The authors interpret these findings within the framework of Rokeach's general theory of self-dissatisfaction and cognitive–behavioral change. Suggestions for future directions in self-confrontation research are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied the effectiveness of visually presented maternal stimuli for promoting adaptive behaviors. 40 36–54 mo old children in a standardized playroom were accompanied by either their mother; a silent, color, life-sized motion picture of her; a film of an unfamiliar woman; or a gray light. Ss with their mother, whether physically present or filmed, played longer than Ss with the filmed stranger or light. Thus, visual reception alone was sufficient to promote play duration. Other measures yielded similar but at times statistically nonsignificant patterns. Postexperimental interviews revealed that 40% of the Ss shown the filmed stranger mistook her for their mother. A reanalysis demonstrated that children misidentifying the stranger engaged in more play and locomotor activity than those correctly identifying her. This implied that any visual display perceived as the mother may suffice to promote adaptive responding in novel situations. (16 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Up through the middle of the 1st yr occasional signs of uneasiness are attributed to a wariness of the unfamiliar; such reactions are more likely to occur in highly "reactive" infants. By around age 9 mo, however, learned aversions which have their roots in prior disturbing experiences may become an important additional determinant that can supplement or override a baby's earlier proclivities.

Abstract = {49 mothers and their infants were observed when the children were aged 10 wks, 26 wks, and 54 wks. Previous findings of the present authors (see record [rid]1984-31111-001[/rid]) and of D. N. Stern (1974) have suggested that the partner's gaze state influences the probability of a mother or infant initiating and terminating gazes at the other. Data in these studies are reanalyzed to rectify deficiencies in the original methods of analysis. Findings from the reanalysis suggest that the pattern of dyadic gaze does deviate from that which might be expected by chance, but this deviation only appears to be a marginal influence on the organization of gaze behavior. Thus, it appears that the pattern of mother–infant gaze may largely be a result of the way each individual organizes his/her own behavior and not a result of interpersonal synchrony.

Five variables, relevant to the socialization and identification approaches, were assessed by teachers and/or parents using the Moral Judgment Interview when the 38 Ss were adolescents (aged 14 and 17 yrs): conscience strength, paternal identification, paternal involvement, maternal involvement, and maternal identification. Conscience strength in adolescence was correlated with adolescent moral judgment development and was a predictor of subsequent development during adulthood.

Abstract = {Corter (1987) reported a series of six experiments examining three measures of psychological proximity (similarity judgments, discrimination confusions, and identification errors) for effects of adding context stimuli similar to one of the target elements. The density hypothesis (Krumhansl, 1978) and the diagnosticity principle (Tversky, 1977) both predict that the added context elements should decrease the proximity of elements similar to the added context elements relative to elements dissimilar from the added context elements. This comment discusses various theoretical and practical considerations in assessing context effects on psychological proximity. A reanalysis of the data of Corter's first experiment shows a relatively large effect of the density manipulation consistent with predictions. That the remaining experiments do not show the predicted effect may be attributed to the small number of stimuli and limited control over the similarity structure of the stimulus sets. Difficulties are noted in interpreting density effects in identification data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Findings show that extrinsically represented categories showed (1) less agreement across Ss on membership judgments, (2) more graded membership in a membership judgment task, and (3) smaller differences between gradients of typicality and of membership judgments.

It is contended that Humphreys's criticisms are inappropriate since his findings are based on a measure of masculinity–femininity that is different from the previous approach and based on a sample that is somewhat different. Thus, he addresses issues that are inconsistent with the authors' focus. Finally, Humphreys's insistence on correlational analysis to the exclusion of extreme groups design is viewed as inappropriately limiting.

Abstract = {Used basic information theory statistics as quantitative performance measures of human information processing during a probabilistic inference task requiring 3 Ss to estimate the probabilities of a set of events based on sequential data observations. Reanalysis of previously published experimental data revealed that the Ss were able to gain relatively little information about the events from the observed data as compared to the amount of information that the Bayes theorem prescribed as being available. The average subjective uncertainty (conditional entropy) for the set of events was significantly higher than the Bayesian uncertainty, while the data redundancy was lower in the subjective than in the Bayesian case. Additional data observations had only minor impact on the subjective values of these 3 informational measures, especially when compared with the Bayes norm. The human information processing performance improved substantially when a probabilistic information processing system was used.

Abstract = {Human subjective thresholds and directional sensitivity were investigated as a function of vertical linear acceleration with head erect. A hyperbolic relation emerged between threshold latency and acceleration magnitude. This implies that detection was determined by attainment of a given velocity rather than the acceleration magnitude per se. Reanalysis of previous data from horizontal accelerations conducted with head erect and supine revealed similar hyperbolic relations with velocity constants of 22.6 ± 1.28 and 32.4 ± 1.96 cm/sec respectively. From these findings it is inferred that with head erect (i.e., normal attitude re gravity) the thresholds to predominantly utricular (horizontal acceleration) and saccular (vertical acceleration) stimulation were similar. With head "supine," the saccular threshold increased at the .001 level to 1.5 times its normal size. The results also confirm R. Malcolm and the 1st author's (1974) finding of difficulty in the subjective detection of the direction of vertical movement.

Abstract = {Goldstein (1987) studied the perception of pictures seen from the front and the side. Several distinctions arose from his results and analysis, but only one is central to the reanalysis presented here: The perceived orientation of objects within a picture with respect to the external world is a function of viewer position in front of the picture. For example, the eyes of a portrait subject appear to follow an observer who moves around a gallery. Viewed from many positions, such objects can be said to rotate, following a mobile viewer. Goldstein called this the differential rotation effect because those objects that point directly out of the picture (at 90°) rotate most; those pointing at other angles rotate in decreasing amounts. Goldstein offered no theoretical model and little in the way of explanation for this effect. This Observation offers a model based on the affine geometry and the analyses of La Gournerie (1859). This analysis transforms pictorial space (the space behind a photograph or representational picture) by shears, compressions, and dilations according to the viewpoint of the observer in relation to the composition point of the picture. These effects account for Goldstein's differential rotation effect quite well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The definition of inductive reasoning adopted by Colberg, Nester, and Trattner (1985) and the inductive test items constructed accordingly yield, in effect, purely deductive items. In contrast, Thurstone's (1938) original definition of induction as rule finding is found to be psychometrically more viable; it is unambiguous and empirically consequential. A multidimensional scaling reanalysis of Colberg's data using Smallest Space Analysis brings out the conceptual differentiation between items that require rule inference and those that require rule application only. This differentiation was absent in the original factor analysis. An appended methodological note contrasts multidimensional scaling (interpreted for regional partition patterns) with factor analysis and, making use of this study's results, illustrates differences between the two procedures.

Reanalysis of data from a previous study by the present author (see record [rid]1973-09012-001[/rid]), however, found that such disconfirmations can occur, with the extent of impression change closely mapping the degree that the prior impression about the other person departs from consensual reality. It is argued that the fundamental issue in this research is not the psychologist's conclusion about confirmation and disconfirmation; rather, the question is the change in the S's impression, its extent, and the conditions that promote such change during social interaction.

Abstract = {Free-operant behavior is more resistant to change when the rate of reinforcement is high than when it is low. The usual partial reinforcement extinction effect, demonstrating greater resistance to extinction after intermittent than after continuous reinforcement, seems to contradict this generalization. However, most free operant extinction data are reported as response totals, which confound the initial levels of responding and the rate at which responding decreases over the course of extinction. A reanalysis showed that after extended training, the slope of the extinction curve is shallower after continuous reinforcement than after intermittent reinforcement, suggesting greater rather than less resistance to change. The results, which hold for both independent-groups and within-subject comparisons, support the general finding that resistance to change of free-operant behavior is a positive function of the rate of reinforcement. This generalization does not, however, hold for discrete-trial performance. I discuss some consequences of these analyses for applications of behavioral research results.

Second, equally able students earned higher grades in lower ability schools. This frame-of-reference effect for grades was distinct from, but contributed to, the {bflpe} for academic self-concept. Third, a longitudinal analysis demonstrated that academic self-concept had a direct effect on subsequent school performance beyond the effects of academic ability and prior school performance. About one quarter of this effect could be explained in terms of the {bflpe}. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The author's previous analyses (1974, 1976) of teachers' comments in school records of schizophrenics showed progressive deviance in their childhood social behavior and sharp differences between the sexes. The present report presents a replication of the longitudinal study, using 11 female and 5 male schizophrenics and 32 controls, and a reanalysis of the combined samples. Median age at admission of new Ss was 23 yrs. The principal findings from the earlier study were confirmed: In the later school years, preschizophrenic girls were primarily introverted and preschizophrenic boys mainly disagreeable. In the new study, the preschizophrenic girls were also emotionally unstable, introverted, and passive from kindergarten through Grade 6, suggesting an earlier history of social disengagement than was previously apparent, and the preschizophrenic boys were emotionally unstable in Grades 7–22, confirming a nonsignificant trend in the original study. The boys were not behaviorally distinguishable from other boys in elementary grades, so the notion of progressive deviance appears more applicable in their case.

Abstract = {Four White Carneaux pigeons chose between FI schedules of different durations presented in the terminal links of concurrent-chains schedules. The pair of schedules was always in the ratio of 2:1, but the absolute duration of the FIs varied. In 1 set of conditions, the different terminal-link schedules were associated with different keylight stimuli (cued conditions). In a 2nd set, the different terminal-link schedules were associated with the same stimulus (uncued conditions). Results from the cued conditions replicated previous findings that preference for the shorter FI schedule increased with FI duration. Preferences in the uncued conditions were lower than in the corresponding cued conditions but also increased with FI length. Degree of control under the uncued conditions was correlated with the extent to which the schedule during the terminal link was discriminated immediately on entry into the terminal link. The pattern of results in both conditions is inconsistent with the notion that choice behavior matches relative immediacy of reinforcement. Reanalysis of S. H Chung and R. J. Herrnstein's (see record [rid]1967-05743-001[/rid]) evidence for matching showed that matching in fact did not occur, as the preferences of their Ss for the shorter of 2 delays also increased with the absolute size of the delays.

Abstract = {Three studies using 200 undergraduates examined the effect of contingent monetary reward on the occurrence of behavior presumably determined by intrinsic task motivation. A general hypothesis that contingent monetary rewards would reduce the frequency of such behaviors was derived from a postulate of cognitive evaluation theory. For all studies, intrinsic task motivation was defined as the amount of free time a S spent working on a task without receiving reward. Study 1 investigated the effects of reward contingency and magnitude on the behavioral measure of intrinsic motivation and on related attitudinal variables. Study 2 examined the effects of reward contingency and 2 individual different variables (self-esteem and perceived locus of control) on intrinsic motivation and attitudinal measures. Although Study 2 showed no significant results, Study 1 demonstrated support for the hypothesis with the behavioral measure of intrinsic motivation, but not with the attitudinal measures. Further examination of the behavioral measure of intrinsic motivation suggested that this variable was bimodally distributed in both Studies 1 and 2. A test for normality indicated that the distributions were significantly nonnormal and that parametric analyses of mean differences were inappropriate. Study 3 reported the results of nonparametric reanalyses of Studies 1 and 2 and of data previously published by E. L. Deci as supportive of the postulate under examination. Deci's data were also found to be generally bimodal. The nonparametric analyses were nonsignificant for all data sets. Theoretical implications are discussed.

For some purposes it supersedes ANU I, a previously described 16-point scale. The 2 scores correlated at .83. The new scale was calculated using a broad range of data applied to a prestige score criterion to estimate an equation used to predict status scores for all occupations. The new scale is currently being used in the analysis of the ANU 1973 survey of social mobility in Australia and in the reanalysis of data from the ANU 1965 survey. Preliminary results indicate that the scale will be comparable both across time in Australia and across space when comparisons with the "second generation" of mobility studies are undertaken.

Abstract = {Reviews current classifications of leadership styles and maintains that a more inclusive classification would measure leadership style on 2 separate dimensions—need for control and participation. With such a classification it is possible to relate leadership style directly to group structure by measuring the difference between the leader's expressed needs and the opportunity of satisfying these needs in the position he/she is assigned within the structure. Opportunities for satisfying these needs are measured by indices of potential influence and participation. Finally, a discrepancy index, d, is developed to enable measurement of the difference between the matrix of needs and the matrix of need opportunities. Through an analysis of 117 undergraduates' scores on a battery of tests (e.g., MACH IV, MACH V, and the FIRO Scales), the correlations between the expressed needs for control and participation and leadership style scores were examined. Reanalysis of 3 previous small-group studies by the author and his associates illustrate the relation between d values of leaders and members and job satisfaction and group productivity.

It was originally thought that a person's delinquent tendencies could be predicted on the basis of the relationship between his/her TA and IQ, but a careful review of the literature does not support this view. Reanalysis of previous studies shows that the Q score was specifically developed to identify delinquents and appears to do so very well. When Q scores of delinquent and normal groups are compared, the differences are consistent and highly significant. When the established cutoff points are used, Q score correctly identifies about 70% of delinquents sampled, as well as 70% of normals. Additional Q score findings within delinquent and nondelinquent groups are also discussed. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In most current accounts of character classification, emphasis is laid on the role of the positive set. Reanalysis of a 1970 experiment by the present author showed that in the constant set procedure, as well as the varied set procedure, when consecutive sets of digits are used, latency to negative probes depends on remoteness from the positive set boundary, except when the positive set consists of only 1 item. Two further experiments with 30 undergraduates showed that in both the constant- and varied-set procedures, latency to individual negative probes decreased with their frequency, except with positive sets of 1 item. These data indicate that negatives are not usually classified as such merely by default. Some alternative models to S. Sternberg's (1966, 1967, 1970) are discussed. It is proposed that when an S is able to (always with 1-item positive sets) he/she will perform a physical match. Otherwise, the probe will access its location in long-term memory, associated with which is appropriate response information. The ease of recovery of that information is emphasized as responsible for variations in latencies. (46 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Contends that although the clinical presentation and course of schizophrenia are highly variable, it is unclear whether this reflects heterogeneity at an etiological level. The genetic evidence is reviewed concerning traditional clinical subtypes as well as more novel categories derived from multivariate statistical methods and T. J. Crow's (1980) Type I/Type II classification. Recent data based on a twin series and reanalysis of older published family material suggest that attempts to divide up schizophrenia have resulted in splits between 2 or more categories of disorder that occupy different positions on the same continuum of liability. Thus, apparent heterogeneity is more likely to be due to quantitative difference in familial-genetic loading rather than qualitative differences. Similarly, it is concluded that the hypothesis that schizophrenia can be broadly divided into 2 groups, one genetic and the other nongenetic, has little to support it.

Abstract = {Compared simplex and nonsimplex models containing personality and perceived environmental variables as predictors of current alcohol and drug abuse in a reanalysis of a study by R. H. Potvin and C. Lee (1980). Background, personality, and substance use were assessed in 1,121 13–18 yr olds. Results indicate that the nonsimplex model represented drug use data better in the 13–24 and 17–28 yr olds. Religiousness and conformity-commitment were constraining influences on drug use. Parental support and approval of friends had small negative effects on drug use, whereas self-esteem and alienation were unrelated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Rousseau's (see record [rid]1979-09967-001[/rid]) data. An empirical double-ordered conceptual system, a radex structure, was obtained, reflecting the 2 facets of the definition: behavior modality (instrumental, affective, and cognitive) and life areas (work and nonwork). The facet approach suggests that the various aspects of the domain may be characterized by different patterns of relationships. Results show a segmented type of relationship in the cognitive region and spillover in the instrumental region, thus supporting the facet approach rather than conventional approaches.

Data from 48 White middle-class married couples show that most of the variance in communication accuracy was accounted for by sender and unique relationship effects; little variance in communication accuracy was accounted for by receiver effects. No evidence of complementarity/similarity and only weak support for reciprocity/compensation in the communication abilities of wife and husband was found. There was a negative correlation between wives' sending ability and husbands' marital complaints, a finding consistent with the previous report. Wives' abilities to decode their husbands' expressions were negatively correlated with the wives' marital complaints. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Bernard's (1972) hypothesis, wives' well-being did not contribute more to husbands' well-being than vice versa. Results show that male initiative shapes the trajectory of well-being. Thus, husbands were more able to control the social psychological evaluation of life in the marital context. The only finding that lends some support to the female disadvantage thesis concerns the duration of the marriage. Married couples in later life who lacked adequate income were the least likely to express well-being and were also more likely to experience problems during times of adaptation.

Reanalysis of the data was done through using a differentiated method of scoring the CPM, which was based on the factorially determined structure of the test. Factor analysis of all test scores indicated that primarily perceptual abilities are required for solution of the Piagetian tests, although abstract reasoning is involved in the solution of matrices and in conservation of substance (equivalence) tasks.

Abstract = {A review of literature on group risk taking with measures other than the hypothetical choice dilemmas reveals a confusing pattern of results. Some report risky shift, some cautious shift, and some no shift. The group polarization hypothesis (i.e., that discussion leads to an enhancement of any initial tendencies of group members toward one or the other pole of a given scale) which originated with research with choice dilemmas and was later applied to attitude studies, is here extended to other risk measures. A reanalysis of data gathered by H. Lamm and R. Ochsmann (1972), involving betting decisions, provides support for the group polarization hypothesis. The hypothesis is also shown to bring order to the otherwise conflicting findings of previous research. Finally, the existence of reliable shifts in the median group member responses as well as in the arithmetic mean indicates that majority rule dynamics cannot account for the observed polarization.

Abstract = {Data from Haan, Smith, and Block's (1968) study of the relation of moral reasoning to sitting-in during the Free Speech Movement protest at the University of California in 1964 was reanalyzed using the current moral judgment scoring system. The original authors had found a bimodal pattern. In their study, more than half of the subjects who reasoned at both the lowest and highest levels of moral development sat in compared with 11% of the subjects reasoning at the middle level. Results of the current reanalysis show a monotonic pattern. At each higher stage of moral reasoning represented in the sample, a greater proportion of subjects sat in (i.e., Stage 3, 10%, Stage 3/4, 31%, Stage 4, 44%, Stage 4/5, 73%). Although moral stage was the most theoretically important correlate of sitting in, it was not the largest. Political identification, deontic choice, and moral type were even more strongly related to sitting in than was moral stage. An effect of sex on moral stage was found but there was no sex effect on sitting in or on the Stage × Sitting-In interaction. The data are discussed in terms of a more general model of moral reasoning and moral action. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results show that the TPC model was superior to the SLT model in predicting reports of wanting to self-disclose and intention to self-disclose and that those reports predicted self-disclosure. The advantage of the TPC model was attributed to its inclusion of social and personal components.

This article examines a current, explicit, central theory accounting for the observed flexibility in motor performance: the generalized motor program with a multiplicative rate parameter. Reanalysis of data from a variety of motor skills reported in the literature and a detailed study of skilled typewriting show that a generalized motor program with a multiplicative rate parameter generally does not fit observed performance. Instead, the data support a composite model of motor control in which performance is determined by both central and peripheral mechanisms.

A tendency to use metaphorical rather than behavioral concepts is also regarded as unhelpful.

While judgment of the viability of such an approach must await the availability of data derived from longitudinal behavioral observation, an initial estimate of the approach is offered, based on a reanalysis of data reported by Piaget (1962).

A 10-item attitude scale and a 70-item mathematics test were administered to 21,768 male and 19,274 female students attending school in 12 countries. Results were compared in terms of effect sizes (standardized differences between male and female means) and ω–2 (the percentage of variance accounted for by gender). Sex differences in both attitude and achievement were smaller than is sometimes assumed, but, with few exceptions, they favored males. The differences, however, appear too small to explain females' underrepresentation in mathematics classes and professions. In many cases, the magnitude of the differences was clearly associated with psychosocial patterns found in the diverse cultures. These patterns are discussed and related to the teaching of mathematics in the classroom. (70 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Mentally ill residents were more likely to have behavior problems and to have much longer stays. Residents diagnosed as senile, with or without a physical disorder, more closely resembled the purely physically ill than the purely mentally ill patients.

Abstract = {Examined the relationship between the psychoanalytic concept of oral traits and the personality dimensions of Extraversion (E) and Neuroticism (N) by administering the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and the written form of the 19 oral scales designed by F. Goldman-Eisler (1951) to 254 Ss. Factor analysis indicated that 5 factors were necessary to account for the majority of the observed common variance. The extraction of 5 factors was contrary to the extraction of 2 factors in the Goldman-Eisler study. Path analysis, using multiple regression, was performed to find to what extent E and N influenced the 19 oral scales. It was found that 15 of the 19 scales were significantly causally influenced by E and N. Because there were discrepancies between the correlations in the present study and those reported by Goldman-Eisler and between the number of factors found, the original correlation matrix of the Goldman-Eisler study was subjected to reanalysis. Results demonstrate mathematical flaws in Goldman-Eisler's results, and it is suggested that her study cannot be accepted as support for the psychoanalytic concept of oral character or the etiology of an oral syndrome.

Results support the linear development hierarchy in left-handed Ss' acquisition of left–right identification skills. For right-handed Ss, the linear structure specified by Whitehouse was not supported. It is suggested that for right-handed Ss, for those pairs of traits found to have conditional relations, there are also transfer effects present.

Abstract = {Discusses the current status of the controversy about the relationship between individuals's attitudes and subsequent behavior. It is suggested that one step toward the resolution of the existing controversy is the construction of a formal theory, specifying and integrating variables other than attitude into the framework. To this end, a model (in propositional form) is advanced focusing on attitude, centrality, and salience as determinants of action. The model was partially tested through reanalysis of survey data dealing with attitudes and behaviors of 221 individuals with regard to halting air pollution. Data confirm that Ss for whom the attitude object was central exhibited a higher level of attitude-behavior consistency than Ss for whom the attitude object was of low centrality. It is argued that the use of the proposed model clarifies relationships which otherwise might incorrectly be interpreted and provides a practical logic for determining when a comparison may be reliable and when one should beware of probable measurement difficulties.

Gi ven relative neighborhood stability, some evidence indicates that the expected association may emerge among Blacks, depending on individual status characteristics such as income and residency tenure.

A summary of recent criticisms of the 16 PF as reflecting upon Catell's system is followed by a specific reanalysis of the foundations of that system. The question of whether Cattell's "personality sphere" factors were correctly identified in the 1st instance is raised. Instead of 12 factors, it is suggested that 6 clear-cut factors might have been extracted originally, factors which accord well with more recent work carried out independently from Cattell's laboratory. The implications of this argument are examined, accompanied by recommendations for more accurate delineation of personality factors in the future.

Abstract = {In 3 experiments, a Brown-Peterson task was followed by a final free recall (FFR) of all words. In Exp I, which was a reanalysis of data from a study by V. Modigliani and J. Seamon, the probability of FFR given a prior successful short-term recall, p (FFR/STR), increased with t, the length of the short-term interval. The unconditional probability of FFR, p (FFR), also increased with t. It is argued that the latter result could not be accounted for by item-selection processes alone. Instead, it is necessary to assume that an initial recall strengthened the recalled items and that this strengthening effect increased with t. In Exp II with 30 7th-8th graders, the use of a control group in which no initial recall was required completely verified the above proposition. Exp III, with 24 college students, showed that in this kind of task, there is no one-to-one correspondence between   p (STR) (the probability of initial recall) and either p (FFR/STR) or p (FFR). All data are interpreted in terms of a model which separated item-selection and strengthening effects of the initial recall. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The kinesthetic aftereffect (KAE) task, once a promising personality index, has been abandoned by many investigators because of poor retest reliability and intermittent validity. In challenging this current consensus, it is argued that (a) first-session KAE is valid; (b) poor retest reliability simply reflects later-session bias; and (c) hence, multisession studies should not be used to assess validity without taking this bias into account. Those recent studies which failed to support KAE validity were each multisession in design. If the present bias contention is correct, these studies should be ignored, and the claim of intermittent validity is thus rebutted. Reanalysis of the most recent major multisession, nonsupportive validity study indicates (a) Session 1 validity, (b) later-session bias, and (c) later-session validity when multisession scores are combined to avoid bias. Thus, KAE validly measures personality. (38 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated acquiescent response bias in the Wilson Conservatism scale via reanalysis of published data from 2 Japanese samples, 1 New Zealand sample, and 1 US sample. The correlation between liberal and conservation subscales was used as a criterion of construct validity, and it was hypothesized that the 2 Japanese samples would show less validity for the scale than would the 2 Western samples. It also was hypothesized that the New Zealand sample would show the highest validity. Although early studies of acquiescence treated it as a trait, evidence is reviewed indicating that nonmeaningful acquiescence is elicited as a response to some aspect of the test or test situation. Its presence can be detected with balanced scales, which yield a validity breakdown for the particular scale with that particular sample. Such balanced scales can be used to control for acquiescence and also to estimate validity of a particular test administration. Results show that 1 of the Japanese samples and the US sample showed satisfactory validity, whereas the other Japanese sample and the New Zealand sample showed little validity. Acquiescence response bias is virtually unpredictable, but measurements of its effects are vital for determining the validity of a test.

An apparent interaction in the between-class analysis was dismissed as unreliable. No interaction was found within classes. The importance of separating class, individual, and individual-within-class interaction effects is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conducted 3 studies to investigate the generality of the labeling bias effect (i.e., when Ss judge normal individuals as mentally ill as a function of diagnostically irrelevant stimuli). Exp I failed to find the effect with 60 undergraduates but demonstrated that these Ss can discriminate an audiotape recording of a psychiatric patient from a tape of a normal person. Exp II demonstrated labeling bias in 45 mental health service workers. Exp III produced labeling bias in 100 undergraduates by manipulating the "relevance" of the prestige figure. Data indicate that, contrary to previous interpretation, professional identity is not a necessary condition for producing labeling bias. Reanalysis of the data of previous research supported the hypothesis that labeling bias is extremely general and probably related to attractiveness of the communicator who gives the suggestion of mental illness, setting, ambiguity of desired response, and other similar variables in the social psychology literature.

Abstract = {Conducted a conceptual replication of the findings of J. W. Pennebaker et al (see record [rid]1982-27566-001[/rid]) that systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes are correlated with idiosyncratic patterns of symptoms within individuals and attempted to develop a standardized clinical procedure for assessing symptom–BP relationships. 11 normotensive undergraduate males participated in a series of 16 brief tasks. The 1st 8 tasks were mental stressors (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised [WAIS—R] subtests), whereas the 2nd 8 were physical stressors (e.g., breath-holding, running in place). Following each task or baseline, BP was measured and Ss rated the degree to which they were experiencing each of 9 symptoms (e.g., racing heart, sweaty hands). For each S, simple symptom–BP correlations were computed across the 16 measurement periods. High symptom–SBP correlations were obtained only for the physical task period. It is argued that the magnitudes of the correlations reported by Pennebaker et al were spuriously inflated by the inclusion of strenuous physical exercise, and a reanalysis of the data from that study supports this contention. It is concluded that the clinical value of assessing idiosyncratic symptom–BP relationships seems doubtful. (27 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews the study conducted by J. McV. Hunt and J.

Appropriate alternative measures are suggested in which the frequency of overestimations is taken as a proportion of opportunities to overestimate (i.e., wrong answers by the child). The higher this proportion, the stronger the mother's tendency to overestimate. The frequency of underestimations is taken as a proportion of opportunities to underestimate (i.e., right answers by the child). The higher this proportion, the stronger the mother's tendency to underestimate. Results that would have been obtained with these measures are approximated. According to this reanalysis, mothers' tendencies to both overestimate and underestimate have modest but significant negative correlations with children's intellectual ability. Mothers' tendency to make accurate estimations had a moderately strong positive correlation with children's intellectual ability.

Abstract = {Distributions of food reinforcement between 2 components of multiple VI schedules were varied over a number of conditions for 5 homing pigeons. Results indicate that sensitivity of reinforcement, measured by the exponent of the power function relating ratios of responses in the 2 components to ratios of reinforcers obtained in the components, did not differ between conditions with 15-sec or 60-sec component durations. The failure to demonstrate the short-component effect, in which sensitivity is high for short components, was consistent with reanalysis of previous data. With 60-sec components, sensitivity to reinforcement decreased systematically with time from component alternation and was higher in the 1st 15-sec subinterval of the 60-sec component than for the component whose total duration was 15 sec. It is concluded that varying component duration and sampling behavior at different times from component transition may not be equivalent ways of examining the effects of average temporal distance between components.

Abstract = {Notes that an extensive network of empirical relations has been identified in research on the psychological construct of self-monitoring. Nevertheless, in recent years some concerns have been expressed about the instrument used for the assessment of self-monitoring propensities, the Self-Monitoring Scale (SMS) developed by the 1st author (see record [rid]1975-03047-001[/rid]). Both the extent to which the SMS taps an interpretable and meaningful causal variable and the extent to which the self-monitoring construct provides an appropriate theoretical understanding of this causal variable have been questioned. An examination of reanalyses of studies of self-monitoring, analyses of the internal structure of the SMS, and further relevant data suggests that the measure does tap a meaningful and interpretable causal variable with pervasive influences on social behavior, a variable reflected as a general self-monitoring factor. The evaluation and furthering of the interpretation of this latent causal variable are discussed, criteria for evaluating alternative measures of self-monitoring are offered, and a new 18-item SMS is presented.

Abstract = {Reviews published data and presents new data relevant to the Spearman hypothesis, as presented by A. R. Jensen (1980), concerning the racial differences on cognitive tests of Black and White Americans. In the published data, correlation between the profiles of low and high socioeconomic status (SES) Whites became –.90 when sex, area of the country, and grade/age were controlled. This nearly mirror-image relationship suggests that the residual across-the-board difference between the 2 groups is primarily on the general factor in intelligence. In contrast, the same correlation between Blacks and the low SES Whites was only –.19. This indicated not only independence of the profiles but the presence of multiple causes of differences in addition to a possible contribution of the general factor. These interpretations were confirmed by obtaining correlations between general factor loadings and group differences through reanalysis of data from a study by the author and colleagues (see record [rid]1977-01254-001[/rid]). For the SES, dichotomy in Whites in this correlation was .86. For Blacks and the low SES Whites it was .17. The correlation between the 2 distributions of differences was .42. The Spearman hypothesis appears to apply primarily to differences in SES rather than race. (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a reanalysis of trend data on occupational mobility among men in the US, ways are defined in which movement among occupation groups across generations might be constant even when the occupational structure is changing. The analysis suggests that no change has taken place in occupational mobility (as specified by the authors' definition). Rather, it is indicated that the changing occupational distribution is the major factor affecting patterns of intergenerational occupational mobility. This implies the possibility of constructing occupational mobility tables for times when the age-specific occupation distribution is known, but, it is stated, no mobility survey has been carried out. Moreover, rather than treating the underlying process of mobility as a variable in comparative research and the variation in the distribution of occupations as a disturbance, it may be more fruitful, it is argued, to treat transformations of the occupational structure as problematic in comparative mobility research.

Abstract = {2 undergraduates and 2 university staff members rated the similarities of all pairs of the numbers zero through 9 in each of 24 conditions distinguished by the forms into which they were to be mentally transformed and then judged-including the visual forms of rows of dots and Arabic numerals-the auditory form of spoken English names and the amodal form of the abstract concepts of the integers themselves. Similarity ratings depended entirely upon the form in which the numbers were to be judged and not at all upon the form in which they were actually presented. Regardless of the form presented, multidimensional scaling solutions for each of the 24 conditions were readily interpretable in terms of structural properties of the form judged-curvature and closure for visual numerals; number of syllables, initial consonant, and vowel phoneme for auditory names; and numerical magnitude, odd-evenness, etc, for abstract concepts. Reanalyses of chronometric data are presented to illustrate how a fuller understanding of human cognitive processes may be attainable by using such structural models of internal representation in conjunction with studies of overt confusion and reaction time.

These reliable residual regularities (idiodynamic sets) were attributed to an internal self-regulating structure. However, specific word pairs also appeared to have an affinity that is common to all adults. These apparently contradictory findings were ordered to a unitary Brunswickian lens structure. The cone of "rays" to the left of the lens represent normative response probabilities, as quantified in normative tables for commonalities of word associations. The cone of "rays" to the right represent idiodynamic set probabilities. Word-association reactions of an individual stem from the interaction of these normative and idiodynamic distributions of probabilities.

All were referred for psychiatric outpatient care because of antisocial behavior. The method of sequential analysis was used. A significant positive effect documented the efficacy of dextroamphetamine as compared to placebo when both were added to an ongoing psychotherapeutic regimen. Tolerance, withdrawal, and euphoria were not associated with dextroamphetamine use in the experimental Ss. A reanalysis of the data demonstrated surprisingly close links between a history or presence of hyperactive traits and a clinical response to dextroamphetamine. Difficulties in employing dextroamphetamine in this age group are acknowledged and suggestions for further research are offered.

Abstract = {Discusses some of the difficulties in evaluating diagnostic reliability, presents a reanalysis of available data from the literature, and suggests possible actions that can be taken to increase the accuracy of psychiatric diagnosis. Methods of calculating the degree of interjudge agreement are described, and the validity of the resulting statistic, kappa, an intraclass correlation coefficient which contrasts the observed proportion of agreement with the proportion expected by chance, is discussed. The calculation of kappa, chance corrected agreement, is performed for 6 major studies of diagnostic reliability. Data suggest that there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high; reliability appears to be satisfactory only for 3 categories-mental deficiency, organic brain syndrome (not its subtypes), and alcoholism. 2 new procedures which may improve the reliability of diagnosis, structured interview schedules and specifications of all diagnostic criteria, are described.

Abstract = {Twins born between 1915 and 1960 in Norway and their spouses reported the years of education they and their parents had completed. Results reveal no decline in the marital correlation for educational attainment over that period. Comparable marital correlations were found for British (extracted from the 1971 census of Great Britain) and American (a reanalysis of US census data conducted by B. L. Warren, 1966) samples. A higher marital correlation was obtained for the parents of the Norwegian twins and their spouses, but a twin's recall of his/her parents' educational levels was shown, by model fitting, to be biased by his/her own educational level.

This procedure compared the rate of disruptive behavior exhibited by each of the Ss to the range and mean of disruptive behavior observed across 6 sections of the class in which placement was being considered. A significant amount of variability in the mean and range of disruptive responding was observed across the sections. Only 1 S appeared to be behaviorally ready for successful integration, and that S's behavior was determined to be within the normative range in 3 of the 6 sections considered.

Abstract = {Presents arguments and empirical evidence in support of the systematic training of children with low vision in the area of spatial concepts (SCs). It is shown that SCs are important for all persons, but especially for persons with low vision. SCs play a critical role in the use of many orientation and way-finding strategies that can greatly facilitate efficient travel of persons with low vision. Little is known about how well children with poor vision understand SCs. A previous study by the 1st and 3rd authors (1980) established test norms for visually impaired children on a standardized test of spatial concepts. A reanalysis of these data showed that children with low vision are comparable to blind children with regard to knowledge of SCs. Future research should focus on identifying factors that will enable professionals and parents to promote the acquisition of SC knowledge by children with low vision.

A belief in continuity of learning must suppose a proportionate improvement in skill within pages. Three experiments, with 22 undergraduates, and a reanalysis of 2 studies by the 1st author (1968, 1983) tested for continuity of learning by comparing performance within pages with performance between pages and by varying timing of text presentation and quantity of text presentation for the purpose. Results indicate that skill was acquired continuously as a function of practice but was expressed discontinuously. It is conjectured that the expression of skill requires perceptual segregation of tasks into task units to which skill is transferred, whereas acquisition of competence occurs as a strict function of practice.

Abstract = {Reexamined P. A. de Villiers and R. J.

Using only the positive-reinforcement studies cited that used 5 or more different reinforcement values, the present authors found that the high percentage of variance accommodated by this equation (94%) was predicated on instances of averaging rates of behavioral output before making a least-squares fit of the equation. In the reanalysis, which minimized rate averaging, only 78% of the data variance was accommodated. Although parameters can be added to yield acceptable levels of accommodation of data variance, the present authors argue that they correspond to no obvious psychological processes. It is concluded that the equation for simple action is an inadequate model for behavioral output. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Argues that the failure of many complex social interventions can be attributed to a lack of comprehension on the part of respondents with respect to the appropriate behavioral response. The means by which such "comprehension artifacts" can be detected and offset are detailed, using data obtained from a large-scale electric rate demonstration experiment in which 282 treatment group Ss' rates were tied to the time of day at which they used electricity. Standard analytic approaches suggested no treatment influence on Ss' usage behavior. However, reanalysis disclosed that the rate variation manipulation had a considerable impact on those who could be identified as having understood the complex features of the treatment. A methodology is described for discriminating knowledgeable from nonknowledgeable respondents, and the manner in which this categorization can be validated in secondary analysis settings is outlined. The use of the empirically derived categorization as a "blocking" variable is discussed, along with a consideration of alternative methodologies. In research involving complex social interventions, the suggested approach can provide information of considerably greater precision than that obtained through more traditional analytic techniques.

Abstract = {Questions the emphasis on the individual alcoholic as victim of the addiction and suggests that alcoholism literature has treated Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as an organization central to social policy on alcoholism. The organization has been the hero or villain of these critiques, and AA has been damaged and become the victim of its linkage with other organizations. Studies that have suggested how indigenous persons and groups are co-opted through their employment as paraprofessionals are cited in support of this contention. A reanalysis of the Rand Report (D. Armor et al, 1978) data related to the differential effectiveness of AA and professional treatment is presented. Results suggest that AA and its members were denied a major victory concerning the organization's role in obtaining abstinence as a treatment outcome. It is concluded that there is internal fragmentation in the various traditions identified in social thought related to alcoholism. It is contended that if self-help groups like AA are to continue to exist as autonomous entities, public policy must encompass the disease approach, one that allows alcoholics to assume responsibility for alcoholism without involvement in policy level decisions.

Abstract = {In a previous cross-cultural study by M. K.

In a reanalysis of data from 53 societies a combined measure of pressures toward achievement in childhood and diffusion of nurturance (based on the number of adults available to care for the children's dependency needs) correlated positively with frequency of drunkenness. In 38 societies, the association between frequency of drunkenness and diffusion of nurturance, pressures toward achievement in childhood and dependence in adulthood accounted for 46% of the total variance. Findings support the dependency-conflict hypothesis that frequency of drunkenness is related to societal customs that limit the indulgence of dependence in infancy, emphasize demands for achievement in childhood, and limit dependent behavior in adulthood.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments with 12 paid female undergraduates and 26 undergraduates receiving course credit, respectively. The Ss judged the subjective worth of bets defined entirely by verbal phrases such as "somewhat unlikely to win sandals." A theory of information integration predicts that the subjective values of probability and payoff should combine by multiplying. Procedures from functional measurement were applied to test the model and to scale the subjective values of verbal probabilities and payoffs. Data from both experiments support the model. The Ss also judged 2-part bets such as "highly probable to win watch" and "toss-up to win bicycle." The theory predicts that the worths of the 2 parts should combine by adding. In both experiments, however, the judged worth of 2-part bets was less than the sum of the worths of the parts. This subadditivity effect was also found in reanalyses of earlier studies on commodity bundles. This raises serious questions about the traditional additive utility approach to risky decision making.

Schlein (1971) of a preventative mental health program which stressed relationship improvement by maximizing empathy and self-disclosure, the efficacy of the program in improving communication and the general quality of the relationship between 48 college dating couples was demonstrated. The present reanalysis of Schlein's data shows that the experimental group, compared to the control group, also improved significantly on 2 key behavior rating scales by R. R. Carkhuff which are widely used to assess the efficacy of general helping relationship skills. As a result of less than 20 hrs of training, participants moved from providing levels of skills typical of college students to levels provided by typical counselors. The Empathy scale was highly correlated with 2 other Carkhuff scales, Respect and Immediacy. The trained Ss also showed a significantly greater increase in self-disclosure.

Abstract = {A review of the literature indicates that while a number of studies have investigated the effects of experimental manipulations on the competitive behavior of laboratory rodents, little systematization has been achieved in either experimental design or statistical analyses. A review of the analyses used in a number of competitive studies leads to the conclusion that between-group competitive experiments should be analyzed with one-sample statistics. It is suggested that if the one-sample chi square is used, the expected frequency should be calculated from the number of Ss in the experimental group. Reanalysis of some competitive experiments is recommended. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes the development of a 2-fold actuarial system to assist US Navy psychiatrists and administrators in determining which variables are predictive of posthospital adjustment. Biographical, clinical, hospital discharge, and follow-up data were examined for 2,824 Navy enlisted men admitted to psychiatric services. Analysis revealed that psychiatrists' recommendations regarding return to duty accurately predicted posthospital adjustment in 63% of the cases. However, in 13% of these cases, administrative decisions to return the patient to duty were implemented despite psychiatric recommendations to the contrary. Results of a regression analysis performed to determine the attributes distinguishing posthospital successes from failures revealed that service and medical histories were the best predictors of posthospital adjustment. 2 actuarial tables were then constructed to relate success rates to (a) clinical factors of years in service, diagnosis, and days in the hospital; and (b) administrative review factors of pay grade, disciplinary history, and wife's attitude toward the service. Reanalysis of data using these tables increased the success prediction rate from 63% to 74%, thus justifying the use of this system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Suggests that attempts to develop physical theories of psi are inadequate. Precognition is the most difficult type of psi to explain and appears to require a comprehensive reanalysis of its characteristics. A form of "psi physics" is needed to explore psi interaction, and "psi biology" is needed for the comparative study of psi in different species, focusing on the larger question of evolution. It is concluded that parapsychical issues are vital to humanity, but until the problems of psi physics and biology are defined and solved, the question of human survival cannot be answered by science.

Results are discussed in terms of a reanalysis of possible factors governing outcomes of classical-instrumental transfer experiments and also are related to expectations based upon motivational theories of CR mediational effects.

Abstract = {Examines the 2 most widely accepted definitions of unfair test bias. A. Cleary in 1968 defined unfair test bias in terms of consistent under- or overprediction of actual performance levels of minority or majority groups. R. L. Thorndike's 1971 definition holds that a test is unfairly biased whenever the difference between the minority and majority groups is greater on the test than on actual performance. These 2 definitions, which superficially appear to be similar, are shown to be very different in their implications for minority selection. It is demonstrated that whenever test validity is less than perfect and mean majority criterion performance is higher than that of the minority group, Thorndike's definition leads to acceptance of a larger percentage of minority group members than does the Cleary definition. A review and reanalysis of published research on test bias suggests that most conventional test usages are unbiased by Cleary's definition but unfair by Thorndike's criteria. Advantages and disadvantages of both concepts of unfair test bias are discussed. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a previous study by the 3rd author et al (see record [rid]1982-32788-001[/rid]), prepubertal depressives were found not to exhibit a shortened REM period latency during active illness when compared with pathological and normal control groups. The present investigation was a reanalysis of REM attempts during the early part of the sleep period of 2 consecutive nights to test the hypothesis that the normal REM period latency during active illness among pubertal depressives in the previous study was due to a nonselective inhibition of REM sleep by slow-wave sleep (SWS). Participants in the 2 studies were 39 Ss with major depression, 19 recovered depressives, 14 Ss with nondepressed emotional disorders, 19 neurotics, and 9 normal Ss (all aged 6–12 yrs). Polysomnographic signs normally associated with REM sleep were observed prior to the 1st REM period; it was thought that these signs might be indicative of minor escapes of REM sleep activity from the inhibitory influence of SWS. Differences among the experimental group in the occurrence (timing and amount per minute) of these signs were hypothesized to support the idea of an inhibitory effect of SWS on REM and thus offer an explanation of the dissociation between the depressive disorder among prepubertal children and a shortened REM period latency. These hypotheses, however, were not supported by the present results, indicating that the dissociation between a shortened REM period latency and depressive disorder among prepubertal children is not due to inhibitory mechanisms of SWS on REM sleep.

Abstract = {Existing research using infra-red corneal reflection techniques to assess infant pattern perception supports the existence of a developmental trend in pattern scanning from narrow to more extensive pattern scanning over the first few months of life; these changes have been attributed to the development of cortical functioning. The present authors discuss the possible sources of error in the use of these techniques with infants and critically evaluate the conclusions that have been drawn from existing studies. In addition to technical limitations in the early corneal reflection work, failure to take account of the infant's state of alertness may have caused younger infants to seem visually less capable than they really are. Based on this review of the existing literature and on a reanalysis of their own (see record [rid]1982-20800-001[/rid]) data on scanning in early infancy, the authors conclude that there are few data that unequivocally support the claimed developmental change in scanning extensiveness in early infancy.

Perino and the 1st author (see record [rid]1975-09962-001[/rid]) that moderate levels of lead exposure in 80 preschool urban Black children were related to cognitive impairment (the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities); and (2) the reexamination by the 1st author and colleagues (1981) of 63 of these children 5 yrs later, which found no significant association between preschool lead level and outcome measures, including cognitive measures, reading tests, and teacher behavior ratings. The positive findings of the preschool study were not substantiated in reanalysis, and the school-age lead data required technical adjustment. Additional variables were generated, including change scores, combinations, and interactions. Of 66 analyses, 2 tests of the lead effect were significant. The first depended on a deviant case; the second was an uninterpretable interaction. It is concluded that if these results are due to a lead effect, the effect is minimal. There was no evidence of an effect of moderate blood lead levels in the preschool period and any school-age outcome measure. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The 2 factors emerged with varying sets of descriptors and were even replicated in several data sets characterized by possible methodological problems (e.g., acquiescence response bias, inappropriate response formats) noted by earlier authors. The results thus attest to the stability and robustness of Positive and Negative Affect in self-report. Because this same 2-dimensional configuration has also been consistently identified in most other major lines of mood research, it is now firmly established as the basic structure of English-language affect at the general factor level.

The proportional information gain distance between pairs of categories formed the basis for examining the underlying structure of 19 types of deviant Rorschach responses. Smallest-space analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling were used to obtain spatial representations of this underlying structure. Results suggest that Rapaport's thought-disorder categories reflect at least 2 distinct dimensions of what Rapaport termed "distance from the blot." One dimension refers to assigning meaning on the basis of either objective characteristics of the stimulus or personal associations; the other refers to Ss' use of rigid and concrete or overly fluid and scattered attentional sets. These 2 dimensions are discussed in terms of rated theoretical conceptions of thought disorder. (47 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Unfortunately, a majority of them suffer from severe methodological shortcomings that make their interpretation problematic at best. These problems are discussed, and a reanalysis of the literature is presented. Findings strongly suggest that at least some knowledge about the 5 bases of power (reward, coercive/punishment, legitimate, expert, and referent) is methodologically suspect. Suggestions for improving future research in this domain include attention to the development of more adequate self-report measures, the development of scales to be used as behavioral rather than attributional referents, and concentration on individual- rather than group-level analysis.

It suggests that chronic psychometric problems in construct validation research can usually be attributed to underlying theoretical problems. Concrete examples of the limitations of cognitive-developmental theory in guiding research on egocentrism are provided and new theoretical directions are outlined. These alternative explanatory frameworks include, contextual theory developed by D. H. Feldman (1980), the cognitive-processing theory of M. Chapman (1981), and the living-systems theory of D. H. Ford (in press) and the present author (1984). (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Presents a framework for studying the influence of reporting quality on meta-analytic results in which 3 sources of reporting deficiency are identified: quality (adequacy) of publicizing, quality of macrolevel reporting, and quality of the review process in a different way. To assess the influence of reporting quality empirically, 25 reports were sampled from the psychotherapy meta-analysis reported by M. L. Smith et al (1980) and recorded by the present authors. Two sources of information pertinent to reporting quality were established: interrater reliabilities and confidence judgments. Reanalyses incorporating reliability corrections and confidence judgments suggested that deficient reporting injects considerable noise into meta-analytic data and can lead to spurious conclusions.

Abstract = {A previous study by the present authors (1983) showed that juvenile male cowbirds (Molothrus ater ater) that had never heard other male cowbirds sing developed distinctively different repertoires when housed with M. a. ater females from their own area vs M. a. obscurus females from a distant population. Because female cowbirds do not sing, the differences in the males' songs did not arise through vocal imitation. A reanalysis of that data, together with the results of new playback experiments, demonstrates that the songs of female-housed males were functionally as well as acoustically distinctive. The songs of 8 groups of males that differed by age of singer, acoustic experience, and identity of social companion were tested. The playback results demonstrate that nonsinging female cowbirds stimulated the male to modify song content and song potency. Findings indicate the critical role female cowbirds may assume in the proximate and ultimate regulation of vocal development. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Divorce rates were higher for EMS than non-EMS women in young marriages and tended to be higher for EMS men in young and old marriages. EMS Ss generally reported lower marital satisfaction than non-EMS Ss, except for women in young marriages and men in old marriages. Marital satisfaction declined the longer married, except for EMS husbands. Romanticism was lower for EMS Ss. (46 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Suggests that much of the variability in the outcome of recent studies of confidence–accuracy correlations in eyewitness-identification experiments may be accounted for by differences in the design of the research. Specifically, lineup experiments in which the to-be-identified person (target) was always present have tended to produce higher confidence–accuracy correlations than studies also providing blank or target-absent lineups replacing the target with a lookalike. A reanalysis of data reported by the present author and G. L. Wells (see record [rid]1981-32698-001[/rid]) and by the author and H. Wallbridge (1982) revealed that lineup foils (nontargets) were identified with significantly less confidence than targets or looklikes but that targets and looklikes were identified with equal confidence. Two additional experiments tested the hypothesis that confidence of identification is a function of the similarity of the identified person to the original target. Exp I, using 53 university employees and 14 targets to increase generalizability, demonstrated that the person in the lineup who most closely resembled the target was identified with the highest mean level of confidence. Exp II examined confidence in identification following a crime staged for 260 introductory psychology students. Results indicate that the similarity of foils to the target (established by independent ratings) was predictive of both the frequency and confidence of identification of faces.

Abstract = {A comparison of the original research on impression formation by Asch and the reanalysis recently offered by Wishner reveals that the 2 writers addressed themselves to different problems. While Asch offered behavioral evidence bearing on the process of impression formation, Wishner has concentrated his attention on the behavior of Ss acting on their impressions. Wishner sought to define in operational terms Asch's concept of a "central trait." Analysis of his proposed operational definition suggests that he has succeeded in predicting, not whether a trait will play a central role in the impression formation process, but whether its effect will be visible in the behavioral observations. The use of a "perceptual model," in which attention is given to this initial process and in which contextual interactions between stimulus elements are given their proper consideration, is likely to be necessary in the successful prediction of responses.

Abstract = {The upper 10% of approximately 45,000 children in grades 4 to 8 in 36 states, who were given the Kuhlmann-Anderson Test, was composed of 2,676 girls and 1,853 boys, a ratio of 146.3 girls to 100 boys. A number of other studies of the sex ratios among children scoring the lowest and highest on intelligence tests give evidence that boys rather than girls dominate the extremes of the distribution. Reanalysis of certain of these data and a comparison with his own findings led the author to conclude that "there is no longer any justification for stating that more superior boys than girls are to be expected." On the other hand, the apparent female superiority found in this study might be due, among other things, to differential rates of development, bias in sampling, or the influence of achievement on test results.

Abstract = {The conclusion by Hartshorne and May (1928) regarding the specificity of moral behavior has been reconsidered in light of reanalyses of their data using factor analysis and Guttman's (1955) simplex model. Other studies relevant to the issue of specificity versus generality of moral behavior were also considered. The evidence indicates there is some underlying generality in moral behavior although there is still much of the variance of the honesty tests due to specific test determinants. A model is proposed to account for the findings. This model involves 2 generalization gradients: a gradient involving just the stimulus elements in a particular situation, and a gradient pertaining to verbal mediation in which certain cognitive elements are abstracted from one situation and generalized to a different and perhaps entirely new setting. Attention was given to the organizing and heuristic value of the model. (47 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A reanalysis of Rohracher's original data shows that the periodic microvibration of the body surface recorded by him does not require the assumption that there exists any physiological event occurring at that frequency. A "resonance" theory concerning the origin of microvibrations is proposed and this suggests that the frequency is determined by the physical characteristics of the particular body-transducer system used for its recording. The microvibration amplitude is shown to be a sensitive psychophysiological measure of muscle tension and gross bodily activity. The implications of the theory with regard to the determination of tremor frequencies are discussed. (24 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A recent study (see 37: 1939), in which certain college "presses" were interpreted as influencing the student's motivation for advanced training, was re-examined. The method used for controlling the student's initial educational level of aspiration—the analysis of covariance—was thought to be inappropriate, primarily because of anomalies in the correlation between initial and final levels of aspiration. In addition, the estimate of initial level of aspiration, which had been obtained retrospectively from the Ss, was judged to be too undependable for use as a measure of initial level of aspiration. Reanalyses of some of the data failed to support the author's original conclusions about the "effects" of the press on student motivation.

(2) the 'unbending mother' whose rigid superego controls and lack of flexibility may be viewed as reflecting a form of neurotic strength of character. (3) the 'fearful, inadequate mother' whose excessive guilt and insecurity are handled by a flight into anonymity and conventionality, resulting in a near-total suppression of all self-expression."

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Beatrice Rasof (see record [rid]2013-41591-018[/rid]). Rasof argues for the advantages of a parallel processing of parents in a children’s outpatient clinic. However, a reanalysis of the data presented by Rasof leads to a different conclusion. During the two-month study period some of the parents agreed to participate in the intake groups and some did not. If these two groups are combined, the total group represents all applicants, and is comparable to the parents in the earlier three-month in-. take period. Comparing the data for the former group, with those for the latter, there are no statistically significant differences with regard to lack of response to the letter or phone call, to completion of the application, nor to being in therapy six months later. Since there are no differences between the two groups, it is difficult to attribute any advantages to the parallel processing intake procedure. At best, it appears that the self-selection procedure involved identifies those parents who are less likely to complete the application process and be in therapy six months later, indicating a possible need for additional support for those individuals. It is not clear that actual membership in the intake group serves any constructive purpose. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The author (1980; see also PA, Vol 67:6015) has shown that the relative impairment in response to faces and facial expressions demonstrated by right-brain-damaged Ss was reduced by using blurred stimuli. Data from these studies were reanalyzed in light of J. Sergent's (see record [rid]1983-24695-001[/rid]) suggestion that hemispheres differ in their sensitivity to the spatial frequency of the input and in light of formulations related to the specificity of mechanisms. Reanalysis of these data supported the hypothesis of differential hemispheric sensitivity to spatial frequency of inputs and showed that the processing of expressions partially depends on the processing of faces.

Abstract = {Share (1988) expressed concern that data from our recent study (Tarnowski, Prinz, & Nay, 1986) failed to provide support for the diagnostic validity of specific subgroups of children contained within the attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH) and learning disability (LD) diagnostic dimensions. The Tarnowski et al (1986) study was not intended as a diagnostic validation of syndromes; its purpose was to compare the attentional performance of diagnostic subgroups that have been inappropriately combined in past research. A reanalysis of the data using canonical discrimination analysis reinforced our original findings of a combinatorial effect of ADDH and LD but failed to provide multivariate discrimination of the pure ADDH and LD subgroups. Given these findings, Share's (1988) point is well taken. We strongly recommend that future research on attentional performance in ADDH and LD populations subdivide samples on each dimension in order to avoid masking potentially meaningful group differences. Additional research needs to be conducted clarifying similarities and differences in the attentional functioning of ADDH + LD, ADDH, and LD subgroups.

Abstract = {This article discusses the papers presented at a symposium in honor of Jerome Frank at Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, May 1984. These papers refract different facets of Frank's impact on research in psychotherapy. Frank's challenge to the use of a medical model of differential diagnosis and differential treatment came with a call for evidence that psychotherapy had any attributable effects. From a reanalysis of four sources of data, the first paper finds strong evidence that therapists contribute to the variance in effectiveness, some weak evidence that patients contribute, and, little evidence for method differences. The second paper challenges the very aforementioned data base, arguing the case for individual tailoring of outcome observations and for clinical synthesis in place of standard measures rigidly applied in group comparisons. The final paper places Frank's challenge in the social and economic context of third-party payments, cost containment, and accountability.

The results reported, therefore, must be regarded as inconclusive and subject to caution in interpretation. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]1969-01266-001[/rid]). Attempted to provide a further empirical base for understanding the developmental mechanisms underlying visual size constancy. 15 brain-damaged retardates, 25 familial retardates, and 20 normal adolescents were studied. Significant differences in veridicality of size estimation were found between all 3 groups: (1) brain-damaged retardates exhibited the greatest size constancy, (2) familial retardates exhibited less constancy than organics, but more constancy than normals; and (3) all groups showed "overconstancy." Results show that the "primitivity" associated with the perceptual functioning of organic Ss may not be as pervasive as the literature seems to suggest. Results are explained via an "overspecialization" hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Any theory which not only claims to fit the data better than existing laws but obtains a perfect fit every time should call forth a certain amount of skepticism in the mind of any critical reader. Nihm's (November 1976) polynomial law of sensation makes such claims and thus deserves severe scrutiny. Small differences in Pearson correlation coefficients may represent large deviations of the data from the model. For example, the integers from 1 to 9 correlate .955 with their logarithms, .999 with their square roots, and .975 with their squares. These correlations are well within the range of values obtained to measure the fit of the power function to data. Therefore, any discrepancies from a perfect correlation may represent serious problems for the polynomial law! Thanks to the kindness of Sue Doe Nihm, who forwarded all of the previously published psychophysical data, and Barbara Mellers, who carried out the reanalyses using an HP-21 calculator, I have taken a closer look at the fit of the polynomial function. Correlations that were reported as perfect actually ranged from .999997 to 1.000002. On the average, the correlation was 1.000-but not for any given data set. These findings contradict Nihm's results and may be extremely important! Hence, the polynomial law of sensation does not rule out other possible theories. Despite the elegance and simplicity of Nihm's law, sensation is not always a polynomial function of physical intensity, although the average correlation of the theory with the data is 1.000.

Abstract = {Respond to J. F. Kihlstrom's (see record [rid]1986-21976-001[/rid]) comments regarding the present author and M. J. Harris's (see record [rid]1986-20971-001[/rid]) reanalysis of W. Mischel's (see record [rid]1985-06679-001[/rid]) data relating to the influence of personality and situational variables on the delay of gratification by clarifying that the intention of the article by the present author and Harris was not to establish the superiority of personality variables relative to cognitive ones but to counter the frequent implication that cognitive factors can be preferred on the grounds of effect size alone.

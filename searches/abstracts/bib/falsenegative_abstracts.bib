Abstract = {In this paper, we consider voxel selection for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain data with the aim of finding a more complete set of probably correlated discriminative voxels, thus improving interpretation of the discovered potential biomarkers. The main difficulty in doing this is an extremely high dimensional voxel space and few training samples, resulting in unreliable feature selection. In order to deal with the difficulty, stability selection has received a great deal of attention lately, especially due to its finite sample control of false discoveries and transparent principle for choosing a proper amount of regularization. However, it fails to make explicit use of the correlation property or structural information of these discriminative features and leads to large false negative rates. In other words, many relevant but probably correlated discriminative voxels are missed. Thus, we propose a new variant on stability selection “randomized structural sparsity”, which incorporates the idea of structural sparsity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method can be superior in controlling for false negatives while also keeping the control of false positives inherited from stability selection.

Abstract = {Objective: To identify patient characteristics associated with concordance of Medicare claims with clinically identified depression. Methods: The authors studied a cohort of 742 older primary care patients linked to Medicare claims data using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition major depressive disorder and clinically significant minor depression. Results: Among 474 patients with depression, 198 patients had a Medicare claim for depression (sensitivity: 42%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 37%–46%). Among 268 patients who did not meet criteria for depression, 235 patients did not have a Medicare claim for depression (specificity: 88%; 95% CI: 83%–91%). After adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, non-white participants were nearly twice as likely not to have Medicare claims for depression among patients who met criteria for depression (“false negatives”). Smoking status, depression severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), cardiovascular disease, and more primary care physician office visits were also significantly associated with decreased odds to be false negatives. In contrast, after covariate adjustment, white race and chronic pulmonary disease were associated with increased odds of a Medicare claim for depression among patients who did not meet criteria for depression (“false positives”). Using weights based on the screened sample, the positive predictive value of a Medicare claim for depression was 66% (95% CI [63%, 69%]), whereas the negative predictive value was 77% (95% CI [76%, 78%]). Conclusion: Investigators using Medicare data to study depression must recognize that diagnoses of depression from Medicare data may be biased by patient ethnicity and the presence of medical comorbidity.

Abstract = {The scientific community has witnessed growing concern about the high rate of false positives and unreliable results within the psychological literature, but the harmful impact of false negatives has been largely ignored. False negatives are particularly concerning in research areas where demonstrating the absence of an effect is crucial, such as studies of unconscious or implicit processing. Research on implicit processes seeks evidence of above-chance performance on some implicit behavioral measure at the same time as chance-level performance (that is, a null result) on an explicit measure of awareness. A systematic review of 73 studies of contextual cuing, a popular implicit learning paradigm, involving 181 statistical analyses of awareness tests, reveals how underpowered studies can lead to failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Among the studies that reported sufficient information, the meta-analytic effect size across awareness tests was d z = 0.31 (95 % CI 0.24–0.37), showing that participants’ learning in these experiments was conscious. The unusually large number of positive results in this literature cannot be explained by selective publication. Instead, our analyses demonstrate that these tests are typically insensitive and underpowered to detect medium to small, but true, effects in awareness tests. These findings challenge a widespread and theoretically important claim about the extent of unconscious human cognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Meta-analyses indicate 50% of cases of depression are not detected by GPs. It is important to examine patient and GP characteristics associated with misclassification so that systems can be improved to increase accurate detection and optimal management for groups at risk of depression. Objective: To examine patient and GP characteristics associated with GP misclassification of depression for patients classified by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 as depressed. Methods: A cross-sectional study within general practices in two states of Australia. GPs completed a one-page paper and pencil survey indicating whether they thought each patient was clinically depressed. Patients completed a computer tablet survey while waiting for their appointment to provide demographic information and indicate depression status. Chi-square analyses were used to determine whether patient and GP characteristics were associated with a false-negative and false-positive result. The probability of misclassification was modelled using Generalized Estimating Equations to account for clustering of patients. Results: Fifty GPs from 12 practices participated. GPs completed surveys for 1880 patients. Younger patients aged 25–44, and those with a health care card were less likely to have a false-negative assessment. Patients with 0–3 GP visits in the past 12 months, and those with private health insurance were less likely to have a false-positive assessment. GPs who worked five sessions or fewer per week were more likely to make false-positive assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the ability of the central sensitization inventory (CSI), a new screening instrument, to assist clinicians in identifying patients with central sensitivity syndromes (CSSs). Methods: Patients from a psychiatric medical practice (N = 161), which specialized in the assessment and treatment of complex pain and psychophysiological disorders, were assessed for the presence of a CSS. CSI scores, using a previously determined cutoff of “40” of “100,” were compared between the CSS patient group (n = 99) and the non-CSS patient group (n = 62). Information on false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives were analyzed, and sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted. In addition, CSS-relevant variables such as depression, abuse, and substance abuse were examined. Results: A large percentage of CSS patients had comorbid major depressive disorder (80%) and abuse history (43%), which was higher than rates for the patients without a CSS (55% and 24%, respectively). The CSI correctly identified 82.8% (n = 82) of CSS patients as having a CSS (ie, sensitivity) and 54.8% (n = 28) of non-CSS patients as not having a CSS (ie, specificity). False-positive patients (not diagnosed with a CSS, but scoring >40 on the CSI) reported more severe pain, interference in daily functioning, and abuse history, compared with the non-CSS patients who scored below 40 (ie, true negatives). Conclusions: The CSI is a useful and valid instrument for screening patients for the possibility of a CSS, although the chances of false positives are relatively high when evaluating patients with complex pain and psychophysiological disorders.

Abstract = {Background: Family history of migraine is the most potent and consistent risk factor for migraine. However, there has been limited systematic research on the reliability of family history information in detecting migraine based on valid diagnostic interviews. This study systematically evaluated the accuracy of migraine defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD‐II) based on a direct structured interview compared to structured family history reports. The aim of the present study was to assess the validity of migraine diagnosis provided by family history compared with direct interview using a validated diagnostic interview of headache syndromes in the context of a family study of migraine comorbidity. Methods: The sample included 921 study participants identified in a cross‐sectional community‐based controlled family study of comorbidity of migraine and affective disorders recruited from the greater Washington, DC community. Lifetime migraine and tension‐type headache were ascertained by direct clinical interview using a validated interview that collects ICHD‐II criteria for headache syndromes. A structured history of headache was also collected from all interviewed probands and relatives regarding their relatives. All family history reports were reviewed by the study neurologist according to ICHD‐II criteria. Family history ratings and diagnoses were made by the neurologist, who was blinded to the headache diagnosis obtained by direct interview. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of family history reports of migraine compared with direct interview were 38.6% and 96.8%, respectively, indicating that the false positive rate was very low, whereas the false negative rate was substantial. The positive and negative predictive values of migraine diagnosis provided by family member report are 90.0% and 67.6%, respectively. Conclusions: Our results confirm that migraine assessed by family member report largely underestimates migraine in relatives. This demonstrates the value of direct interviews with relatives rather than reliance on family history report in both clinical practice and family and genetic studies. Potential steps to improve the reliability of family history report in clinical settings are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommendations propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop a concise and concrete list of core research dependability recommendations that address problems of false positive and false negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the current research dependability literature and earlier literatures dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth seeking mindset during the research endeavor.

Abstract = {The negative features of false memories are frequently at the foreground of false memory research. However, it has become increasingly apparent that false memories also have positive consequences. In two experiments, we examined the positive consequences of false memories. Participants were visually presented with false memory word lists and received a recognition task. In a modified perceptual closure test, participants received degraded visual representations of words (false, true, and unrelated items) that became clearer over time. Participants had to identify them as fast as possible. Identifications based on false memories were significantly faster than those based on true memories and (un)related items. A roughly similar pattern was observed when no recognition task was used and when critical lures were replaced with other items (Experiment 2). Our results indicate that false memories can be beneficial for problem-solving tasks and counter the standard perspective that false memories are inherently negative in nature.

Abstract = {Objective: To explore the accuracy rate of the comparison question test (CQT) by Binomial Distribution way on field cases in Chengdu area of China. In detail, the study revealed the accuracy rate of detecting guilty and innocent examinees, and the rate of False Positive and False Negative. Method: The study was built on the field cases with only two examinees that held the opposite opinions to the same single case. The original evaluators and four experienced polygraph specialists independently chose and scored 148 field criminal cases into the final study, among which 111 paired-records were concluded as indicative records and the rest, 37 ones, were ruled as non-indicative. Result: Judging from all records, the accuracy rate of detecting guilty examinees was 0.836 with a 0.164 False Negative rate. In addition, the rate to detect innocents was 0.822 with a 0.178 False Positive rate. Judging from indicative cases only excluding the non-indicative, the accuracy rate rose to 0.958 for perceiving guilty examinees with a 0.042 False Negative rate. To innocents, the accuracy rate was 0.859 with a 0.141 False Positive rate. Conclusion: The study with non-standard methodology was not limited to mock cases and the final confessions. It was able to estimate validity of other lie-detection ways, GKT, POT, etc., with this method being applied. With high accuracy rate and validity, polygraph examinations were able to give better decisions to real-life investigations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Emotional disorders have been related with attentional and memory biases, especially for emotional material. Recent research has shown that depression, dysphoria and high internalizing traits are related with an increase of false memories for negative events. However, it is not clear whether anxiety alone may imply the same effect and whether it applies to all emotional events or only negative ones. The present study examined these questions by using a paradigm based on pictorial scripted material to analyze inferential memory errors for negative, positive and neutral everyday events in high-anxious vs. control young adults. Results showed an increase in negative (but not positive) inferential false memories in high-anxious individuals, even after controlling for depression level. On the contrary, negative material reduced false memories in control participants, further supporting previous research. It is concluded that high trait anxiety enhances elaboration of negative emotional material, which eventually leads to misremember causal antecedents of negative events as previously experienced while they were only inferred.

Abstract = {In this study, we used invasive tracing to evaluate white matter tractography methods based on ex vivo diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dwMRI) data. A representative selection of tractography methods were compared to manganese tracing on a voxel‐wise basis, and a more qualitative assessment examined whether, and to what extent, certain fiber tracts and gray matter targets were reached. While the voxel‐wise agreement was very limited, qualitative assessment revealed that tractography is capable of finding the major fiber tracts, although there were some differences between the methods. However, false positive connections were very common and, in particular, we discovered that it is not possible to achieve high sensitivity (i.e., few false negatives) and high specificity (i.e., few false positives) at the same time. Closer inspection of the results led to the conclusion that these problems mainly originate from regions with complex fiber arrangements or high curvature and are not easily resolved by sophisticated local models alone. Instead, the crucial challenge in making tractography a truly useful and reliable tool in brain research and neurology lies in the acquisition of better data. In particular, the increase of spatial resolution, under preservation of the signal‐to‐noise‐ratio, is key. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {This study tested the validity of the School-aged Assessment of Attachment (SAA) in terms of matches from the well-validated Preschool Assessment of Attachment (PAA) to the SAA 6 months later. It also addressed validity in terms of mental health services and measures of stress, depression and anxiety. Hypotheses: Children’s SAA classifications were predicted to match their 6 months’ previous PAA classifications and indicators of maternal, child and family stress. The study used a two-group comparative design, involving normative and clinical children and their mothers. Method: The participants were 50 children between 5.5 and 5.9 years of age. Each child participated with his or her mother in a PAA, and then 6 months later each child responded to the SAA story cards as well as self-report assessments of stress, anxiety and depression. Results: Concordance of A, B, C and A/C attachment classifications was found between the PAA and SAA in 34 of 48 children. There was a strong relation between referral status (clinical or normative) and both PAA and SAA attachment classifications. In every non-matching case, a normative child had an attachment classification indicative of risk, indicating that the direction of errors was false positives as opposed to false negatives. Conclusions: This evidence supports the validity and clinical utility of the SAA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Context: Depression is common among patients with advanced disease but often difficult to detect. Objectives: To assess the Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS) (10 items) against the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-10 total score and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-Depression subscale total score and determine if the POS has appropriate items to screen for depression among people with advanced disease. Methods: This was a secondary analysis performed on five studies. Four psychometric properties were assessed: data quality, scaling assumptions, acceptability, and internal consistency (reliability). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the area under the curve. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, false positive and negative rates, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were computed. Results: The overall sample had 416 patients from Germany and England: 144 had cancer and 267 had nonmalignant conditions. Prevalence of depression across the sample was 17.5%. Floor and ceiling effects were rare. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for POS items 7 and 8 summed, GDS-10 and HADS-Depression items varied: 0.61 (heart failure) and 0.80 (cancer). Two items combined (Item 7dfeeling depressed and Item 8dfeeling good about yourself) consistently presented the highest area under the ROC curve, ranging from 0.76 (95% CI 0.60, 0.93) (Germany, lung cancer) to 0.97 (95% CI 0.91, 1.0) (heart failure), highest negative predictive value, and lowest false negative rate. For the overall sample, the cutoff 2/3 presented a negative predictive value of 89.4% (95% CI 84.7, 92.8) and false negative rate of 10.6 (95% CI 7.2, 15.3). Conclusion: POS items 7 and 8 summed are potentially useful to screen for depression in advanced disease populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In recent years, a robust movement has emerged within psychology to increase the evidentiary value of our science. This movement, which has analogs throughout the empirical sciences, is broad and diverse, but its primary emphasis has been on the reduction of statistical false positives. The present article addresses epistemological and pragmatic issues that we, as a field, must consider as we seek to maximize the scientific value of this movement. Regarding epistemology, this article contrasts the false-positives-reduction (FPR) approach with an alternative, the error balance (EB) approach, which argues that any serious consideration of optimal scientific practice must contend simultaneously with both false-positive and false-negative errors. Regarding pragmatics, the movement has devoted a great deal of attention to issues that frequently arise in laboratory experiments and one-shot survey studies, but it has devoted less attention to issues that frequently arise in intensive and/or longitudinal studies. We illustrate these epistemological and pragmatic considerations with the case of relationship science, one of the many research domains that frequently employ intensive and/or longitudinal methods. Specifically, we examine 6 research prescriptions that can help to reduce false-positive rates: preregistration, prepublication sharing of materials, postpublication sharing of data, close replication, avoiding piecemeal publication, and increasing sample size. For each, we offer concrete guidance not only regarding how researchers can improve their research practices and balance the risk of false-positive and false-negative errors, but also how the movement can capitalize upon insights from research practices within relationship science to make the movement stronger and more inclusive.

Abstract = {These studies are based on the assumption that when adults, adolescents, or children identify someone as the “guilty” one (the person who committed the act), they are not only making an identification based on memory and thinking, but also a moral decision. This is because, by the act of identifying or not identifying someone, the eyewitness runs the risk of either convicting an innocent person (making a false-positive error) or letting a guilty person go free (a false-negative error). Our interest is less in the overall accuracy of their identifications and more in the balance of false-positive and false-negative errors. We have found in these and past studies that the balance of these 2 kinds of errors changes with age, and that this pattern may also depend on (a) the child’s general understanding of the purpose of the task, which appears to be “lost” on 7- to 9-year-olds, the youngest group studied, and (b) for older children and adolescents, how the act is described; for example, intended or not. In this way, we can understand that the act of identifying the perpetrator as a moral decision and not simply an act of perception and memory.

Abstract = {Previous research has revealed robust differences between young and older adults' accurate emotional memory. Typically, negative emotion prompts memory performance in young adults, while positive emotion benefits memory performance in older adults. Relatively, much less efforts have been devoted to investigating how emotion divergently influences false memory in older adults compared to young adults. The main purpose of the present study is to explore, first, how age alters the effects of emotional valence on false memory; and second, what are the cognitive mechanisms for the interaction effect of age and emotional valence on false memory. The Fuzzy Trace Theory (FTT) uses verbatim memory trace and gist memory trace to interpret individuals' false memory, especially false memory under the framework of Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. According to recent research, we proposed some flaws of traditional paradigms (such as the Remember-Know paradigm) in the area of false memory; and we also argued that it would be critical to include response bias in addition to verbatim and gist memory trace to investigate false memory. To fulfill this need, the simplified conjoint recognition (SCR) paradigm, combined with a statistical method of multinomial processing tree model, was used in the present study to investigate false memory and its associated cognitive mechanisms. A sample of 34 young adults (aged 23 ± 2 years) and 28 older adults (aged 68 ± 5 years) completed the SCR task. In the task, the Cornell/Cortland emotion word lists, along with neutral word lists adopted from previous research, were implemented as experimental materials. The results displayed a significant interaction effect of emotional valence and age on false memory (i.e. false alarm). Specifically, positive emotion decreased older adults' false memory, while negative emotion decreased young adults' false memory. The method of multinomial processing tree model was further employed to model, parameterize and inference the cognitive mechanisms related to the effect of emotional valence on false memory within young and older group. It was found that negative emotion contributed to a lower level of false memory in young adults by lowering their response bias toward negative words. As to older adults, positive emotion boosted retrieval of verbatim memory trace and hampered retrieval of gist memory trace, then led to less false memory for positive words. Our study uncovered interesting age-related differences in emotional false memory; it also confirmed the necessity of a simultaneous consideration of verbatim memory trace, gist memory trace and response bias when investigating false memory.

Abstract = {This study investigated whether negative outcomes constrain young children's understanding of false beliefs on morally relevant false belief tasks. Participants (3-6 year-olds, N = 71) were presented with three kinds of morally relevant false belief situations, in which the same false belief accidentally caused morally negative, positive, or neutral outcomes. In addition to identifying an actor's false beliefs, children were asked to evaluate the act itself and to justify their evaluations. The results showed that young children gave fewer correct answers under negative and neutral conditions of morally relevant false belief tasks than they did on standard false belief tasks. Even children who passed the false belief tasks were affected by morally negative outcomes in evaluating the acts, but they gave more intentional reasons to justify their evaluations than did children who did not pass these tasks. These findings suggest that identifying morally relevant false beliefs is a challenge for young children because of their bias against negative outcomes, and also due to the inherent complexity of such situations.

Abstract = {When prediction using a diagnostic test outperforms simple prediction using base rates, the test is said to be “clinically efficient,” a term first introduced into the literature by Meehl and Rosen (1955) in Psychological Bulletin. This article provides three equivalent conditions for determining the clinical efficiency of a diagnostic test: (a) Meehl-Rosen (Meehl & Rosen, 1955); (b) Dawes (Dawes, 1962); and (c) the Bokhari-Hubert condition, introduced here for the first time. Clinical efficiency is then generalized to situations where misclassification costs are considered unequal (for example, false negatives are more costly than false positives). As an illustration, the clinical efficiency of an actuarial device for predicting violent and dangerous behavior is examined that was developed as part of the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study.

Abstract = {A new probability-based standard setting technique, the Objective Borderline Method (OBM), was introduced recently. This was based on a mathematical model of how test scores relate to student ability. The present study refined the model and tested it using 2500 simulated data-sets. The OBM was feasible to use. On average, the OBM performed well with specificity .88, sensitivity .51, false positive rate 3.4% and false negative rate 26%. These indices were insensitive to the borderline score range. This probability-based standard setting may be a useful addition to the range of standard setting methods available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Advances in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) have led to many alternative diffusion sampling strategies and analysis methodologies. A common objective among methods is estimation of white matter fiber orientations within each voxel, as doing so permits in-vivo fiber-tracking and the ability to study brain connectivity and networks. Knowledge of how DW-MRI sampling schemes affect fiber estimation accuracy, tractography and the ability to recover complex white-matter pathways, differences between results due to choice of analysis method, and which method(s) perform optimally for specific data sets, all remain important problems, especially as tractography-based studies become common. In this work, we begin to address these concerns by developing sets of simulated diffusion-weighted brain images which we then use to quantitatively evaluate the performance of six DW-MRI analysis methods in terms of estimated fiber orientation accuracy, false-positive (spurious) and false-negative (missing) fiber rates, and fiber-tracking. The analysis methods studied are: 1) a two-compartment “ball and stick” model (BSM) (Behrens et al., 2003); 2) a non-negativity constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) approach (Tournier et al., 2007); 3) analytical q-ball imaging (QBI) (Descoteaux et al., 2007); 4) q-ball imaging with Funk–Radon and Cosine Transform (FRACT) (Haldar and Leahy, 2013); 5) q-ball imaging within constant solid angle (CSA) (Aganj et al., 2010); and 6) a generalized Fourier transform approach known as generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) (Yeh et al., 2010). We investigate these methods using 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 evenly distributed q-space samples of a single shell, and focus on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 18) and diffusion-weighting (b = 1000 s/mm²) common to clinical studies. We found that the BSM and CSD methods consistently yielded the least fiber orientation error and simultaneously greatest detection rate of fibers. Fiber detection rate was found to be the most distinguishing characteristic between the methods, and a significant factor for complete recovery of tractography through complex white-matter pathways. For example, while all methods recovered similar tractography of prominent white matter pathways of limited fiber crossing, CSD (which had the highest fiber detection rate, especially for voxels containing three fibers) recovered the greatest number of fibers and largest fraction of correct tractography for complex three-fiber crossing regions.

Abstract = {When making statistical comparisons, the temporal dimension of the EEG signal introduces problems. Guthrie and Buchwald (1991) proposed a formally correct statistical approach that deals with these problems: comparing waveforms by counting the number of successive significant univariate tests and then contrasting this number to a well‐chosen critical value. However, in the literature, this method is often used inappropriately. Using real EEG data and Monte Carlo simulations, we examined the problems associated with the incorrect use of this approach under circumstances often encountered in the literature. Our results show inflated false‐positive or false‐negative rates depending on parameters of the data, including filtering. Our findings suggest that most applications of this method result in an inappropriate familywise error rate control. Solutions and alternative methods are discussed.

Abstract = {Decreased myocardial uptake of I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is an important finding for diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study compared I-123 MIBG SPECT and planar imaging with regard to their diagnostic yield for PD. 52 clinically diagnosed PD patients who also had decreased striatal uptake on FP-CIT PET/CT were enrolled. 16 normal controls were also included. All underwent cardiac MIBG planar scintigraphy and SPECT separately. Myocardial I-123 MIBG uptake was interpreted on planar and SPECT/CT images separately by visual and quantitative analysis. The final diagnosis was made by consensus between two readers. Kappa analyses were performed to determine inter-observer agreement for both methods. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared with McNemar’s test. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 84.6, 100, and 88.2 % for planar images and 96.2, 100 and 97.1 % for SPECT, respectively, with a significant difference between the two imaging methods (p < 0.031). All inter-observer agreements were almost perfect (planar scintigraphy: κ = 0.82; SPECT: κ = 0.93). Heart-to-mediastinum ratios from PD patients with negative planar and positive SPECT scans (group A) and patients with positive planar and positive SPECT scans (group B) were 1.69 ± 0.16 (1.59–1.85) and 1.41 ± 0.15 (1.20–1.53), respectively, and showed significant difference (p = 0.023). Lung-to-mediastinum ratios for groups A and B were 2.16 ± 0.20 (1.96–2.37) and 1.6 ± 0.19 (1.3–1.78), respectively, and were significantly higher in the former (p = 0.001). I-123 MIBG SPECT has a significantly higher diagnostic performance for PD than planar images. Increased lung uptake may cause false-negative results on planar imaging.

Abstract = {Tests that measure the emotional and behavioral problems of children and youth are typically not normed and standardized on youth diagnosed with disruptive behavior, particularly those youth in residential care. Yet professional standards mandate that before instruments are used with a specific population the psychometric properties need to be studied and re-established: specifically, psychometric properties, including validity, need to be evaluated (AERA, APA, and NCME, The standards for educational and psychological testing. AERA, Washington, DC, 1999). The purpose of the present study was to assess the validity characteristics of the Symptoms and Functioning Severity Scale (SFSS; Bickman et al., Manual of the Peabody Treatment Progress Battery, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, 2010), a widely used test developed for use in outpatient clinics, with youth in a residential care program. The convergent validity of the SFSS was established with the large correlations (0.78–0.86) with the CBCL. Several binary classification analyses including specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and the Youden Index supported the validity of the SFSS. However, the sensitivity index was somewhat low indicating the test may produce a high level of false negatives. Limitations, future research and implications are discussed.

Abstract = {Objectives Expressed emotion (EE), or the presence of criticism/hostility/emotional overinvolvement in a family relationship, predicts poorer outcomes in bipolar disorder; however, the mechanism of this is unclear. The present study investigated whether, in a sample of young adults (aged 18–40 years) with bipolar disorder, parental criticism was associated with Behavioral Approach System (BAS) dysregulation, including emotional reactivity to negative feedback and cognitive schemas of self‐criticism/perfectionism. Method Twenty‐two young adults with bipolar I disorder and 22 matched control participants completed an interview, questionnaires, and a computer‐based task with false negative feedback; emotional reactivity to this feedback was assessed. Results Compared to control participants, clinical participants exhibited higher levels (p = 0.001) of self‐criticism, and a trend towards a greater decrease in positive affect after negative feedback (p = 0.053), even when controlling for mood symptoms. Among clinical participants, perceived criticism from paternal caregivers was associated with self‐criticism and perfectionism, and low perceived paternal care was associated with decrease in positive affect. Conclusion Strain in parental relationships may be associated with BAS dysregulation for individuals with bipolar disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The density hypothesis states that positive information is more similar than negative information, resulting in higher density of positive information in mental representations. The present research applies the density hypothesis to recognition memory to explain apparent valence asymmetries in recognition memory, namely, a recognition advantage for negative information. Previous research explained this negativity advantage on the basis of valence-induced affect. We predicted that positive information’s higher density impairs recognition performance. Two old–new word recognition experiments tested whether differential density between positive and negative stimuli creates a negativity advantage in recognition memory, over and above valence-induced affect. In Experiment 1, participants better discriminated negative word stimuli (i.e., less false alarms) and showed a response bias towards positive words. Regression analyses showed the asymmetry to be function of density and not of valence. Experiment 2 varied stimulus density orthogonal to valence. Again, discriminability and response bias were a function of density and not of valence. We conclude that the higher density of positive information causes an apparent valence asymmetry in recognition memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A sudden collective collapse of an entire sport team is often described in terms of the social contagion of weak performance. Two experiments studied this phenomenon against the backdrop of balance theory. Experiment 1 examined whether false negative feedback on a partner's performance during a team task would lead to compensatory mechanisms as predicted by balance theory. Results showed that perceived negative performance in the partner was compensated by devaluing the relationship to the partner. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 and investigated the impact of physical self-esteem. Results showed that persons with strong physical self-esteem devalued the situational value of the relationship when they perceived their partner's performance to be negative. Experiment 2 also investigated objective performance. Although failing to attain statistical significance, there was a tendency for the perceived sudden decline in the partner's performance to be contagious. It is concluded that balance theory offers promising insights into the interpersonal dynamics of social contagion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: To present a Greek family in which 5 male and 2 female members developed progressive spastic paraplegia. Plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) were reportedly normal at first testing in an affected male and for over 30years the presumed diagnosis was hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was used as a further diagnostic tool. Methods: Targeted exome sequencing in the proband, followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation; mutation segregation testing in multiple family members and plasma VLCFA measurement in the proband. Results: NGS of the proband revealed a novel frameshift mutation in ABCD1 (c.1174_1178del, p.Leu392Serfs*7), bringing an end to diagnostic uncertainty by establishing the diagnosis of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the myelopathic phenotype of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The mutation segregated in all family members and the diagnosis of AMN/ALD was confirmed by plasma VLCFA measurement. Confounding factors that delayed the diagnosis are presented. Conclusions: This report highlights the diagnostic utility of NGS in patients with undiagnosed spastic paraplegia, establishing a molecular diagnosis of AMN, allowing proper genetic counseling and management, and overcoming the diagnostic delay that can be rarely caused by false negative VLCFA analysis.

Abstract = {Objective: Features of bipolarity in a major depressive disorder sample were used to define a “bipolar spectrum disorder” population for treatment with a neuroleptic agent, ziprasidone. Methods: Forty-nine acutely depressed patients were randomized to ziprasidone-washout-placebo or placebo-washout-ziprasidone in this double-blind, prospective, 13-week crossover trial. All patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for a major depressive episode and were positive for at least 3 predictors of bipolarity: family history of bipolar disorder, antidepressant-induced mania, highly recurrent depressive episodes (>5), atypical depression, early onset of depression (<age 20), failure to respond to antidepressants or antidepressant tolerance. The most common bipolarity inclusion criteria were antidepressant tolerance and nonresponse, and atypical depression. Approximately 52% received ziprasidone in monotherapy, 48% as adjunct to antidepressants. Results: There was a small statistically nonsignificant benefit with ziprasidone compared with placebo on Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale change [−1.5 (p = 0.48)]. Statistical carryover effects were observed. Conclusions: Ziprasidone, alone or added to antidepressants, was not more effective than placebo in this population. A false-negative finding due to the crossover design is suggested by statistical carryover effects. Alternatively, this definition of bipolar spectrum illness may have been too nonspecific to show neuroleptic benefit, unlike other definitions, like “mixed depression.” Also, this study did not test potential neuroleptic efficacy without the potentially mood-destabilizing effects of antidepressants.

Abstract = {Previous research has attributed to the right hemisphere (RH) a key role in eliciting false memories to visual emotional stimuli. These results have been explained in terms of two right-hemisphere properties: (i) that emotional stimuli are preferentially processed in the RH and (ii) that visual stimuli are represented more coarsely in the RH. According to this account, false emotional memories are preferentially produced in the RH because emotional stimuli are both more strongly and more diffusely activated during encoding, leaving a memory trace that can be erroneously reactivated by similar but unstudied emotional items at test. If this right-hemisphere hypothesis is correct, then RH damage should result in a reduction in false memories to emotional stimuli relative to left-hemisphere lesions. To investigate this possibility, groups of right-brain-damaged (RBD, N = 15), left-brain-damaged (LBD, N = 15) and healthy (HC, N = 30) participants took part in a recognition memory experiment with emotional (negative and positive) and non-emotional pictures. False memories were operationalized as incorrect responses to unstudied pictures that were similar to studied ones. Both RBD and LBD participants showed similar reductions in false memories for negative pictures relative to controls. For positive pictures, however, false memories were reduced only in RBD patients. The results provide only partial support for the right-hemisphere hypothesis and suggest that inter-hemispheric cooperation models may be necessary to fully account for false emotional memories.

Abstract = {The application of finite mixture regression models has recently gained an interest from highway safety researchers because of its considerable potential for addressing unobserved heterogeneity. Finite mixture models assume that the observations of a sample arise from two or more unobserved components with unknown proportions. Both fixed and varying weight parameter models have been shown to be useful for explaining the heterogeneity and the nature of the dispersion in crash data. Given the superior performance of the finite mixture model, this study, using observed and simulated data, investigated the relative performance of the finite mixture model and the traditional negative binomial (NB) model in terms of hotspot identification. For the observed data, rural multilane segment crash data for divided highways in California and Texas were used. The results showed that the difference measured by the percentage deviation in ranking orders was relatively small for this dataset. Nevertheless, the ranking results from the finite mixture model were considered more reliable than the NB model because of the better model specification. This finding was also supported by the simulation study which produced a high number of false positives and negatives when a mis-specified model was used for hotspot identification. Regarding an optimal threshold value for identifying hotspots, another simulation analysis indicated that there is a discrepancy between false discovery (increasing) and false negative rates (decreasing). Since the costs associated with false positives and false negatives are different, it is suggested that the selected optimal threshold value should be decided by considering the trade-offs between these two costs so that unnecessary expenses are minimized.

Abstract = {Introduction: Confirming abstinence during smoking cessation clinical trials is critical for determining treatment effectiveness. Several biological methods exist for verifying abstinence (e.g., exhaled carbon monoxide [CO], cotinine), and while cotinine provides a longer window of detection, it is not easily used in trials involving nicotine replacement therapy. The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco’s Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification cite 8–10 parts per million (ppm) for CO as a viable cutoff to determine abstinence; however, recent literature suggests this cutoff is likely too high and may overestimate the efficacy of treatment. Methods: This study examined the relationship between CO and cotinine in a sample of 662 individuals participating in a smoking cessation clinical trial. A receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to determine the percentage of false positives and false negatives at given CO levels when using cotinine as confirmation of abstinence. Differences were also examined across race and gender. Results: A CO cutoff of 3 ppm (97.1% correct classification) most accurately distinguished smokers from nonsmokers. This same cutoff was accurate for both racial and gender groups. The standard cutoffs of 8 ppm (14.0% misclassification of smokers as abstainers) and 10 ppm (20.6% misclassification of smokers as abstainers) produced very high false-negative rates and inaccurately identified a large part of the sample as being abstinent when their cotinine test identified them as still smoking. Conclusions: It is recommended that researchers and clinicians adopt a more stringent CO cutoff in the range of 3–4 ppm when complete abstinence from smoking is the goal.

Abstract = {Background: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the frataxin (FXN) gene, resulting in reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has led to a growing need for informative biomarkers to assess disease progression and response to therapeutic intervention. Objective: To evaluate the performance of frataxin measurements as a diagnostic tool using two different immunoassays. Methods: Clinical and demographic information was provided through an ongoing longitudinal natural history study on FRDA. Frataxin protein levels from multiple cell types in controls, carriers and FRDA patients were measured and compared using a lateral flow immunoassay and a Luminex xMAP-based immunoassay. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were then performed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each immunoassay. Results: For whole blood and buccal cells, analysing FRDA patients and carriers together in a cohort resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values compared with analyzing controls and carriers together, with similar results between each tissue type. We then compared the usefulness of a lateral flow immunoassay with a multianalyte Luminex xMAP-based immunoassay, and showed that both assays demonstrate high positive predictive values with low rates of false negatives and false positives. Conclusions: Frataxin measurements from peripheral tissues can be used to identify FRDA patients and carriers. While multiple cell types and assays may be useful for diagnostic purposes, each assay and cell type used has its advantages and disadvantages depending on study design and scope.

Abstract = {Background: Compared to DSM-IV, the criteria for diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been modified in DSM-5. Objective: The first aim of this study was to examine how these modifications impact rates of PTSD in a sample of Congolese ex-combatants. The second goal of this study was to investigate whether PTSD symptoms were associated with perpetrator-related acts or victim-related traumatic events. Method: Ninety-five male ex-combatants in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo were interviewed. Both the DSM-IV and the DSM-5 PTSD symptom criteria were assessed. Results: The DSM-5 symptom criteria yielded a PTSD rate of 50% (n = 47), whereas the DSM-IV symptom criteria were met by 44% (n = 42). If the DSM-5 would be set as the current "gold standard," then DSM-IV would have produced more false negatives (8%) than false positives (3%). A minority of participants (19%, n = 18) indicated an event during which they were involved as a perpetrator as their most stressful event. Results of a regression analysis (R² = 0.40) showed that, after accounting for the number of types of traumatic events, perpetrated violent acts were not associated with the symptom severity of PTSD. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that more diagnostic cases were produced with the DSM-5 diagnostic rules than were dropped resulting in an increase in PTSD rates compared to the DSM-IV system. The missing association between PTSD symptoms and perpetrated violent acts might be explained by a potential fascinating and excited perception of these acts.

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of functional MRI (fMRI) at 3T, as currently used in the preoperative mapping of language areas, compared with direct cortical stimulation (DCS) during awake surgery, in patients with supratentorial gliomas; and to identify clinical, histopathologic, and radiologic factors associated with fMRI/DCS discrepancies. Methods: Language mapping with fMRI and DCS of 40 consecutive patients with gliomas (24 low-grade, 16 high-grade) in functional areas were retrospectively analyzed. Three blockdesigned tasks were performed during fMRI (letter word generation, category word generation, semantic association). During awake surgery, eloquent areas were mapped using DCS, blinded to fMRI. A site-by-site comparison of the 2 techniques was performed using a cortical grid. fMRI sensitivity and specificity were calculated using DCS as the reference. Associations of clinical, histopathologic, and radiologic features (including relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV] measured with dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI) with fMRI false-positive and false-negative occurrence were assessed using hierarchical logistic regressions. Results: Of 2,114 stimulated cortical sites, 103 were positive for language during DCS. Sensitivity and specificity of language fMRI combining the 3 tasks reached 37.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 20.7–57.2) and 83.4% (95% CI 77.1–88.3), respectively. Astrocytoma subtype (odds ratio [OR] 2.50 [1.32–4.76]; p = 0.007), tumor rCBV <1.5 (OR 2.17 [1.08–4.35]; p = 0.03), higher cortical rCBV (OR 2.22 [1.15–4.17]; p = 0.02), and distance to tumor >1 cm (OR 2.46 [1.82–3.32]; p ≤ 0.001) were independently associated with fMRI false-positive occurrence. Conclusions: There are pitfalls in preoperative fMRI as currently used in preoperative language mapping in glioma patients, made more complicated when high-grade and hyperperfused tumors are evaluated.

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the Work Ability Index (WAI) as a tool to screen for risk of different durations of long-term sickness absence (LTSA) among manual and office workers. Methods: The prospective study comprised a cohort of 3049 (1710 manual and 1339 office) workers participating in occupational health surveys between 2010–2012. The survey date was set as baseline and incident LTSA episodes of different duration (> 14, > 28, > 42, > 60, and > 90 days) were retrieved from an occupational health register in the year following the survey. Baseline WAI scores were associated with LTSA episodes occurring (no/yes) during one-year follow-up by logistic regression analysis in a random sample (N = 1000) of the cohort. Predictions of LTSA risk were then validated among the workers not included in the random sample. Results: The odds of LTSA episodes at follow-up decreased with increasing baseline WAI scores (ie, better work ability). The WAI accurately predicted the risk of future LTSA episodes > 28, > 42, > 60 days, but over-predicted the risk of LTSA episodes > 14 and > 90 days. The WAI discriminated between workers at high and low risk of LTSA episodes of all durations. Office workers had higher WAI scores than manual workers. Consequently, false-negative rates were higher among office workers and false-positive rates were higher among manual workers at each WAI cut-off point. Conclusion: The WAI could be used to screen both manual and office workers for risk of LTSA episodes lasting > 28, > 42, > 60 days. WAI cut-off points depend on the objectives of screening and may differ for manual and office workers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In two studies we investigate whether social exclusion—a well-studied, common and quite painful social experience-influences people's perceptions of novel social networks. In a first study, exclusion experiences led people to report that novel networks were more dense relative to those who had not been excluded. As predicted, this was true only for social networks; exclusion had no impact on perceptions when networks were described as geographical. In a follow-up experiment, participants watched a custom-created video, depicting avatars interacting in social scenes and they were asked to report the ties among the avatars in the video. Exclusion experiences led people to see network ties where none exist (i.e., false positives), though there was no effect for exclusion (versus inclusion) on reports of false negatives. Results indicate that common social experiences systematically shape network perceptions, leading people to seeing novel social networks as more densely connected than they are.

Abstract = {Mood is a key element of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and is perceived as a highly dynamic construct. The aim of the current study was to examine whether a single-item mood scale can be used for mood monitoring. One hundred thirty remitted out-patients were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders (SCID-I), Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS), 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D₁₇), and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR). Of all patients, 13.8% relapsed during follow-up assessments. Area under the curves (AUCs) for the VAMS, HAM-D₁₇ and IDS-SR were 0.94, 0.91, and, 0.86, respectively. The VAMS had the highest positive predictive value (PPV) without any false negatives at score 55 (PPV = 0.53; NPV = 1.0) and was the best predictor of current relapse status (variance explained for VAMS: 60%; for HAM-D₁₇: 49%; for IDS-SR: 34%). Only the HAM-D₁₇ added significant variance to the model (7%). Assessing sad mood with a single-item mood scale seems to be a straightforward and patient-friendly avenue for life-long mood monitoring. Using a diagnostic interview (e.g., the SCID) in case of a positive screen is warranted. Repeated assessment of the VAMS using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) might reduce false positives.

Abstract = {Response and remission are determined by the proportion of people who fall below a threshold score on depression rating scales. This calculation implies a possibility of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) depending on sensitivity and specificity of the threshold used, but also on response and remission rates. A simulation illustrates the methodological consequences of this phenomenon in a comparative trial where response and remission rates differ between groups: the probability of being misclassified differs between groups, and measures of association (relative risk and odds ratio) are biased. Alternatives are proposed to cope with this misclassification bias. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this research we present a novel approach to the concept change detection problem. Change detection is a fundamental issue with data stream mining as classification models generated need to be updated when significant changes in the underlying data distribution occur. A number of change detection approaches have been proposed but they all suffer from limitations with respect to one or more key performance factors such as high computational complexity, poor sensitivity to gradual change, or the opposite problem of high false positive rate. Our approach uses reservoir sampling to build a sequential change detection model that offers statistically sound guarantees on false positive and false negative rates but has much smaller computational complexity than the ADWIN concept drift detector. Extensive experimentation on a wide variety of datasets reveals that the scheme also has a smaller false detection rate while maintaining a competitive true detection rate to ADWIN.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 82(4) of Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (see record [rid]2014-29889-001[/rid]). The sentence in the 7th paragraph of the Results section “False negatives had significantly lower IPF scores (OR 0.79; 95% CI [0.64, 0.97] per one-unit increase in grand mean score), fewer Cluster C symptoms (OR 0.69; 95% CI [0.62, 0.77]), and a higher number of Cluster D symptoms (OR 1.34; 95% CI [1.14, 1.58]) for lifetime PTSD, compared with true positives and negatives.” should read “False positives had significantly lower IPF scores . . . ”] Objective: Administrative planning and policy decisions frequently rely on diagnostic data extracted from large electronic databases. However, the accuracy of this diagnostic information is uncertain. The present study examined the degree to which various diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic databases were concordant with PTSD diagnostic status determined by standardized diagnostic interview. Method: We interviewed 1,649 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars using the PTSD Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV (SCID). Participants also completed other interview-based and self-report measures of psychopathology and provided consent to access their electronic medical records (EMRs). Results: Concordance between database diagnosis and SCID diagnosis was 72.3% for current PTSD and 79.4% for lifetime PTSD. We observed associations between concordance status and combat exposure, PTSD symptom presentation, comorbid anxiety and depression, and psychosocial impairment. Veterans with false-negative PTSD diagnoses in the EMR were more likely to report lower levels of combat exposure, panic, and PTSD avoidance symptoms. Veterans with false-positive PTSD diagnoses in the EMR were more likely to report treatment seeking for emotional problems and less overall functional impairment. Conclusions: Although the majority of participants were concordant for PTSD status, over 25% of EMR diagnoses differed from those obtained in the diagnostic interview, with varying proportions of false positives and false negatives. Overall, those individuals with the most and least severe symptom presentations in the diagnostic interview were more likely to be accurately classified.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of emotional mood states on the ability to create effective primes using the recently developed false memory priming paradigm. A negative or positive mood state was induced before Deese/Roediger–McDermott (DRM) list presentation. A further control group experienced no mood induction. Participants were then presented with Compound Remote Associate Task (CRAT) problems, half of which had been primed by the previous DRM lists whose critical lure was the solution to the CRAT problem. The results of this study showed that induction of a negative mood state not only impaired recall of critical lures but also diminished their effectiveness as primes for solving CRAT problems. In contrast, for both positive mood and control conditions, the false memory priming advantage was evident, with a higher proportion of primed problems solved in comparison to those not primed. Findings are discussed in relation to the role of affect on semantic activation and the adaptive consequences of false memories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study presents an experiment that explores the patterns of answers to yes–no truth-functional questions in English and Korean. The answering patterns are examined from 12 Korean–English bilingual children and 10 Korean-monolingual children. Four types of sentences in relation to given situations (Wason in Br J Psychol 52:133–142, 1961) were provided as questions such as true affirmative (TA), true negative (TN), false affirmative (FA), and false negative (FN). The bilingual children’s answers were observed in separate language settings, English and Korean. The results by the bilingual in the Korean setting were compared with those by the monolinguals. The results show that bilingual children can process two systems rather successfully by providing correct responses to the given questions. But difficulty patterns, measured from error rates in each setting, are found different in two languages. The bilinguals’ difficulty patterns in English and Korean, however, show deviation from monolinguals’ difficulty patterns suggested in previous studies (Wason in Br J Psychol 52:133–142, 1961, Akiyama in Dev Psychol 20:219–228, 1984, Kim in Dev Psychol 21(3):462–472, 1985, Choi in Dev Psychol 29(3):407–420, 1991). The present work also shows that negatives are not uniformly reported with more errors than affirmatives when the truth condition and the answering system are further involved. All in all, the current study suggests that bilingual children have two separate processing systems for yes–no truth-functional questions. However, the two systems cannot be understood as a simple coexistence of two monolingual systems. Interaction of the two competing linguistic systems is discussed further.

Abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a cognitive and emotional test battery in a representative sample of depressed outpatients to inform likelihood of remission over 8 weeks of treatment with each of three common antidepressant medications. Patients and methods: Outpatients 18–65 years old with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (17 sites) were randomized to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine-XR (extended release). Participants scored ≥ 12 on the baseline 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self-Report and completed 8 weeks of treatment. The baseline test battery measured cognitive and emotional status. Exploratory multivariate logistic regression models predicting remission (16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self-Report score ≤ 5 at 8 weeks) were developed independently for each medication in subgroups stratified by age, sex, or cognitive and emotional test performance. The model with the highest cross-validated accuracy determined the participant proportion in each arm for whom remission could be predicted with an accuracy ≥ 10% above chance. The proportion for whom a prediction could be made with very high certainty (positive predictive value and negative predictive value exceeding 80%) was calculated by incrementally increasing test battery thresholds to predict remission/non-remission. Results: The test battery, individually developed for each medication, improved identification of remitting and non-remitting participants by ≥ 10% beyond chance for 243 of 467 participants. The overall remission rates were escitalopram: 40.8%, sertraline: 30.3%, and venlafaxine-XR: 31.1%. Within this subset for whom prediction exceeded chance, test battery thresholds established a negative predictive value of ≥ 80%, which identified 40.9% of participants not remitting on escitalopram, 77.1% of participants not remitting on sertraline, and 38.7% of participants not remitting on venlafaxine-XR (all including 20% false negatives). Conclusion: The test battery identified about 50% of each medication group as being ≥ 10% more or less likely to remit than by chance, and identified about 38% of individuals who did not remit with ≥ 80% certainty. Clinicians might choose to avoid this specific medication in these particular patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Mortality and impairments were evaluated while identifying and adjusting for Charlson Index comorbidities. Results: Overall prevalence of polyneuropathy was 1.66%, and markedly rose to 6.6% in persons older than 60 years. Cases (n = 2,892) had more comorbidities than controls (n = 14,435) with higher median Charlson Index (6 vs 3, p < 0.001). Diabetes with end-organ disease represented the largest increased comorbidity in cases compared with controls (46.8% vs 6.5%). Diabetic polyneuropathy was the most common specific subtype (38.2%). Miscoded idiopathic cases and false-negative controls also commonly had diabetic polyneuropathy. Median modified Rankin Scale score was considerably higher for cases than controls (4 vs 1, p < 0.001). Multiple comorbidities were found associated with polyneuropathy after adjusting for diabetes co-occurrence, including pulmonary disease, dementia, and others. Polyneuropathy was an independent contributor to multiple functional impairments including difficulty walking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9), climbing stairs (OR = 2.0), using an assistive device (OR = 2.0), fall tendency (OR = 2.4), work disability (OR = 4.2), lower limb amputations (OR = 3.9), and opioid use (OR = 2.7). Prevalent cases had a younger median age at death than controls (80 vs 86 years, p < 0.001), and incident cases had a 6-month shorter survival. Conclusions: Polyneuropathies have notable neurologic impairments beyond their identified multiple comorbidities. Life expectancy is shortened. Diabetic polyneuropathy is underidentified. The quantified extent of the disease burden and refined comorbidity associations emphasize that greater research efforts and health care initiatives are needed.

Abstract = {Background: One of the most commonly administered tools occupational therapists use for stroke patients is the Cognistat, which was designed as a brief screening tool of cognitive functioning. Evaluations in samples of patients have identified a high false‐negative rate if the Cognistat is administered using the ‘screen metric’ approach. Assessing the Cognistat based on its intended design can ensure consistency and accuracy among occupational therapists for this commonly administered tool. Thus, this study examined the accuracy of administering the entire Cognistat in comparison to the screen‐metric approach and the factor analytic structure within stroke patients. Methods: The full Cognistat was administered to stroke patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Results: Seventy‐five patients who experienced a recent stroke met inclusion criteria. An inconsistency between the screen and metric items was found for five of 10 subscales. Additionally, a principal component analysis (PCA) found the Cognistat to be a two factor structure with six of the subscales loading on Factor 1, while the remaining subscales loaded on Factor 2. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that occupational therapists should administer the full Cognistat to stroke patients rather than the original screen‐metric approach. A two‐factor structure was also supported in our results, suggesting that occupational therapists' scoring practices should reflect this finding and use the differentiated score out of 10 rather than a global sum. However, additional research is necessary to consider the clinical and theoretical significance of the Cognistats' subscale clustering. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: This study aimed to validate the SCOFF, an eating disorders (ED) screening questionnaire, in a multiethnic general population sample of adults. Method: A two‐stage design was employed using the South East London Community Health Study phases I and II data. A total of 1,669 participants were screened using the SCOFF in SELCoHI, and 145 were administrated an ED clinical interview in SELCoHII. We explored the diagnostic validity of the questionnaire restricting to the 145 individuals with the clinical questionnaire. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of the SCOFF were 53.7 and 93.5%, respectively. Conclusion: The SCOFF showed good levels of specificity but low sensitivity, resulting in a high percentage of false negatives. Given the low sensitivity found in our sample the SCOFF is likely to be a suboptimal measure for the identification of ED in the community.

Abstract = {Objectives: This study examined whether controlling for educational background in the CERAD cognitive screening battery would affect the likelihood of patients with Parkinson's disease to fulfill criteria for mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI) and dementia (PDD). Materials & Methods: One‐hundred seventeen patients with PD were studied. Cognitive impairment was determined as two subtest scores falling below either the standard cutoff scores or education‐corrected cutoff scores. The presence of dementia was determined by clinical interview or Clinical Dementia Rating. Patients were then classified as PD‐MCI and PDD according to cognitive test performance and presence/absence of dementia. Results: The number of cognitively impaired patients (PD‐MCI or PDD) was significantly higher when education‐controlled cutoff scores were used (62.5% vs 38%). Correspondingly, the number of false negatives (demented PD patients performing normally in CERAD) was significantly lower when education‐corrected cutoff scores were used (4% vs 10%). Conclusions: Controlling for education increases the sensitivity of the CERAD for PD‐MCI and PDD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Introduction: We aimed to field-test the beta version of the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3 beta) diagnostic criteria for classical trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The proposed beta draft of the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11 beta) is almost exclusively based on the ICHD-3 beta classification structure although slightly abbreviated. We compared sensitivity and specificity to ICHD-2 criteria, and evaluated the needs for revision. Methods: Clinical characteristics were systematically and prospectively collected from 206 consecutive TN patients and from 37 consecutive patients with persistent idiopathic facial pain in a cross-sectional study design. Results: The specificity of ICHD-3 beta was similar to ICHD-2 (97.3% vs. 89.2%, p = 0.248) and the sensitivity was unchanged (76.2% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.134). The majority of false-negative diagnoses in TN patients were due to sensory abnormalities at clinical examination. With a proposed modified version of ICHD-3 beta it was possible to increase sensitivity to 96.1% (p < 0.001 compared to ICHD-3 beta) while maintaining specificity at 83.8% (p = 0.074 compared to ICHD-3 beta). Conclusion: ICHD-3 beta was not significantly different from ICHD-2 and both lacked sensitivity. A modification of the criteria improved the sensitivity greatly and is proposed for inclusion in the forthcoming ICHD-3. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Recollection is currently modeled as a univariate retrieval process in which memory probes provoke conscious awareness of contextual details of earlier target presentations. However, that conception cannot explain why some manipulations that increase recollection in recognition experiments suppress false memory in false memory experiments, whereas others increase false memory. Such contrasting effects can be explained if recollection is bivariate—if memory probes can provoke conscious awareness of target items per se, separately from awareness of contextual details, with false memory being suppressed by the former but increased by the latter. Interestingly, these 2 conceptions of recollection have coexisted for some time in different segments of the memory literature. Independent support for the dual-recollection hypothesis is provided by some surprising effects that it predicts, such as release from recollection rejection, false persistence, negative relations between false alarm rates and target remember/know judgments, and recollection without remembering. We implemented the hypothesis in 3 bivariate recollection models, which differ in the degree to which recollection is treated as a discrete or a graded process: a pure multinomial model, a pure signal detection model, and a mixed multinomial/signal detection model. The models were applied to a large corpus of conjoint recognition data, with fits being satisfactory when both recollection processes were present and unsatisfactory when either was deleted. Factor analyses of the models’ parameter spaces showed that target and context recollection never loaded on a common factor, and the 3 models converged on the same process loci for the effects of important experimental manipulations. Thus, a variety of results were consistent with bivariate recollection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The goal of the current study was to develop and pilot the utility of two simple internal response bias metrics, over-reporting and under-reporting, in terms of additive clinical value within common screening practices for early detection of autism spectrum disorder risk. Participants were caregivers and children under 36 months of age (n = 145) participating in first-time diagnostic appointments across our clinical research center due to developmental concerns. Caregivers were asked to complete the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (MCHAT) as well as a questionnaire embedding six response bias indicator questions. These questions were items that in previous clinical studies had been endorsed by an overwhelming majority of parents within clinically identified populations. Results indicated that removal of self-reports indicative of potential response bias dramatically reduced both false positives and false negatives on the MCHAT within this sample. This suggests that future work developing internal metrics of response bias may be promising in addressing limits of current screening measures and practices.

Abstract = {This letter discusses a problem with the relationship between autism spectrum disorder, catatonia and schizophrenia in DSM-5. A case of autism spectrum disorder with an onset between 12 and 24 months of age is easy to differentiate from a positive symptom-predominant case of schizophrenia with onset at 25 years and good premorbid function. The DSM-5 criteria can clearly differentiate two such cases. However, it is difficult, based on the DSM-5 criteria, to differentiate autism spectrum disorder from a childhood-onset, negative symptom catatonia case of schizophrenia that has not yet developed delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech. DSM-5 schizophrenia can be diagnosed with only two symptoms; these can be catatonia or negative symptoms plus one of: delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech. This diagnostic problem could potentially result in two errors: false positive diagnoses of autism, and false negative diagnoses of catatonia. The relationship may be so close that a subset of cases of autism, catatonia and psychosis are indistinguishable, especially in childhood cases in which delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech have not yet appeared. This problem should be addressed in future research and in future editions of the DSM manual. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: Some individuals will not meet criteria for a lifetime alcohol use disorder (AUD) at a baseline assessment but will at a follow-up measurement, but not because the disorder began after the initial evaluation. Despite several research implications, this type of unreliability of lifetime AUD estimates has not been studied extensively. The present study investigated the extent of false negatives in the assessment of lifetime AUDs using longitudinal data. Method: A prospective cohort of college freshmen (baseline N = 489) were assessed seven times between ages 18 and 34 years using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Individuals were categorized as false negatives at the index assessment using a retrospective (using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition [DSM-III], and DSM-IV data), a prospective (using DSM-III data only), and a combined approach (using DSM-III data only). Results: For DSM-IV, of the 29 ostensible new onsets at a follow-up 5 years later (age approximately 34 years), 28 (96%) reported meeting AUD criteria before the index assessment (age approximately 29 years). For DSM-III, of the 25 ostensible new onsets, the retrospective, prospective, and combined approaches categorized 18 (72%) individuals as false negatives at the index assessment. Conclusions: These findings further demonstrate sensitivity issues with lifetime AUD assessments and call into question the validity of “onset” cases that rely on only two waves of data, especially when the follow-up assessment fails to reassess lifetime fully (i.e., across the entire drinking history).

Abstract = {Hot spot identification (HSID) aims to identify potential sites—roadway segments, intersections, crosswalks, interchanges, ramps, etc.—with disproportionately high crash risk relative to similar sites. An inefficient HSID methodology might result in either identifying a safe site as high risk (false positive) or a high risk site as safe (false negative), and consequently lead to the misuse the available public funds, to poor investment decisions, and to inefficient risk management practice. Current HSID methods suffer from issues like underreporting of minor injury and property damage only (PDO) crashes, challenges of accounting for crash severity into the methodology, and selection of a proper safety performance function to model crash data that is often heavily skewed by a preponderance of zeros. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a combination of a PDO equivalency calculation and quantile regression technique to identify hot spots in a transportation network. In particular, issues related to underreporting and crash severity are tackled by incorporating equivalent PDO crashes, whilst the concerns related to the non-count nature of equivalent PDO crashes and the skewness of crash data are addressed by the non-parametric quantile regression technique. The proposed method identifies covariate effects on various quantiles of a population, rather than the population mean like most methods in practice, which more closely corresponds with how black spots are identified in practice. The proposed methodology is illustrated using rural road segment data from Korea and compared against the traditional EB method with negative binomial regression. Application of a quantile regression model on equivalent PDO crashes enables identification of a set of high-risk sites that reflect the true safety costs to the society, simultaneously reduces the influence of under-reported PDO and minor injury crashes, and overcomes the limitation of traditional NB model in dealing with preponderance of zeros problem or right skewed dataset.

Abstract = {Research has shown that emotional events are remembered better than neutral events, but might also elicit an increase in false memories. The present study was designed to disentangle the influences of valence and arousal on event memory in the misinformation paradigm. Participants were shown six types of photographs (positive with high/low arousal, negative with high/low arousal, ambiguous, neutral), after which half of them were exposed to misleading information. A recognition test assessed memory for both correct and false central and peripheral details. Negative and ambiguous events elicited fewer correct and more false memories for peripheral details than positive and neutral events, regardless of previous exposure to misinformation. Arousal improved memory for correct central details, and both negative valence and arousal inhibited control participants’ tendency to endorse false central details. The power of emotion was overruled by the power of suggestion, however, as the latter effect disappeared with previous exposure to misinformation. Results are discussed in the light of earlier research on emotion and cognition, recent motivational theories, and implications for forensic practice.

Abstract = {Background and objectives: People who experience auditory hallucinations tend to show weak reality discrimination skills, so that they misattribute internal, self-generated events to an external, non-self source. We examined whether inducing negative affect in healthy young adults would increase their tendency to make external misattributions on a reality discrimination task. Methods: Participants (N = 54) received one of three mood inductions (one positive, two negative) and then performed an auditory signal detection task to assess reality discrimination. Results: Participants who received either of the two negative inductions made more false alarms, but not more hits, than participants who received the neutral induction, indicating that negative affect makes participants more likely to misattribute internal, self-generated events to an external, non-self source. Limitations: These findings are drawn from an analogue sample, and research that examines whether negative affect also impairs reality discrimination in patients who experience auditory hallucinations is required. Conclusions: These findings show that negative affect disrupts reality discrimination and suggest one way in which negative affect may lead to hallucinatory experiences.

Abstract = {Objective: In this paper we present an evaluation of the role of reliability indicators in glaucoma severity prediction. In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to extract useful information from tests that would be normally discarded because they are considered unreliable. Methods: We set up a predictive modelling framework to predict glaucoma severity from visual field (VF) tests sensitivities in different reliability scenarios. Three quality indicators were considered in this study: false positives rate, false negatives rate and fixation losses. Glaucoma severity was evaluated by considering a 3-levels version of the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study scoring metric. A bootstrapping and class balancing technique was designed to overcome problems related to small sample size and unbalanced classes. As a classification model we selected Naïve Bayes. We also evaluated Bayesian networks to understand the relationships between the different anatomical sectors on the VF map. Results: The methods were tested on a data set of 28,778 VF tests collected at Moorfields Eye Hospital between 1986 and 2010. Applying Friedman test followed by the post hoc Tukey’s honestly significant difference test, we observed that the classifiers trained on any kind of test, regardless of its reliability, showed comparable performance with respect to the classifier trained only considering totally reliable tests (p-value > 0.01). Moreover, we showed that different quality indicators gave different effects on prediction results. Training classifiers using tests that exceeded the fixation losses threshold did not have a deteriorating impact on classification results (p-value > 0.01). On the contrary, using only tests that fail to comply with the constraint on false negatives significantly decreased the accuracy of the results (p-value < 0.01). Meaningful patterns related to glaucoma evolution were also extracted. Conclusions: Results showed that classification modelling is not negatively affected by the inclusion of less reliable tests in the training process. This means that less reliable tests do not subtract useful information from a model trained using only completely reliable data. Future work will be devoted to exploring new quantitative thresholds to ensure high quality testing and low re-test rates. This could assist doctors in tuning patient follow-up and therapeutic plans, possibly slowing down disease progression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: When psychosis first presents, and particularly in the case of schizophrenia, the guidelines recommend rapid institution of treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Two different clinical pictures can be observed: psychoses with acute onset and those with insidious onset. Acute cases (60% of the total) have a favourable course in 85% of young patients but where onset is insidious and the symptoms are predominantly negative, the course is poor in 25% of subjects. Since acute symptoms are relatively easy to diagnose, it is diagnosis of the “insidious/negative” cases that represents a major challenge. Is such a diagnosis possible yet? How can we limit the number of false negatives and false positives with the attendant risk of stigma? What treatment should be administered? Methods: Review of the literature (PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO) and comparison with clinical practice here. Results: Young people with a high risk of developing psychosis can be identified using scales such as SOPS (Scale of Prodromal Symptoms), PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation) or from the presence of neuroanatomical and genetic characteristics. Unfortunately, these tools are more specific for positive symptoms, and therefore identify a sub-population of young people at risk: those at Ultra-High Risk (UHR). It can be argued that effective treatment is available for these UHR young people to prevent the condition from developing into schizophrenia. On the other hand, the problem persists for young people presenting an insidious onset and predominantly negative symptoms: to date we have no real way of either screening them or assessing the efficacy of a treatment. Conclusion: “Ultra-High Risk” patients are starting to represent a separate nosological entity. This entity is made up of young patients, most of whom have positive symptoms. If left untreated, the course will lead to seriously compromised social and psychological functioning. Rapid diagnosis and treatment for UHRs is therefore essential. In the future we need to refine our diagnostic tools to make them sufficiently specific and sensitive but also so that the widest category of “Risk Syndrome for Psychosis” includes young patients with mostly negative symptoms.

Abstract = {The Movement Disorders Society (MDS) formulated diagnostic criteria and assessment guidelines for the screening of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). We carried out a validation of the cognitive measures suggested in the screening algorithm (i.e. the Mini Mental State Examination – MMSE – total score, serial 7s subtraction, 3-word recall, pentagons copy, and one minute letter fluency) in 86 patients with PD. Thirty-six percent of participants were diagnosed with dementia using the MDS algorithm, but with the Dementia Rating Scale instead of the MMSE. The original MDS procedure misclassified 11 patients (12.8%) as false negatives and 3 (3.5%) as false positives, leading to 65% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The main reason for misdiagnoses was insensitivity of the MMSE total score. Three attempts were made to reach a better screening performance, which warrants high sensitivity more than high specificity: 1. exclusion of the MMSE total score as a diagnostic requirement; 2. determination of a better cut off through Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis; 3. replacement of the MMSE with the equally undemanding, but more PD-specific, Mini Mental Parkinson. The first two strategies generally yielded high sensitivity, but poor specificity. The best outcome was achieved using a Mini Mental Parkinson total score <27 as cognitive criterion: sensitivity was 87% and negative predictive value was 90%; however, specificity was only 67%. Our findings seem to suggest that MDS practical guidelines are specific, but might benefit from the use of more PD-oriented tools than the MMSE in terms of sensitivity.

Abstract = {Recent research has shown that individuals vary in the extent to which they weight positive versus negative information during attitude generalization, i.e., their valence weighting bias (Pietri, Fazio, & Shook, 2013). As of yet, little is known about the conditions under which such valence weighting is likely to affect behavior and the consequences of that behavior. Experiments 1 and 2 tested the idea that the relative weight individuals give to positives versus negatives may influence their formation of an initial evaluative response, which will serve as a default provided that they do not have the motivation and opportunity to deliberate further. When opportunity was restricted by the requirement to respond quickly, participants showed greater correspondence between their weighting bias and their approach–avoidance behavior toward objects in a novel environment (Experiment 1). When an experimental manipulation motivated them to mistrust their initial responses, participants showed less correspondence between their weighting bias and risk-taking behavior than when they were motivated to trust their initial responses (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 investigated the downstream consequences of this valence weighting bias for attitude maintenance versus change. Those with a more negative weighting bias gave greater weight to negative information that was actually false, avoided testing the associated stimuli, and hence did not discover their true value. Those with a more positive weighting bias gave less weight to the negative information, tested the associated stimuli more fully, and overcame the false negative information. Implications for exploration, attitude maintenance, and prejudice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The feeling of being the source and controller of one's actions and their effects in the outside world is an important aspect of our sense of self. Disturbances in this sense of agency (SoA) were observed in schizophrenia and have been linked to impairments in sensorimotor integration. We used a virtual-world action-monitoring paradigm to investigate the SoA in 20 schizophrenic patients and 18 healthy subjects. Participants continuously moved a virtual pen displayed on a computer screen using a touchpad device. The control they exceeded over the virtual pen was switched periodically between the participant and the computer. Participants were requested to monitor their actions and the effects on the virtual pen, and indicate loss or regain of control over the pen's movement by button presses. The numbers of erroneous external attribution of action effects (false negative agency judgements) and erroneous self-attribution (false positive agency judgements) were not significantly different in patients and healthy subjects. However, patients showed a significant increase in the duration of false negative agency judgements. Moreover, the number of false negative agency judgements as well as the number and the duration of false positive agency judgements were negatively correlated with the performance in cognitive tests (BACS) in the patient group only. Our findings indicate that the evaluation system to detect a mismatch between actions and their effects in the outside world is probably more rigid in schizophrenic patients, which leads to an increased self-attribution bias for action effects, as commonly found in delusions of control. The impairment in sensorimotor integration may be compensated for by stronger cognitive control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: This study aimed to: (1) estimate the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among haematological cancer patients attending treatment centres; and (2) explore the demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with anxiety and/or depression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with outpatients from three haematology clinics in Australia. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of haematological cancer were approached by a research assistant while waiting for their appointment and invited to participate in the survey. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and self-reported demographic, disease and treatment characteristics. Results: Questionnaires from 304 participants were returned. Twenty-seven percent of patients reported anxiety and 17% reported depression. Specifically, 15% reported anxiety without depression, 5% reported depression without anxiety, and 12% reported comorbid anxiety and depression. Participants who had to relocate to receive treatment had almost three times the odds of reporting anxiety and/or depression compared to those who did not have to move. Former smokers also had significantly higher odds of reporting anxiety and/or depression. Limitations: The HADS is likely to have produced some false positives and false negatives when compared with gold standard structured clinical interviews for assessing psychological morbidity. Conclusions: Approximately 20% of haematological cancer patients attending outpatient clinics may experience clinically significant levels of anxiety and/or depression. Providing additional tailored support to patients who have had to relocate for treatment, and to former smokers, may help to reduce anxiety and depression among these subgroups.

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the workhorse of imaging-based human cognitive neuroscience. The use of fMRI is ever-increasing; within the last 4 years more fMRI studies have been published than in the previous 17 years. This large body of research has mainly focused on the functional localization of condition- or stimulus-dependent changes in the blood-oxygenation-level dependent signal. In recent years, however, many aspects of the commonly practiced analysis frameworks and methodologies have been critically reassessed. Here we summarize these critiques, providing an overview of the major conceptual and practical deficiencies in widely used brain-mapping approaches, and exemplify some of these issues by the use of imaging data and simulations. In particular, we discuss the inherent pitfalls and shortcomings of methodologies for statistical parametric mapping. Our critique emphasizes recent reports of excessively high numbers of both false positive and false negative findings in fMRI brain mapping. We outline our view regarding the broader scientific implications of these methodological considerations and briefly discuss possible solutions.

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the cognitive skills that underlie children’s susceptibility to semantic and phonological false memories in the Deese/Roediger–McDermott procedure (Deese, 1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). In Experiment 1, performance on the Verbal Similarities subtest of the British Ability Scales (BAS) II (Elliott, Smith, & McCulloch, 1997) predicted correct and false recall of semantic lures. In Experiment 2, performance on the Yopp–Singer Test of Phonemic Segmentation (Yopp, 1988) did not predict correct recall, but inversely predicted the false recall of phonological lures. Auditory short-term memory was a negative predictor of false recall in Experiment 1, but not in Experiment 2. The findings are discussed in terms of the formation of gist and verbatim traces as proposed by fuzzy trace theory (Reyna & Brainerd, 1998) and the increasing automaticity of associations as proposed by associative activation theory (Howe, Wimmer, Gagnon, & Plumpton, 2009).

Abstract = {Functional magnetic reasonance imaging (fMRI) plays an important role in pre-surgical planning for patients with resectable brain lesions such as tumors. With appropriately designed tasks, the results of fMRI studies can guide resection, thereby preserving vital brain tissue. The mass univariate approach to fMRI data analysis consists of performing a statistical test in each voxel, which is used to classify voxels as either active or inactive—that is, related, or not, to the task of interest. In cognitive neuroscience, the focus is on controlling the rate of false positives while accounting for the severe multiple testing problem of searching the brain for activations. However, stringent control of false positives is accompanied by a risk of false negatives, which can be detrimental, particularly in clinical settings where false negatives may lead to surgical resection of vital brain tissue. Consequently, for clinical applications, we argue for a testing procedure with a stronger focus on preventing false negatives. We present a thresholding procedure that incorporates information on false positives and false negatives. We combine two measures of significance for each voxel: a classical p-value, which reflects evidence against the null hypothesis of no activation, and an alternative p-value, which reflects evidence against activation of a prespecified size. This results in a layered statistical map for the brain. One layer marks voxels exhibiting strong evidence against the traditional null hypothesis, while a second layer marks voxels where activation cannot be confidently excluded. The third layer marks voxels where the presence of activation can be rejected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Although there is an extensive literature on the effects of depression and dysphoria on memory accuracy, few studies have examined the effects of depression or dysphoria on false memory. This study used the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (Roediger and McDermott in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 21:803–814, 1995) to look for evidence of a mood congruent false memory effect in dysphoric individuals. Participants studied lists of semantically associated negative and neutral words for a recognition memory test. The memory test included critical lures (words not presented in the study lists, but strongly related to words on the lists) to assess false memory and non-presented negative and neutral unrelated words to assess participants’ response bias. Although dysphoric participants falsely recognized significantly more critical lures related to the negative word lists, additional analyses revealed that this difference could be explained by a response bias that inflated their recognition responses to negatively valenced words. Directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and other degenerative parkinsonian syndromes is important for management and prognostic purposes. Diagnosis can be challenging in early disease and in atypical cases. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the application of dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) in degenerative parkinsonism and related disorders as a diagnostic tool. Results: The use of DAT-SPECT shows some utility in the early diagnosis of PD and differentiation from other non-degenerative parkinsonian disorders (i.e. essential tremor, dystonic tremor, drug-induced and in most cases of psychogenic parkinsonism), since it can accurately detect the presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. The test has been shown to have high sensitivity/specificity by multiple studies. DAT imaging may also have some prognostic value for disease progression. However, it has limited value in differentiating among degenerative causes of parkinsonism. DAT imaging has some limitations. In most studies, true test accuracy is unknown since the gold standard is clinical diagnosis by a movement disorders neurologist. Therefore, the sensitivity of the test cannot exceed that of the clinical diagnosis. In addition, false negative scans occur and highlight the need for clinical follow-up. Conclusion: Clinical assessment remains the most important aspect in evaluating these patients. DAT-SPECT is a sensitive modality to detect nigrostriatal degeneration. In spite of increasing data using this technique, however, more long-term clinical studies are required to determine how DAT-SPECT scan can guide decision-making.

Abstract = {When importing screening questionnaires of ASD, it has been found that parental interpretation/reporting of autistic traits may be culturally influenced. In the current study, our aim was preliminary evaluation of the Finnish parent rated SRS in order to determine whether the measure would show promise as an aid in screening. The study sample consisted of high-functioning school aged male ASD outpatients of Oulu University Hospital (n = 44, age 11.4 ± 2.3) and age-matched controls (n = 44, age 11.8 ± 2.4 years). Internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminative validity was in line with previous research. However, the results indicated that the cut-off published in the SRS manual might be too high to be used in Finland. Our results emphasize the importance of determining the normative range and clinical cut-offs in various cultures when importing diagnostic screening questionnaires in order to avoid getting high percentages of false negatives in the screening phase, and thus risk leaving many children without adequate diagnostic evaluation and rehabilitation.

Abstract = {Software testing is a crucial task during software development process with the potential to save time and budget by recognizing defects as early as possible and delivering a more defect-free product. To improve the testing process, fault prediction approaches identify parts of the system that are more defect prone. However, when the defect data or quality-based class labels are not identified or the company does not have similar or earlier versions of the software project, researchers cannot use supervised classification methods for defect detection. In order to detect defect proneness of modules in software projects with high accuracy and improve detection model generalization ability, we propose an automated software fault detection model using semi-supervised hybrid self-organizing map (HySOM). HySOM is a semi-supervised model based on self-organizing map and artificial neural network. The advantage of HySOM is the ability to predict the label of the modules in a semi-supervised manner using software measurement threshold values in the absence of quality data. In semi-supervised HySOM, the role of expert for identifying fault prone modules becomes less critical and more supportive. We have benchmarked the proposed model with eight industrial data sets from NASA and Turkish white-goods embedded controller software. The results show improvement in false negative rate and overall error rate in 80% and 60% of the cases respectively for NASA data sets. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the proposed model with other recent proposed methods. According to the results, our semi-supervised model can be used as an automated tool to guide testing effort by prioritizing the module’s defects improving the quality of software development and software testing in less time and budget.

Abstract = {Purpose: The goal of the study was to determine to what extent 3 proposed markers of language impairment (LI) in English (verb tense, nonword repetition, and sentence repetition) accurately distinguish affected and unaffected English-speaking individuals. Method: Electronic databases were searched for diagnostic accuracy studies involving the 3 markers. Quality of relevant studies was described. Numbers of true and false positives and negatives were extracted and used to calculate likelihood ratios (LRs). Results: Thirteen studies met the selection criteria. The majority were based on clinically ascertained samples. Pooled LRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for tense (LR+) and sentence repetition (LR+ and LR−) were suggestive of presence (LR+) or absence (LR−) of LI. Wide CIs around the value of inconsistency I² index reduced reliability of pooled values for sentence repetition. High between-study heterogeneity precluded pooling of LR values for tense (LR−) and nonword repetition (LR+ and LR−). Conclusion: The limited evidence available suggests that the proposed markers may be at best suggestive of LI in English. Future research may refine existing marker tasks to increase their accuracy and test the most promising tasks in unselected samples of participants with and without LI.

Abstract = {Background: There is a dearth of information on suicidal thoughts and acts or other acts of deliberate self‐harm by offenders under community supervision. Aims: The objective of this study is to estimate lifetime and one month prevalence of deliberate self‐harm and to determine ongoing risk among offenders in the community under probation supervision. Methods: One hundred and seventy‐three randomly selected offenders under supervision by the probation service in one county in England were screened for mental illness. All 88 screened cases and a one‐in‐five sample of non‐cases were interviewed according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory Module‐B. False negatives (n = 17) were used to weight calculations and estimate prevalence for the whole group. Results: A third of the interviewed sample (n = 56) had a lifetime history of suicide attempts, and 9 (5%) had self‐harmed in the month prior to interview. Lifetime suicide history was associated with suicidal ideation and deliberate self‐harm in the prior month. Conclusions and implications: Our adjusted findings indicate that 25‐40% of offenders serving all or part of their sentence in the community have a lifetime history of self‐harm, which is similar to the rate among prisoners, and are at very much higher risk of further such acts or completed suicide than the general population. At a time of change in delivery of probation services the implications are that (i) rates of suicide and other forms of deliberate self‐harm should be continually assessed in all probation areas, particularly with reference to service changes; (ii) the relationship between deliberate acts of self‐harm, suicidal ideation and completion of suicide should be investigated prospectively in larger studies; (iii) probation services are likely to need mental health expertise to manage these risks.

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The PRIME screen is a self-administered questionnaire designed to quickly assess individuals at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. It is shorter in both length and administration time compared to the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS)—a standard instrument for psychosis prodromal risk assessment. Validation of the PRIME against the SIPS has not been reported in large non-clinical populations. METHODS: A culturally modified version of the PRIME screen (mPRIME) was administered to Kenyan youth between the ages of 14 and 29. 182 completed both the SIPS and mPRIME. Validation measures (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) were calculated and the study sample was then broken down into true positives, false positives, and false negatives for comparison on different quantitative measures. RESULTS: Using previously suggested thresholds for a positive screen, the mPRIME had a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 64.8% for our entire sample. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 12.3% and 89.7%, respectively. Breaking the sample down by questionnaire outcome showed that true-positive individuals scored higher on average rate and intensity of endorsement of mPRIME items compared to false-positive and false-negatives, while false-negatives on average registered disagreement on all mPRIME questionnaire items. CONCLUSIONS: The mPRIME does not appear to be an effective screener of at-risk individuals for psychosis in our non-clinical sample. Further validation efforts in other general populations are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Results of meta-analyses are regarded as the highest level of evidence. A statistically non-significant effect size from a meta-analysis is typically considered true negative even in the presence of a statistically significant signal in individual studies, presumed to be false positive. Here we provide examples from neuroimaging, genetics and psychopharmacology of why meta-analyses may frequently yield false negative results from true positive findings. This may happen in situations when individual studies report findings in opposing directions, the sum of which yields a non-significant overall effect size. Such non-significant meta-analyses, which show statistical heterogeneity and include studies with opposing effect sizes do not provide an accurate estimate of the overall effect and may have lower heuristic value than individual studies. Over reliance on such meta-analyses may falsely identify certain potentially fruitful research avenues as blind alleys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: This study examines the data from single loop detectors on northbound (NB) US-101 in San Jose, California to estimate real-time crash risk assessment models. Method: The classification tree and neural network based crash risk assessment models developed with data from NB US-101 are applied to data from the same freeway, as well as to the data from nearby segments of the SB US-101, NB I-880, and SB I-880 corridors. The performance of crash risk assessment models on these nearby segments is the focus of this research. Results: The model applications show that it is in fact possible to use the same model for multiple freeways, as the underlying relationships between traffic data and crash risk remain similar. Impact on Industry: The framework provided here may be helpful to authorities for freeway segments with newly installed traffic surveillance apparatuses, since the real-time crash risk assessment models from nearby freeways with existing infrastructure would be able to provide a reasonable estimate of crash risk. The robustness of the model output is also assessed by location, time of day, and day of week. The analysis shows that on some locations the models may require further learning due to higher than expected false positive (e.g., the I-680/I-280 interchange on US-101 NB) or false negative rates. The approach for post-processing the results from the model provides ideas to refine the model prior to or during the implementation.(e.g., the I-680/I-280 interchange on US-101 NB) or false negative rates (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Correlational research has demonstrated links between prospective memory and checking compulsions. These findings suggest that negative beliefs and diminished confidence in prospective memory may contribute to intrusive doubts that tasks were not completed and ultimately to checking behavior. The present study represents the first experimental test of the hypothesis that diminished confidence in prospective memory causes increased doubt and urges to check. Methods: Participants completed several tests and questionnaires assessing prospective memory. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either false positive or false negative feedback about their prospective memory. They subsequently completed additional prospective memory tests and their doubts and urges to check that each of those tests was properly performed were assessed. Results: Participants who received false negative feedback about their prospective memory reported significantly higher levels of doubt and urges to check compared to those who received false positive feedback. Limitations: A non-clinical sample was used and participants with severe levels of depression and anxiety were excused before the feedback phase to avoid causing them further distress. Conclusions: The results provide further support for memory confidence models of checking compulsions by indicating that diminished confidence in prospective memory can cause increased doubt and urges to check.

Abstract = {Objective: Describe characteristics of small strokes causing acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). Methods: Ambispective cross-sectional study of patients with AVS (acute vertigo or dizziness, nystagmus, nausea/vomiting, head-motion intolerance, unsteady gait) with at least one stroke risk factor from 1999 to 2011 at a single stroke referral center. Patients underwent nonquantitative HINTS “plus” examination (head impulse, nystagmus, test-of-skew plus hearing), neuroimaging to confirm diagnoses (97% by MRI), and repeat MRI in those with initially normal imaging but clinical signs of a central lesion. We identified patients with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) strokes ≤ 10 mm in axial diameter. Results: Of 190 high-risk AVS presentations (105 strokes), we found small strokes in 15 patients (median age 64 years, range 41–85). The most common vestibular structure infarcted was the inferior cerebellar peduncle (73%); the most common stroke location was the lateral medulla (60%). Focal neurologic signs were present in only 27%. The HINTS “plus” battery identified small strokes with greater sensitivity than early MRI-DWI (100% vs 47%, p < 0.001). False-negative initial MRIs (6–48 hours) were more common with small strokes than large strokes (53% [n = 8/15] vs 7.8% [n = 7/90], p < 0.001). Nonlacunar stroke mechanisms were responsible in 47%, including 6 vertebral artery occlusions or dissections. Conclusions: Small strokes affecting central vestibular projections can present with isolated AVS. The HINTS “plus” hearing battery identifies these patients with greater accuracy than early MRI-DWI, which is falsely negative in half, up to 48 hours after onset. We found nonlacunar mechanisms in half, suggesting greater risk than might otherwise be assumed for patients with such small infarctions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aims and objectives. (1) To describe the results of a web‐based teaching module used by registered nurses to identify patients at risk of aspiration and (2) to determine accuracy of the registered nurse‐administered 3‐ounce water swallow challenge protocol, that is, drinking three ounces of water, a basic cognitive screen and oral mechanism evaluation, when compared with blinded ratings from speech‐language pathology. Background. Early identification of potential swallowing problems is important prior to ingestion of food, fluid and medications. Unfortunately, current nurse‐administered screens use a variety of non‐evidence‐based assessments. It would be beneficial to use a valid, reliable and evidence‐based screen, that is, the Yale swallow protocol. Design. Prospective, blinded, referral‐based. Methods. Fifty‐two registered nurses and 101 inpatients participated. First, each participant was administered the 3‐ounce water swallow challenge protocol by a speech‐language pathologist. Second, a nurse administered the protocol to the same patient within one hour and independently recorded results and diet recommendations. The nurse was blinded to the study's purpose and results of the speech‐language pathologist's initial screening. Out of view, but simultaneous with the nurse‐administered protocol, a speech‐language pathologist rerated the patient's challenge for comparison with initial results and determined the accuracy of the nurse‐administered protocol. Results. Intra‐ and inter‐rater protocol agreements for the two speech‐language pathologists were 100%. Inter‐rater protocol agreement between registered nurses and speech‐language pathologists was 98·01%. Conclusions. Results confirm the reliability and accuracy of a registered nurse–administered Yale swallow protocol. The consequence of 98% accuracy combined with previously reported 96·5% sensitivity, 97·9% negative predictive value and <2% false negative rate allowed for adoption of the protocol for the entire general hospital population. Relevance to clinical practice. Avoidance of preventable prandial pulmonary aspiration as a cause of nosocomial infection is an important goal for all acute care hospitalised patients deemed at risk of aspiration.

Abstract = {Labeled graphs are widely used to model complex data in many domains, so subgraph querying has been attracting more and more attention from researchers around the world. Unfortunately, subgraph querying is very time consuming since it involves subgraph isomorphism testing that is known to be an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose a novel coding method for subgraph querying that is based on Laplacian spectrum and the number of walks. Our method follows the filtering-and-verification framework and works well on graph databases with frequent updates. We also propose novel two-step filtering conditions that can filter out most false positives and prove that the two-step filtering conditions satisfy the no-false-negative requirement (no dismissal in answers). Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic graphs show that, compared with six existing counterpart methods, our method can effectively improve the efficiency of subgraph querying.

Abstract = {Familial searching is the process of searching in a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) database for relatives of a certain individual. Typically, this individual is the source of a crime stain that can be reasonably attributed to the offender. If this crime stain has not given rise to a match in a DNA database, then in some jurisdictions a familial search may be carried out to attempt to identify a relative of the offender, thus giving investigators a lead. We discuss two methods to select a subset from the database that contains a relative (if present) with a probability that we can control. The first method is based on a derivation of the likelihood ratio for each database member in favour of being the relative, taking all DNA profiles in the database into account. This method needs prior probabilities and yields posterior probabilities. The second method is based on case‐specific false positive and false negative rates. We discuss the relationship between the approaches and assess the methods with familial searching carried out in the Dutch national DNA database. We also give practical recommendations on the usefulness of both methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

This two-part editorial (Part I focuses on epilepsy and Part II focuses on bipolar disorder) was written with the hope of convincing the reader that the neuropsychopharmacology literature is contaminated by a systematic denial and underestimation of inducer effects. (1) It usually occurs first in the AED literature and then is repeated in the literature on bipolar disorder (Part II). (2) Part I demonstrated that this denial cuts across pharmacological mechanisms including CYP3A4 and nonmetabolized drugs and is more evident in the case of mild-inducer AEDs. Part II will demonstrate that in bipolar disorder, this denial also cuts across pharmacological mechanisms including CYP3A4 and nonmetabolized drugs and is more evident in the case of mildinducer AEDs.

Abstract = {The ongoing discussion among scientists about null-hypothesis significance testing and Bayesian data analysis has led to speculation about the practices and consequences of “researcher degrees of freedom.” This article advances this debate by asking the broader questions that we, as scientists, should be asking: How do scientists make decisions in the course of doing research, and what is the impact of these decisions on scientific conclusions? We asked practicing scientists to collect data in a simulated research environment, and our findings show that some scientists use data collection heuristics that deviate from prescribed methodology. Monte Carlo simulations show that data collection heuristics based on p values lead to biases in estimated effect sizes and Bayes factors and to increases in both false-positive and false-negative rates, depending on the specific heuristic. We also show that using Bayesian data collection methods does not eliminate these biases. Thus, our study highlights the little appreciated fact that the process of doing science is a behavioral endeavor that can bias statistical description and inference in a manner that transcends adherence to any particular statistical framework.

Abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a tremendously promising tool for imaging tissue microstructure, and for inferring large scale structural connectivity in vivo. However, the sensitivity of the technique is highly dependent on methodological details. Acquisition parameters, pre-processing steps, reconstruction models, and statistical analysis all affect the final sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a study. In the case of fiber pathway reconstruction in the central nervous system, termed tractography, false positive and false negative results abound, and interpretation of results must take into account the potential shortcomings of the techniques used. This article will review the strengths and limitations of different types of diffusion MRI tractography analysis, and highlight what one can realistically hope to learn from such imaging studies of the human brain.

Abstract = {The Social Security Administration (SSA) provides financial support to adults disabled by psychiatric conditions to provide for their basic needs. For beneficiaries identified as incapable of managing their funds, representative payee assignment is mandated. However, studies indicate that the current SSA method of determining capability leads to idiosyncratic payee assignment, with a tendency to under-identify beneficiaries needing payees. Over two phases with data from 78 mental health clinicians treating 134 patient-beneficiaries, we describe the development of a new assessment, the Clinician Assessment of Financial Incapability (CAFI). Item generation, subscale construction, and preliminary assessments of validity are described. We also describe the simultaneous development of a criterion measure of capability, a comprehensive review of all data. Experts identified four subscales mapping to four criteria of incapability; factor analysis provided support for this item structure. Close to one-half of patients were determined to be incapable by review of all data. CAFI and SSA methods correctly classified 73% of cases, but errors with CAFI were more evenly distributed between false negatives and false positives. The implications of classification error are considered, and advantages of CAFI over the SSA method are enumerated. Plans for future instrument revision are briefly described.

Abstract = {Signal detection theory (SDT) was developed to analyze the behavior of a single judge but also can be used to analyze decisions made by organizations or other social systems. SDT quantifies the ability to distinguish between signal and noise by separating accuracy of the detection system from response bias—the propensity to over-warn (too many false positives) or under-warn (too many misses). We apply SDT techniques to national and state-level data sets to analyze the ability of the child welfare services systems to detect instances of child maltreatment. Blacks have higher rates of referral and the system is less accurate for them than for Whites or Hispanics. The incidence of false positives—referrals leading to unsubstantiated findings—is higher for Blacks than for other groups, as is the incidence of false negatives—children for whom no referral was made but who are in fact neglected or abused. The rate of true positives–children for whom a referral was made and for whom the allegation was substantiated–is higher for Blacks. Values of d′ (signal strength) are roughly the same for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics but there are pronounced group differences in C (a measure of the location of the decision threshold). Analyses show that the child welfare services system treats Blacks differently from Hispanics and Whites in ways that cannot be justified readily in terms of objective measures of group differences. This study illustrates the potential for JDM techniques such as SDT to contribute to understanding of system-level decision making processes.

Abstract = {Aims: Controversies remain about the validity of the diagnosis of problematic Internet use. This might be due in part to the lack of longitudinal naturalistic studies that have followed a cohort of patients who self-identify as having Internet-related problems. Methods: This retrospective study included 57 patients who consulted the Geneva Addiction Outpatient Clinic from January 1, 2007, to January 1, 2010. Patients underwent an initial clinical psychiatric evaluation that included collection of data on socio-demographics, method of referral, specific Internet usage, psychiatric diagnosis, and Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) scores. Treatment consisted of individual psychotherapeutic sessions. Results: Of these patients, 98% were male and 37% were 18 years or younger. Most patients were online gamers (46% playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games). The mean IAT score was 52.9 (range 20–90). Sixty-eight percent of patients had a co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis, with social phobia being the most prevalent (17.8%). Patients who remained in treatment (dropout rate 24%) showed an overall improvement of symptoms: 38.6% showed significant or average improvement on their CGI score, 26.3% showed minimal improvement, and 14% showed no change. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that there are specific types of Internet use, with online gaming mainly affecting young male patients. As Internet addiction is not yet an official diagnosis, better instruments are needed to screen patients and to avoid false-negative and false-positive diagnoses. Successful care should integrate the treatment of co-morbid symptoms and involve families and relatives in the therapeutic process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The study of gene-environment interaction (G × E) has garnered widespread attention. The most common way to assess interaction effects is in a regression model with a G 9 E interaction term that is a product of the values specified for the genotypic (G) and environmental (E) variables. In this paper we discuss the circumstances under which interaction can be modeled as a product term and cases in which use of a product term is inappropriate and may lead to erroneous conclusions about the presence and nature of interaction effects. In the case of a binary coded genetic variant (as used in dominant and recessive models, or where the minor allele occurs so infrequently that it is not observed in the homozygous state), the regression coefficient corresponding to a significant interaction term reflects a slope difference between the two genotype categories and appropriately characterizes the statistical interaction between the genetic and environmental variables. However, when using a three-category polymorphic genotype, as is commonly done when modeling an additive effect, both false positive and false negative results can occur, and the nature of the interaction can be misrepresented. We present a reparameterized regression equation that accurately captures interaction effects without the constraints imposed by modeling interactions using a single cross-product term. In addition, we provide a series of recommendations for making conclusions about the presence of meaningful G × E interactions, which take into account the nature of the observed interactions and whether they map onto sensible genotypic models.

Abstract = {Background: In recent years, self‐tests have become increasingly available to the general public, though their value is still being debated. Because these tests are available, consumers should have access to clear information about self‐testing. Examining experiences of self‐testers could contribute to the development of consumer information. Objective: Detailed exploration of consumers’ experiences with self‐testing for cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: Semi‐structured interviews with 20 consumers who had performed a self‐test for glucose, cholesterol or albuminuria. The main topics of the interviews were reasons for self‐testing, performing the self‐test, follow‐up behaviour and perceived need for information on self‐testing. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Regarding the reason for self‐testing, three types of users were distinguished: those who engaged in self‐testing when a test was offered, either with or without previous knowledge about the disease or risk factor, and those who had actively decided to test and had searched for a self‐test themselves. Self‐testers had generally experienced no problems performing the test or interpreting the result and had considerable confidence in the result. They were easily reassured by a normal result, while an abnormal result did not automatically mean they consulted a doctor. Most participants did not feel the need for more information. Conclusions: Self‐testers often perform tests for reassurance, without considering the disadvantages, such as the absence of professional counselling and the risk of false‐positive or false‐negative results. Consumer information should promote more informed and deliberate choices for self‐testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {It has been shown that the anatomy of major white matter tracts can be delineated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Tract reconstruction, however, often suffers from a large number of false-negative results when a simple line propagation algorithm is used. This limits the application of this technique to only the core of prominent white matter tracts. By employing probabilistic path-generation algorithms, connectivity between a larger number of anatomical regions can be studied, but an increase in the number of false-positive results is inevitable. One of the causes of the inaccuracy is the complex axonal anatomy within a voxel; however, high-angular resolution (HAR) methods have been proposed to ameliorate this limitation. However, HAR data are relatively rare due to the long scan times required and the low signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we tested a probabilistic path-finding method in which two anatomical regions with known connectivity were pre-defined and a path that maximized agreement with the DTI data was searched. To increase the accuracy of the trajectories, knowledge-based anatomical constraints were applied.

Abstract = {I investigated whether negative affective states enhance encoding of and memory for item-specific information reducing false memories. Positive, negative, and neutral moods were induced, and participants then completed a Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) false-memory task. List items were presented in unique spatial locations or unique fonts to serve as measures for item-specific encoding. The negative mood conditions had more accurate memories for item-specific information, and they also had fewer false memories. The final experiment used a manipulation that drew attention to distinctive information, which aided learning for DRM words, but also promoted item-specific encoding. For the condition that promoted item-specific encoding, false memories were reduced for positive and neutral mood conditions to a rate similar to that of the negative mood condition. These experiments demonstrated that negative affective cues promote item-specific processing reducing false memories. People in positive and negative moods encode events differently creating different memories for the same event. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To develop an algorithm to identify and quantify BAT from PET/CT scans without radiologist interpretation. Design and Methods: Cases (n = 17) were randomly selected from PET/CT scans with documented "brown fat" by the reviewing radiologist. Controls (n = 18) had no documented "brown fat" and were matched with cases for age (49.7 [31.0-63.0] vs. 52.4 [24.0-70.0] yrs), outdoor temperature at scan date (51.8 [38.9-77.0] vs. 54.9 [35.2-74.6] °F), sex (F/M: 15/2 cases; 16/2 controls) and BMI (28.2 [20.0-45.7] vs. 26.8 [21.4-37.1] kg/m²]). PET/CT scans and algorithm-generated images were read by the same radiologist blinded to scan identity. Regions examined included neck, mediastinum, supraclavicular fossae, axilla and paraspinal soft tissues. BAT was scored 0 for no BAT; 1 for faint uptake possibly compatible with BAT or unknown; and 2 for BAT positive. Results: Agreement between the algorithm and PET/CT scan readings was 85.7% across all regions. The algorithm had a low false negative (1.6%) and higher false positive rate (12.7%). The false positive rate was greater in mediastinum, axilla and neck regions. Conclusion: The algorithm’s low false negative rate combined with further refinement will yield a useful tool for efficient BAT identification in a rapidly growing field particularly as it applies to obesity.

Abstract = {The present study investigated the production of false memories in relation to three independent factors: processing type, emotional context and affective valence of Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) lists. Four experimental hypotheses were tested: (a) higher rates of false memories will occur in tasks that require greater participation of conscious processing; (b) increase of false memories in emotional contexts; (c) greater falsification of memory in DRM lists with negative valence; and (d) more false memories in conscious processing, negative lists and unpleasant valence contexts. One hundred and fifty university students participated in the experiment. The emotional context was manipulated by inserting pictures from the International Affective Picture System (lAPS) within DRM lists. Results confirmed the experimental hypotheses and were discussed considering theories of nets and conjoint activations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Recent research has extended the belief-perseverance paradigm to the political realm, showing that negative information about political figures has a persistent effect on political opinions even after it has been discredited. However, little is known about the effects of false positive information about political figures. In three experiments, we find that discrediting positive information generates a “punishment effect” that is inconsistent with the previous literature on belief perseverance. We argue people attempt to adjust for the perceived influence of the false claim when the information is discredited. In this case, when trying to account for the effects of discredited positive information about a politician, people overestimate how much correction is needed and thus end up with a more negative opinion. (By contrast, people underestimate how much correction is needed to adjust for false negative information, leading to belief perseverance.) These results suggest that bogus credit claiming or other positive misinformation can have severe repercussions for politicians. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Several studies have found that children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits have a deficit in processing emotionally negative material. The present study examined whether this deficit also affects emotional memory. Twenty-two children with low CU traits and 24 children with high CU traits between 8 and 12 years of age were selected from a community sample and presented with neutral and negative emotional words, using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. On true recall, there was no difference between the groups. Both groups had higher true recall rates for the neutral word lists than for the negative lists. However, on false recall, although there were no group differences for neutral word lists, the high CU group recalled significantly fewer critical lures on the negative word lists than the low CU group. Furthermore, the high CU group had significantly less false recall on the negative word lists compared to the neutral word lists, while the low CU group showed no difference in false recall between the word lists. These results indicate that children with high CU traits have no deficiencies in true memory performance, yet are less susceptible to developing false memories concerning emotionally negative material.

Study with original and adapted AUDIT-C was conducted among 298 students to analyze the differences. Results: Adapted Slovenian version of AUDIT-C gives less false-positive and less false-negative results.

Abstract = {The use of cutoff scores on symptom validity measures has been applied to determine the authenticity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs compensation and pension examinations. This approach is controversial due to variations in the interpretation and application of cutoff scores from symptom validity testing. In response to the proposal that the cutoff score on the Morel Emotional Numbing Test for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (MENT) be increased, the diagnostic accuracy of the standard cutting score for identifying simulated symptoms of PTSD was compared to the proposed alternate cutoff score. The results of decision matrix tables (true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative) comparing the sensitivity and specificity and deriving confidence intervals for the standard cutoff score and proposed alternate cutoff score are presented. In addition, analyses using binomial probability theory to determine whether the outcome of increasing the cutoff score on the MENT meets reasonable standards for types I and II errors are presented.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare 3 T and 1.5 T fMRI results during emotional music listening. Stimuli comprised of psychoacoustically balanced instrumental musical pieces, with three different affective expressions (fear, neutral, joy). Participants (N = 32) were split into two groups, one subjected to fMRI scanning using 3 T and another group scanned using 1.5 T. Whole brain t-tests (corrected for multiple comparisons) compared joy and fear in each of the two groups. The 3 T group showed significant activity differences between joy and fear localized in bilateral superficial amygdala, bilateral hippocampus and bilateral auditory cortex. The 1.5 T group showed significant activity differences between joy and fear localized in bilateral auditory cortex and cuneus. This is the first study to compare results obtained under different field strengths with regard to affective processes elicited by means of auditory/musical stimulation. The findings raise concern over false negatives in the superficial amygdala and hippocampus in affective studies conducted under 1.5 T and caution that imaging improvements due to increasing magnetic field strength can be influenced by region-specific characteristics.

Abstract = {Recognition of a self‐image in a mirror is investigated using the mark test during which a mark is placed onto a point on the body that is not directly visible, and the presence or absence of self‐directed behaviors is evaluated for the mirror‐observing subjects. Great apes, dolphins, possibly elephants, and magpies have all passed the mark test, that is, displayed self‐directed behaviors, whereas monkeys, crows, and other animals have failed the test even though they were able to use a mirror to find a not‐directly‐visible object. Self‐directed behavior and mirror use are prerequisites of a successful mark test, and the absence of these behaviors may lead to false negative results. Epstein, Lanza, and Skinner (1981) reported self‐directed behavior of pigeons in front of a mirror after explicit training of self‐directed pecking and of pecking an object with the aid of a mirror, but certain other researchers could not confirm the results. The aim of the present study was to conduct the mark test with two pigeons that had received extensive training of the prerequisite behaviors. Crucial points of the training were identical topography (pecking) and the same reinforcement (food) in the prerequisite behaviors as well as sufficient training of these behaviors. After training for the prerequisite behaviors, both pigeons spontaneously integrated the learned self‐directed and mirror‐use behavior and displayed self‐directed behavior in a mark test. This indicates that pigeons display mirror self‐recognition after training of suitable ontogenetic contingency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

At this stage, the patient was reassured that Giant-cell arteritis (GCA) was unlikely. High-dose oral prednisolone was instituted, resulting in resolution of symptomatology. Methotrexate was also commenced, and has been slowly titrated, and the dose of prednisolone gradually tapered, without any clinical recurrence. Skip lesions are not uncommon in GCA and may result in false-negative biopsy results. Neurologists should remain vigilant for this possibility and recognize that further investigations may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of GCA, which, if untreated, can result in potentially life threatening complications.

Abstract = {To guide budgetary and policy‐level decisions, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) produces quarterly reports that count the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) codes for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 309.81) in their electronic medical record administrative data. We explored the accuracy of VA administrative data (i.e., diagnostic codes used for billing purposes), by comparing it to chart review evidence of PTSD (i.e., medical progress notes and all other clinical documentation contained in the entire VA medical record). We reviewed VA electronic medical records for a nationwide sample of 1,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with at least one ICD‐9‐CM code for PTSD in their VA administrative data. Among veterans sampled, 99.9% had 2 or more ICD‐9‐CM codes for PTSD. Reviewing all VA electronic medical record notes for these 1,000 veterans for the full course of their VA health care history revealed that PTSD was diagnosed by a mental health provider for 89.6%, refuted for 5.6%, and PTSD was never evaluated by a mental health provider for 4.8%. VA treatment notes for the 12 months preceding chart review showed that 661 veterans sampled received a VA PTSD diagnosis during that 12‐month timeframe, and of these 555 were diagnosed by a mental health provider (83.9%). Thus, the presence of an ICD‐9‐CM code for PTSD approximated diagnoses by VA mental health providers across time points (89.6% for entire treatment history and 83.9% for 12 months prior to chart review). Administrative data offer large‐scale means to track diagnoses and treatment utilization; however, their limitations are many, including the inability to detect false‐negatives.

Abstract = {Quantitative prediction of complex drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving hepatic transporters and cytochromes P450 (P450s) is challenging. We evaluated the extent of DDIs of nine victim drugs—which are substrates to organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and undergo P450 metabolism or biliary elimination—caused by five perpetrator drugs, using in vitro data and the proposed extended net-effect model. Hepatobiliary transport and metabolic clearance estimates were obtained from in vitro studies. Of the total of 62 clinical interaction combinations assessed using the net-effect model, 58 (94%) could be predicted within a 2-fold error, with few false-negative predictions. Model predictive performance improved significantly when in vitro active uptake clearance was corrected to recover in vivo clearance. The basic R-value model yielded only 63% predictions within 2-fold error. This study demonstrates that the interactions involving transporter-enzyme interplay need to be mechanistically assessed for quantitative rationalization and prospective prediction.

Abstract = {Objective: The present study sought to replicate previous findings of an association between the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) val158met polymorphism with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptomatology in a novel age group, preschool children. Methods: COMT genotype was determined in a sample of 171 3–6-year-old trauma-exposed children. PTSD was assessed with a semistructured interview. Accounting for sex, trauma type, and age, genotype was examined in relation to categorical and continuous measures of PTSD both controlling for race and within the two largest racial categories (African American [AA] and European American [EA]). Results: Race significantly moderated the association between genotype and PTSD. Specifically, the genotype associated with increased PTSD symptoms in one racial group had the opposite association in the other racial group. For AA children the met/met genotype was associated with more PTSD symptoms. However, for EA children, val allele carriers had more PTSD symptoms. Whereas every AA child with the met/met genotype met criteria for PTSD, none of the EA children with the met/met genotype did. This genetic association with COMT genotype, in both races but in opposite directions, was most associated with increased arousal symptoms. Conclusions: These findings replicate previous findings in participants of African descent, highlight the moderating effect of race on the association between COMT genotype and PTSD, and provide direct evidence that consideration of population stratification within gene-by-environment studies is valuable to prevent false negative findings.

Abstract = {This paper details a novel probabilistic method for automatic neural spike sorting which uses stochastic point process models of neural spike trains and parameterized action potential waveforms. A novel likelihood model for observed firing times as the aggregation of hidden neural spike trains is derived, as well as an iterative procedure for clustering the data and finding the parameters that maximize the likelihood. The method is executed and evaluated on both a fully labeled semiartificial dataset and a partially labeled real dataset of extracellular electric traces from rat hippocampus. In conditions of relatively high difficulty (i.e., with additive noise and with similar action potential waveform shapes for distinct neurons) the method achieves significant improvements in clustering performance over a baseline waveform-only Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering on the semiartificial set (1.98% reduction in error rate) and outperforms both the GMM and a state-of-the-art method on the real dataset (5.04% reduction in false positive + false negative errors). Finally, an empirical study of two free parameters for our method is performed on the semiartificial dataset. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To present performance norms and discrepancy score of three one-minute verbal fluency tasks (VFTs); to investigate age and education effects; to analyze the differences between time intervals; and to investigate whether these differences varied according to age and education. Method: Three hundred adults divided into three age groups (19-39; 40-59; 60-75) and two groups of educational level (2 to 7 years; 8 years or more) performed unconstrained, semantic, and phonemic VFTs. We compared the performance of the groups using two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test. The depression scale score was covariate. The time interval of verbal fluency was the variable used for subjects' comparison (repeated measures ANOVA). Results and conclusions: Our results suggest that there are age and education effects on phonemic and unconstrained VFTs. We also found an interaction between those variables in the semantic VFT (time intervals and total time) and in the differences between semantic and phonemic tasks. The repeated measures analysis revealed age effects on semantic VFTs and education effects on the phonemic and semantic VFTs. Such findings are relevant for clinical neuropsychology, contributing to avoid false-positive or false-negative interpretation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Lie detectors can be applied in a wide variety of settings. But this advantage comes with a considerable cost: False positives. The applicability of the Concealed Information Test (CIT) is more limited, yet when it can be applied, the risk of false accusations can be set a priori at a very low level. The CIT assesses the recognition of critical information that is known only by the examiners and the culprit, for example, the face of an accomplice. Large effects are obtained with the CIT, whether combined with peripheral, brain, or motor responses. We see three important challenges for the CIT. First, the false negative rate of the CIT can be substantial, particularly under realistic circumstances. A possible solution seems to restrict the CIT to highly salient details. Second, there exist effective faking strategies. Future research will tell whether faking can be detected or even prevented (e.g., using covert measures). Third, recognition of critical crime details does not necessarily result from criminal activity. It is therefore important to properly embed the CIT in the investigative process, while taking care when drawing conclusions from the test outcome (recognition, not guilt).

The current study evaluates the predictive validity of these intentions to offend. Methods: Undergraduate students (n=726) read a fictitious but seemingly realistic newspaper article describing an illegal opportunity for acquiring digital music files, and then reported their intentions to act upon the opportunity. Afterward, participants’ real world attempts to follow-through on the opportunity were monitored covertly. Results: Findings reveal that participants who reported weak intentions to offend typically refrained from the act, resulting in a low false negative rate. However, those who reported strong intentions to offend also typically refrained from the act, thereby resulting in a high false positive rate. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while participants’ predictions of criminal abstention are generally accurate, their predictions of criminal involvement are more problematic. Such faulty intentions have important implications for research on criminal decision making. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To interpret questionnaire scores, clinicians and researchers need to know what change in score reflects a meaningful change in the condition of an individual patient, and what difference reflects a meaningful difference between groups. These values differ between different populations. We determined the within-person minimally important change (MIC) and the between-group minimally important difference (MID) of the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire in a primary-care population of migraine patients. Methods: We included 490 patients who participated in a clinical trial on the treatment of migraine in primary care. We compared their change scores on the HIT-6 questionnaire between baseline and at three-months follow-up with the answers to two anchor questions according to the ‘mean change approach’ and the ‘ROC curve approach’. Results: The within-person MIC was estimated to be between -2.5 points (mean change approach) and -6 points (ROC curve approach). The choice for the within-person MIC value depends on the consequences of false positives and false negatives in a particular setting. The between-group MID was estimated at -1.5 points. Conclusions: We determined the within-person MIC and between-group MID for the HIT-6 in a primary-care population of migraine patients. We recommend the use of these values for clinical care and for research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and its screening version, the PCL:SV, are clinical assessment instruments for the observer rating of psychopathic personality in offenders. Given the link between PCL-R/SV total scores and violent offending, these instruments have been incorporated into various risk assessment protocols in forensic psychology. The purpose of the present study was to examine the predictive validity of the PCL-R/SV instruments in German-speaking countries. We collated data from 11 published studies (total-N = 2,412 offenders). Based on suitable diagnostic cutscores for prototypical psychopathy, the proportions of true-positive and false-positive cases with respect to violent reoffending were compared. Overall, sensitivity was estimated at 27% and specificity at 88% for the PCL-R (or at 28% and 90% for the PCL:SV, respectively). At critical score levels, the odds for violent offense recidivism were more than two times higher than at subcritical levels for both instruments. A decision-theory analysis suggested that the implicit utility of false-positive risk assessments was about halfway between the minimal utility of false-negative assessments and the maximal utility of correct assessments. Both the PCL-R and its screening version are viable instruments for the prediction of violent offense recidivism in German-speaking countries.

Abstract = {Since abnormalities in distal upper limb development are among the minor physical anomalies associated with schizophrenia we attempted to determine whether patients with schizophrenia can be identified on the basis of specific morphologic and dermatoglyphic features of the hand. Photographs and prints of the hands of 38 patients with schizophrenia and those of 42 control subjects were evaluated and graded on 13 biometric parameters. Results were statistically evaluated. A combination of three of the parameters was found to have good predicting abilities to distinguish between schizophrenics and controls. Subjects having high values in these three parameters were found to have a higher propensity to be defined as schizophrenics. In order to define a simple rule for classifying subjects we chose a criterion of having a value of 3 (in a scale from 1 to 3) in at least one of these three discriminating variables. This rule yielded an overall accuracy of 81.2%. Among controls, 85.7% of subjects did not fulfill such criteria, while 14.3% were defined as false positives. Among schizophrenics 76.3% achieved this condition while 23.7% were false negatives. The technique's objectivity and ease of application could facilitate the diagnosis of this disease.

Abstract = {This editorial presents, an introduction to the special issue of Cognitive, Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience on reliability and replication in cognitive and affective neuroscience research. The articles in this special issue fall into three general categories: research into the importance and influence of methods choices and reporting; assessments of reliability and novel approaches to statistical analysis; and studies of power, sample size, and the importance of both false positives and false negatives. The articles do not address all of the issues associated with the replication concerns noted in many scientific domains. However, they do try to tackle a number of the most critical and pressing issues, and many of the authors offer concrete and practical approaches that researchers can begin to integrate into their own work to enhance methodological clarify, reliability, and power, as a way to increase the robustness and interpretability of results reported in the field.

Abstract = {Suicides are a leading cause of death in psychiatric patients, and in society at large. Developing more quantitative and objective ways (biomarkers) for predicting and tracking suicidal states would have immediate practical applications and positive societal implications. We undertook such an endeavor. First, building on our previous blood biomarker work in mood disorders and psychosis, we decided to identify blood gene expression biomarkers for suicidality, looking at differential expression of genes in the blood of subjects with a major mood disorder (bipolar disorder), a high-risk population prone to suicidality. We compared no suicidal ideation (SI) states and high SI states using a powerful intrasubject design, as well as an intersubject case-case design, to generate a list of differentially expressed genes. Second, we used a comprehensive Convergent Functional Genomics (CFG) approach to identify and prioritize from the list of differentially expressed gene biomarkers of relevance to suicidality. CFG integrates multiple independent lines of evidence—genetic and functional genomic data—as a Bayesian strategy for identifying and prioritizing findings, reducing the false-positives and false-negatives inherent in each individual approach. Third, we examined whether expression levels of the blood biomarkers identified by us in the live bipolar subject cohort are actually altered in the blood in an age-matched cohort of suicide completers collected from the coroner's office, and report that 13 out of the 41 top CFG scoring biomarkers (32%) show step-wise significant change from no SI to high SI states, and then to the suicide completers group. Six out of them (15%) remained significant after strict Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Fourth, we show that the blood levels of SAT1 (spermidine/spermine N1 -acetyltransferase 1), the top biomarker identified by us, at the time of testing for this study, differentiated future as well as past hospitalizations with suicidality, in a live cohort of bipolar disorder subjects, and exhibited a similar but weaker pattern in a live cohort of psychosis (schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder) subjects. Three other (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3)) of the six biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction showed similar but weaker effects. Taken together, the prospective and retrospective hospitalization data suggests SAT1, PTEN, MARCKS and MAP3K3 might be not only state biomarkers but trait biomarkers as well. Fifth, we show how a multi-dimensional approach using SAT1 blood expression levels and two simple visual-analog scales for anxiety and mood enhances predictions of future hospitalizations for suicidality in the bipolar cohort (receiver-operating characteristic curve with area under the curve of 0.813). Of note, this simple approach does not directly ask about SI, which some individuals may deny or choose not to share with clinicians. Lastly, we conducted bioinformatic analyses to identify biological pathways, mechanisms and medication targets. Overall, suicidality may be underlined, at least in part, by biological mechanisms related to stress, inflammation and apoptosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A clinical reappraisal study was carried out in conjunction with the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) All-Army Study (AAS) to evaluate concordance of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales (CIDI-SC) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist (PCL) with diagnoses based on independent clinical reappraisal interviews (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [SCID]). Diagnoses included: lifetime mania/hypomania, panic disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder; six-month adult attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder; and 30-day major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and substance (alcohol or drug) use disorder (abuse or dependence). The sample (n = 460) was weighted for over-sampling CIDI-SC/PCL screened positives. Diagnostic thresholds were set to equalize false positives and false negatives. Good individual-level concordance was found between CIDI-SC/PCL and SCID diagnoses at these thresholds (area under curve [AUC] = 0.69–0.79). AUC was considerably higher for continuous than dichotomous screening scale scores (AUC = 0.80–0.90), arguing for substantive analyses using not only dichotomous case designations but also continuous measures of predicted probabilities of clinical diagnoses.

Abstract = {Objective: This study was to investigate the utility of motor evoked potential monitoring elicited by transcranial electrical stimulation (tcMEP) during CEA in addition to the established median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (mSSEPs). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from 600 patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia with monitoring of mSSEPs and tcMEPs in a multicenter study. MSSEP and tcMEP parameters were recorded during internal carotid artery (ICA) cross clamping and compared with the postoperative motor outcome, demographic and patient history data. Results: The intraoperative monitoring of tcMEPs was successful in 594 of the patients (99%) and selective shunt was performed in 29 of them (4.83%). Nine of the patients showed a transient contralateral loss of tcMEPs, without changes in mSSEPs and required intervention (1.5% ‘‘false-negative’’). Three of them showed postoperative motor deficits. The time period from tcMEP loss to intervention was significantly longer (p = 0.01) in this group compared to the patients without postoperative motor deficit. TcMEPs during CEA may be an adjunct to mSSEP monitoring to avoid "false-negative" mSSEP results, as mSSEPs seem to lack specificity for detecting isolated ischemia of corticospinal pathway. TcMEPs seem to improve postoperative outcome, especially in case of a timely correction of cerebral ischemia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of anatomically segregated regions interconnected by white matter pathways, known as the human connectome. Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to reconstruct this structural brain network in vivo and noninvasively. However, due to a wide variety of influences, both false positive and false negative connections may occur. By choosing a ‘group threshold’, brain networks of multiple subjects can be combined into a single reconstruction, affecting the occurrence of these false positives and negatives. In this case, only connections that are detected in a large enough percentage of the subjects, specified by the group threshold, are considered to be present. Although this group threshold has a substantial impact on the resulting reconstruction and subsequent analyses, it is often chosen intuitively. Here, we introduce a model to estimate how the choice of group threshold influences the presence of false positives and negatives. Based on our findings, group thresholds should preferably be chosen between 30% and 90%. Our results further suggest that a group threshold of circa 60% is a suitable setting, providing a good balance between the elimination of false positives and false negatives.

Abstract = {Background: Overweight, obesity and weight gain are significant problems in the US fire service. While classification of obesity using body mass index (BMI) has demonstrated accuracy and low rates of false positives when compared with body fat percentage (BF%)–based standards, no studies have examined the accuracy of BMI-based overweight and normal weight status with other comparable body composition indices. Aims: To compare overweight and normal weight BMI categories with BF% standards from the American Council on Exercise and analogous waist circumference (WC) categories and to examine rates and types of misclassification in fire fighters. Methods: Data were collected from 11 randomly selected career fire departments in the International Association of Fire Chief’s Missouri Valley Region. Demographics, occupational history, and body composition indices (weight, BF% and WC) were obtained from male career fire fighters who were categorized as normal weight or overweight based on BMI. Results: There were 293 participants of whom 92 had normal BMI. There were low rates of false positives (12%) and moderate rates of false negatives (22%) when comparing BMI categories to the comparable BF% categories. However, using WC as the standard resulted in very high rates of false positives (63%) and very low rates of false negatives (5%). Conclusions: BMI-based overweight status was associated with significant errors in classification depending on the standard to which it was compared.

Abstract = {Presents a study which examined the effect of three elements central to understanding the potential harms of deception in research: deceptive task instructions; false feedback; and the interpersonal deception of experimenter professionalism. The task deception manipulation examines the effect of deceiving participants about the true purpose of a study. The false feedback manipulation examined the impact of leading people to believe something about themselves that was not actually true. Examining both task deception and experimenter behavior required two simultaneous layers of deception. The deception surrounding the nature of the study task was surrounded by a layer of deception related to the experimenter's behavior. The result of the study showed that although false feedback did not have a negative psychological impact on participants, the professionalism manipulation had a significant effect. Participants who were treated unprofessionally reported greater negative perceptions about their study experience and greater negative emotions compared to those treated professionally by the research assistant. The only manipulation that was significantly predictive in these analyses was that individuals in the direct task manipulation were more likely to guess during funnel debriefing that there was an alternative purpose to the study although they were no more likely to correctly guess the specific nature of the deceptive interpersonal manipulation.

Abstract = {Background and purpose: To evaluate a dipstick algorithm for urinary tract colonization, prior to high-dose corticosteroid treatment in acute relapses of multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Prospective cohort study of 267 consecutive patients with MS relapses requiring corticosteroid treatment in a hospital-based, ambulatory, acute MS relapse clinic. A total of 18 participants met the exclusion criteria, leaving 249 for analysis. Main outcome measures were urinary dipstick sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and safety of antibiotic co-treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. Results: Significant bacteriuria (≥ 10⁵ colonies ml) rate in this population was 11% (95% CI, 7.1–14.9). Specificity and sensitivity of positive leucocyte esterase or nitrite were 78% and 65%. Negative predictive value of urine dipstick was 96%. No clinical adverse events occurred in the 3% (95% CI, 0.9–5.1) of patients with a false-negative dipstick. Eighteen per cent of patients were unnecessarily treated with antibiotics for 48 h. Conclusion: Urinary dipstick testing allows for rapid and safe management of patients suffering from an acute MS relapse. The algorithm is conservative, and future work is needed to reduce the false-positive rate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by A. Singh-Manoux et al. (see record [rid]2014-32434-005[/rid]). Singh-Manoux et al. presented a large study evaluating whether 2 midlife blood biomarkers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), predict subsequent cognitive decline. IL-6, but not CRP, predicted cognitive decline, particularly in the reasoning domain and overall cognition. This study is valuable and timely, supplementing prior studies showing that a high level of CRP, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor–a is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline. The Singh-Manoux et al. study reinforces the concept that significant associations of average inflammatory biomarkers between declining and non-declining groups do not ensure that these biomarkers will be useful for individual risk prediction. There was a relatively high proportion of false-positives and false negatives around any IL-6 cut point. Despite the group differences, measurement of IL-6 in midlife is highly unlikely to be useful in clinical practice on an individual level. CRP in human plasma is routinely measured by light-scattering immunoassays that are based on agglutination reactions involving formation of bridges between antibodies and antigens. In the case of CRP, the dissociation of a pentameric molecule reduces the number of antigenic determinants per antigen molecule, and thus the number of viable antibody-binding sites per molecule. In spite of these weaknesses, there are important strengths in using peripheral inflammatory markers as potential predictors of cognitive decline.

Genome‐wide studies have been successful in identifying stable associations of single genes, albeit at the price of a high false negative rate. The promise of endophenotypes to increase power of genome‐wide association studies has only been partially fulfilled. To optimize the investigation of genetic influences on behavioral (endo‐)phenotypes, the development of novel phenotypical characterizations and methods to describe the relation between genotype and phenotype are needed. This will require the development of innovative analytical strategies, as well as corroborative approaches linking association studies with functional characterizations. The sole reliance on canonical genome‐wide significance thresholds is not sufficient to describe the complex relation of genotype and phenotype.

The present study examined the degree to which various diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic databases were concordant with PTSD diagnostic status determined by standardized diagnostic interview. Method: We interviewed 1,649 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars using the PTSD Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV (SCID). Participants also completed other interview-based and self-report measures of psychopathology and provided consent to access their electronic medical records (EMRs). Results: Concordance between database diagnosis and SCID diagnosis was 72.3% for current PTSD and 79.4% for lifetime PTSD. We observed associations between concordance status and combat exposure, PTSD symptom presentation, comorbid anxiety and depression, and psychosocial impairment. Veterans with false-negative PTSD diagnoses in the EMR were more likely to report lower levels of combat exposure, panic, and PTSD avoidance symptoms. Veterans with false-positive PTSD diagnoses in the EMR were more likely to report treatment seeking for emotional problems and less overall functional impairment. Conclusions: Although the majority of participants were concordant for PTSD status, over 25% of EMR diagnoses differed from those obtained in the diagnostic interview, with varying proportions of false positives and false negatives. Overall, those individuals with the most and least severe symptom presentations in the diagnostic interview were more likely to be accurately classified.

Abstract = {Several studies have evaluated false positives and false negatives produced with partial interval recording (PIR) and momentary time sampling (MTS) using simulated data. However, no study to date has evaluated false positives and negatives using a large sample of non‐simulated behaviors. In addition, few studies have evaluated whether interval methods of data collection alter trends that are evident in continuous records. We conducted three experiments to evaluate the extent to which various interval sizes of MTS and PIR produced false negatives (Experiment 1), false positives (Experiment 2), and trends that were inconsistent with the continuous records (Experiment 3). Collectively, the results show the following: (i) 10‐s PIR and 10‐s MTS produced few false negatives and few false positives (i.e., both were sensitive) to changes in duration events; (ii) 10‐s PIR produced very few false negatives, but an unexpected high percentage of false positives for frequency events; and (iii) each interval size of PIR and MTS produced a high percentage of changes in trending for duration events and frequency events. We briefly discuss the potential limitations and clinical implications of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose: Technology of ear infrared (IR) thermometers has improved. This study compared a modern ear thermometer to forehead or temporal artery thermometers. Methods: Temperatures were measured with a heated-tip ear thermometer, a temporal artery thermometer, 3 forehead thermometers, and a thermistor-based reference thermometer in monitor mode. Results: In 171 subjects, mean bias with the forehead thermometers was significantly higher (p < .001) than with the ear thermometer (0.01 °C ± 0.41 °C). In 64 febrile subjects, bias with the ear thermometer was significantly lower than with 3 of the other thermometers. A false-negative reading was less likely with the ear thermometer (8%) versus the others (55%, 56%, 28%, and 47%). Conclusions: Modern ear thermometry provides more precise measurements closer to those of a reference thermometer and is less likely to give false-negative readings than forehead or temporal artery measurements.

Abstract = {Background: Controversy continues about screening mammography, in part because of the risk of false-negative and false-positive mammograms. Pre-test breast cancer risk factors may improve the positive and negative predictive value of screening. Purpose: To create a model that estimates the potential impact of pre-test risk prediction using clinical and genomic information on the reclassifıcation of women with abnormal mammograms (BI-RADS3 and BI-RADS4 [Breast Imaging–Reporting and Data System]) above and below the threshold for breast biopsy. Methods: The current study modeled 1-year breast cancer risk in women with abnormal screening mammograms using existing data on breast cancer risk factors, 12 validated breast cancer singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and probability of cancer given the BI-RADS category. Examination was made of reclassifıcation of women above and below biopsy thresholds of 1%, 2%, and 3% risk. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data were collected from 1996 to 2002. Data analysis was conducted in 2010 and 2011. Results: Using a biopsy risk threshold of 2% and the standard risk factor model, 5% of women with a BI-RADS3 mammogram had a risk above the threshold, and 3% of women with BI-RADS4A mammograms had a risk below the threshold. The addition of 12 SNPs in the model resulted in 8% of women with a BI-RADS3 mammogram above the threshold for biopsy and 7% of women with BI-RADS4A mammograms below the threshold. Conclusions: The incorporation of pre-test breast cancer risk factors could change biopsy decisions for a small proportion of women with abnormal mammograms. The greatest impact comes from standard breast cancer risk factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Given the importance of early intervention services for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), early diagnosis of children is critical. At present, several ASD screeners exist for young children, with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) being one of the most widely researched. While the M-CHAT has good sensitivity and specificity, the presence of false positives and false negatives is inevitable. While false positives are not as disconcerting, since follow-up assessment will reveal the absence of ASD, false negatives can inadvertently delay much needed services to toddlers. The current study examined parental report for 552 toddlers who were referred for early intervention services due to being part of an at-risk population. The groups were divided into four groups based on their M-CHAT scores and actual diagnoses—a true positive group (n = 150), false positive group (n = 150), true negative group (n = 151), and false negative group (n = 101). All four groups were compared with respect to their total M-CHAT score and total critical items score on the M-CHAT. While the true positive and false positive groups significantly differed from the true negative and false negative groups on both of these dimensions, significant differences were also found between the true and false positive groups but not between the true and false negative groups. Furthermore, all 23 M-CHAT items were more commonly endorsed by individuals in the true positive group when compared to the false positive group, while differences in item endorsements between the true and false negative groups were scant. Based on these results, the true and false positive groups tended to be more easily discriminated from one another while the true and false negative groups presented themselves similarly. The implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In spite of the economic and social relevance of the prevalence of malingering in temporary incapacity, there are very few studies in Spain dealing with this problem. The aim of the present paper is to address this matter by looking into those pathologies that according to professionals show the highest rates of malingering in the medico-legal context For this purpose, we used an incidental sample of 161 doctors (56% of them were women) from 26 different Spanish provinces, with an age range of 30 to 59 (M = 43.6, SD = 6.5) and an average seniority on the Job of 17 years (SD = 6.3). They were asked to complete a brief questionnaire indicating those pathologies in which they thought malingering was more frequent, what percentage of these conditions they thought was simulated, the sociodemographic profile of malingerers (age, income, occupation, etc.), and what data they considered to be an indication for suspicion. The results showed that the doctors perceived the highest rates of malingering to be associated with chronic pain conditions (cervical sprain, lumbago, neck and shoulder pain, fibromyalgia) and affective/emotional conditions (anxiety and depression). The prototypical sociodemographic profile was a middle-aged person, with an unstimulating job and a low or moderate income, and who once had an injury or disorder and decided to prolong it over time in order to maintain the benefits obtained. These results are presented within the frame of the adaptive malingering model and linked to the need to develop specific malingering protocols which minimize the risk of false positives and false negatives in the assessment process.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the impact of numeric risk information about false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) rates in faecal occult blood testing (FOBt) on attitudes towards screening. Methods: 95 people aged 45–59, living in England, read 6 hypothetical vignettes presented online about the use of FOB testing to detect bowel cancer, in which information about FN and FP rates was systematically varied. Results: Both verbal and numeric FN risk information reduced people’s interest in screening compared with no FN information. Numeric FN risk information reduced people’s perceptions of screening effectiveness and lowered perceived trust in the results of screening compared with both verbal FN information and no FN information. FP information did not affect attitudes towards FOB testing. There was limited evidence that FN information reduced interest and perceptions of screening effectiveness more in educated groups. Conclusion: Numeric FN risk information decreased people’s perceptions of screening effectiveness and trust in the results of screening but did not affect people’s interest in screening anymore than verbal FN risk information. Practice Implications: Numeric FN information could be added to patient information without affecting interest in screening, although this needs to be replicated in a larger, more representative sample.

Abstract = {The Management Standards Indicator Tool (MSIT) is a 35-item self-report measure of the psychosocial work environment designed to assist organizations with psychosocial risk assessment. It is also used in work environment research. Edwards and Webster presented a 25-item version of the MSIT based on the deletion of items having a factor loading of < .65. Stress theory and research suggest that psychosocial hazard exposures may result in harm to the health of workers. Thus, using data collected from three UK organizations (N = 20,406) we compared the concurrent validity of the brief and full versions of the MSIT by exploring the strength of association between each version of the instrument and a measure of psychological wellbeing (GHQ-12 and Maslach Burnout Inventory). Analyses revealed that the brief instrument offered similar but not always equal validity to that of the full version. The results indicate that use of the brief instrument, which would be less disruptive for employees, would not elevate the risk of false negative or false positive findings in risk assessment.

Abstract = {Despite widespread use, the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) has been criticized for excessive false positives as an indicator of pathological gambling (PG), and for items that misalign with PG criteria. We examine the relationship between SOGS scores and PG symptoms and convergent validity with regard to personality, mood, and addictive behaviors in a sample of 353 gamblers. SOGS scores correlated r = .66 with both DSM-IV and DSM-5 symptoms, and they manifested similar correlations with external criteria (intraclass correlation of .95). However, 195 false positives and 1 false negative were observed when using the recommended cut point, yielding an 81% false alarm rate. For uses with DSM-IV criteria, a cut point of 10 would retain high sensitivity with greater specificity and fewer false positives. For DSM-5 criteria, we advocate a cut point of 8 for use as a clinical screen and a cut point of 12 for prevalence and pseudo-experimental studies.

Abstract = {Accurately sorting individual neurons is a technical challenge and plays an important role in identifying information flow among neurons. Spike sorting errors are almost unavoidable and can roughly be divided into two types: false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). This study investigates how FPs and FNs affect results of the Granger causality (GC) analysis, a powerful method for detecting causal interactions between time series signals. We derived an explicit formula based on a first order vector autoregressive model to analytically study the effects of FPs and FNs. The proposed formula was able to reveal the intrinsic properties of the GC, and was verified by simulation studies. The effects of FPs and FNs were further evaluated using real experimental data from the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus. Some practical suggestions for spike sorting are also provided in this paper. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine contributors to perceived risk in pregnancy and its utility in predicting lower birth weight and earlier delivery in conjunction with health care providers' assessment of obstetric risk. Methods: 165 pregnant women at high (n = 34) or low (n = 131) obstetric risk completed assessments of perceived risk, stress, optimism, and health behaviors using well-validated instruments and measures designed for this study. Medical charts were abstracted for gestational age at delivery and birth weight. Results: 40% of the sample perceived their risk status differently than their health care provider. Stress, poor reproductive history, provider assigned risk, and unhealthful behaviors were significant, independent predictors of perceived risk (R² = .37). The greatest difference in birth weight (p = .003) and gestational age (p = .05) was between women considered at low risk by both self and provider and women considered at high risk by both. Perceived risk improved prediction of adverse birth outcomes, especially lower birth weight, in women considered by providers to be at low risk. Conclusion: Women's perceptions of risk are an important contributor to prediction of birth outcomes, but the combination of information from both a woman and her health care provider is superior. Incorporating women's perceptions into obstetric risk determination may help to reduce the number of women identified as high risk who subsequently have a normal birth outcome (false positives), and more importantly, the number of women considered to be at low risk who ultimately experience an adverse outcome (false negatives).

Abstract = {Introduction and objective: In computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tools searching for colonrectal polyps and based on three dimensions virtual colonoscopy (3DVC) using computed tomography (CT) images, the reduction of the occurrence of false-positives (FPs) still represents a challenge because they are source of unreliability. Following an encouraging previous supervised approach Bevilacqua et al., Three-dimensional Virtual Colonoscopy for Polyps Detection by Supervised Artificial Neural Networks D.-S. Huang et al. (Eds.): ICIC, LNBI 6840, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, (2011), pp. 596–603, the aim of this work is to discuss, in details, how the adopted strategies, designed and tested on an initial reduced data set, reveals good performance and robustness in terms of FPs reduction on an enlarged cohort of new cases. Materials and methods: At the beginning, materials consisted only in 10 different polyps, diagnosed, by expert radiologists, in 6 different patients, scanning 16 rows helical CT multi slices with a resolution of 1mm. Moreover from those 10 polyps only 7 polyps were initially used for the analysis, excluding 2 tumors with diameter bigger than 1 cm, and one polyp hardly recognizable due to fecal stool. In this paper, thanks to a new accurate phase of collecting data, materials grow impressively and then consist in total of 43 polyps all useful for the study. The whole data set was merged by using the former data set of colonrectal exams from the clinical operative unit called "Sezione di Diagnostica per Immagini" of Di.M.I.M.P. of Policlinico of Bari and the new ones coming from two new collaborations: the Oncology department of Faculty of Medicine of University of Pisa participating, as the former, to the IMPACT study (Italian Multicenter Polyps Accuracy CTC Study) Regge, Linear and nonlinear feedforward neural network classifiers: a comprehensive understanding, J. Intell. Syst., 9 (1) 1999, 1–38 and, more recently, the operative unit of radiology of the "Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II" of Bari. Starting from computed tomography colonography (CTC) images, several volumes were scanned by means of three different supervised artificial neural networks (ANNs) architectures based on error back propagation training algorithm Huang and Ma, Linear and nonlinear feedforward neural network classifiers: a comprehensive understanding, J. Intell. Syst., 9 (1) 1999, 1–38. All the training sets were built by using polyps and non-polyps sub-volume samples, whose dimensions were correlated to the volume of the polyps to be detected. Results: The performance of the best ANN architecture, trained by using a training set of 27 sessile polyps from the new 43 available dataset, were evaluated in terms of FPs and false-negatives and compared to the results shown in Bevilacqua et al., Three-dimensional Virtual Colonoscopy for Polyps Detection by Supervised Artificial Neural Networks D.-S. Huang et al. (Eds.): ICIC, LNBI 6840, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, (2011), pp. 596–603 where a cross validation strategy was used to overcome the small number of the old available dataset Huang, The bottleneck behaviour in linear feedforward neural network classifiers and their breakthrough, J. Comput. Sci. Technol., 14 (1) 1999, 34–43. Good performances in terms of generalization and robustness of the previous work, are then shown by the fact that the free-response operator characteristic analysis do not change significantly thanks to the enlargement of the available data. Conclusions: This testing determined that the supervised ANN approach is consistent and reveals good performance; at the same time it is fairly intuitive that it is necessary to train a method by using polyps and non-polyps samples and that, for this reason, the overall performance could be improved by a larger dataset diagnosed by expert radiologists.

Abstract = {Previous research is replete with examples of the negative consequences of false memories. In the current research, we provide a different perspective on false memories and their development and demonstrate that false memories can have positive consequences. Specifically, we examined the role false memories play in subsequent problem‐solving tasks. Children and adults studied and recalled neutral or survival‐relevant lists of associated words. They then solved age-normed compound remote associates, some of whose solutions had been primed by false memories created when studying the previous lists. The results showed that regardless of age: (a) survival-related words were not only better recollected but were also more susceptible than neutral words to false memory illusions; and (b) survival-related false memories were better than neutral false memories as primes for problem‐solving. These findings are discussed in the context of recent speculation concerning the positive consequences of false memories, and the adaptive nature of reconstructive memory.

Abstract = {Objective: Surveys assessing alcohol use among physicians have most commonly employed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or the AUDIT-C, the most common short version of the AUDIT. As with other screeners, prevalence estimation is dependent on the accuracy of the test as well as choice of the cutoff value. The aim of the current study is to derive more precise prevalence estimates of alcohol problems in physicians by correcting for false-positive and false-negative results. Method: In the context of a survey, the AUDIT was sent out via email or standard postal service to all 2484 physicians in Salzburg, Austria. A total of 456 physicians participated. A published correction formula was used to estimate the real prevalence of alcohol use problems. Results: Applying a cutoff of 5 points for the AUDIT-C, 15.7% of female and 37.7% of male physicians screened positive. Use of a correction based on general population data and the sensitivity and specificity of the AUDIT-C resulted in much lower prevalence rates: 4.0% for female and 9.5% for male physicians. Using the full AUDIT, 19.6% of the female physicians and 48% of the male physicians were screened positive. Using the correction, the estimated prevalence rates for females and males were 6.3% and 15.5%, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that uncorrected screening results may markedly overestimate the prevalence of physicians drinking problems.

Abstract = {The physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) has been the most popular simple method of screening for people who intend to engage in exercise programs. Despite of the recommendations indicating that the instrument should be applied in the age range from 15 to 69 years, the questionnaire has been widely used in elderly people. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of PAR-Q in elderly women with respect to absolute and relative contraindications to exercise and verify the influence of educational level and cognitive status. Eighty-nine subjects (61–89 years) participated in the study and went through clinical exams and exercise testing. The influence of educational status, age and cognitive state (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) on the PAR-Q responses was analyzed by logistic regression. The occurrences of absolute and relative contraindications were respectively 9% and 22%. The Sensitivity and Specificity were 75.0% and 19.8% (absolute) and 77.8% and 19.7% (relative). The PAR-Q results were not influenced by low educational status; age, or cognitive state. In conclusion, although the usefulness and easy applicability of the PAR-Q's questions, the responses to the questionnaire led to a high number of false positive and false negative cases, suggesting that it would not be adequate as a pre-participation screening tool in elder samples.

Abstract = {The primary aim of the current study was to examine whether depleted cognitive resources might have ramifications for the formation of neutral and negative spontaneous false memories. To examine this, participants received neutral and negative Deese/Roediger–McDermott false memory wordlists. Also, for half of the participants, cognitive resources were depleted by use of an ego depletion manipulation (solving difficult calculations while being interfered with auditory noise). Our chief finding was that depleted cognitive resources made participants more vulnerable for the production of false memories. Our results shed light on how depleted cognitive resources affect neutral and negative correct and errant memories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Mucopolysaccharidosis-IIIB or Sanfilippo-B syndrome is caused by deficiency of lysosomal α-N-acetylglucosaminidase that leads to accumulation of heparan-sulphate and degeneration of central nervous system with progressive dementia, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. Mucopolysaccharidosis-III remains underdiagnosed as a cause of developmental delay and hyperactivity both in adults and children because in contrast to other mucopolysaccharidoses, they have little somatic disease, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly or skeletal changes, and a high incidence of false-negative results on the urinary screening tests. We describe here a girl with the classic phenotype of mucopolysaccharidosis-IIIB to alert pediatricians to the possibility of this disorder in children with unexplained speech delay and hyperactivity and prevent unnecessary investigations.

Abstract = {Background: Making informed decisions about cancer screening involves understanding the benefits and harms in conjunction with personal values. There is little research examining factors associated with informed decision making or participation in screening in the context of a decision aid trial. Objectives: To identify factors associated with informed choice and participation in fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) among lower education populations. Design: Randomized controlled trial of an FOBT decision aid conducted between July and November 2008. Setting: Socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in New South Wales, Australia. Participants: Included 572 adults aged 55 to 64 years with lower education. Measurements: Sociodemographic variables, perceived health literacy, and involvement preferences in decision making were examined to identify predictors of informed choice (knowledge, attitudes, and behavior). Results: Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of making an informed choice as having higher education (relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.95; P = 0.001), receiving the decision aid (RR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.87–4.44; P < 0.001), and being male (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11–1.97; P = 0.009). Participants with no confidence in completing forms and poorer self-reported health were less likely to make an informed choice (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53–1.03; P = 0.05 and RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36–0.89; P = 0.007, respectively). Independent predictors of completing the FOBT were positive screening attitudes, receiving the standard information, preference for making the decision alone, and knowing that screening may lead to false-positive/negative results. Limitations: We did not objectively measure health literacy. Conclusions: Participants with the lowest levels of education had greater difficulties making an informed choice about participation in bowel screening. Alternative methods are needed to support informed decision making among lower education populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In this report, we present growth curve modeling (GCM) with landmark registration as an alternative statistical approach for the analysis of time series cortisol data. This approach addresses an often-ignored but critical source of variability in salivary cortisol analyses: individual and group differences in the time latency of post-stress peak concentrations. It allows for the simultaneous examination of cortisol changes before and after the peak while controlling for timing differences, and thus provides additional information that can help elucidate group differences in the underlying biological processes (e.g. intensity of response, regulatory capacity). We tested whether GCM with landmark registration is more sensitive than traditional statistical approaches (e.g. repeated measures ANOVA—rANOVA) in identifying sex differences in salivary cortisol responses to a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test—TSST) in healthy adults (mean age 23). We used plasma ACTH measures as our “standard” and show that the new approach confirms in salivary cortisol the ACTH finding that males had longer peak latencies, higher post-stress peaks but a more intense post-peak decline. This finding would have been missed if only saliva cortisol was available and only more traditional analytic methods were used. This new approach may provide neuroendocrine researchers with a highly sensitive complementary tool to examine the dynamics of the cortisol response in a way that reduces risk of false negative findings when blood samples are not feasible.

Abstract = {The constant exposure to electronic media has increased the likelihood of adolescents experiencing hurtful events such as cyberbullying. The current study examined how adolescents’ moral evaluations of cyberbullying are affected by different aspects of the event including falsity of posts, power imbalance and intention to harm. Adolescents between 12–13years of age (n =77) and 15–16years of age (n =77) read moral vignettes and were asked to evaluate the actions of the protagonist. They were also asked if the behaviour in the vignette was an incident of cyberbullying. Participants also filled out a questionnaire about their own experiences with cyberbullying. It was found that adolescents evaluated as more negative those situations depicting false stories, imbalance of power, and intention to harm; Younger children had difficulties recognizing the intentions behind on-line posts. Adolescents who have cyber-intimidated others were less severe in their evaluations and less likely to rate vignettes as cyberbullying compared to other youth.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 40(3) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance (see record [rid]2014-21050-001[/rid]). The value of the fixation duration increment, about 15 ms per 60° on simple and complex trials is erroneous. The correct value for the increment is about 7 ms per 60°. The error is found four times in the text: In the second line from the bottom of the “Abstract,” in the seventh line in the section “Integrating Local and Global Analyses of Mental Rotation,” and in the section “Concluding Remarks” 14th and 25th line from the bottom of that section.] A random walk model of the classical mental rotation task is explored in two experiments. By assuming that a mental rotation is repeated until sufficient evidence for a match/mismatch is obtained, the model accounts for the approximately linearly increasing reaction times (RTs) on positive trials, flat RTs on negative trials, false alarms and miss rates, effects of complexity, and for the number of eye movement switches between stimuli as functions of angular difference in orientation. Analysis of eye movements supports key aspects of the model and shows that initial processing time is roughly constant until the first saccade switch between stimulus objects, while the duration of the remaining trial increases approximately linearly as a function of angular discrepancy. The increment results from additive effects of (a) a linear increase in the number of saccade switches between stimulus objects, (b) a linear increase in the number of saccades on a stimulus, and (c) a linear increase in the number and in the duration of fixations on a stimulus object. The fixation duration increment was the same on simple and complex trials (about 15 ms per 60°), which suggests that the critical orientation alignment take place during fixations at very high speed.

Abstract = {This study investigates the potential clinical utility in the emergency department (ED) of an index of brain electrical activity to identify intracranial hematomas. The relationship between this index and depth, size, and type of hematoma was explored. Ten minutes of brain electrical activity was recorded from a limited montage in 38 adult patients with traumatic hematomas (CT scan positive) and 38 mild head injured controls (CT scan negative) in the ED. The volume of blood and distance from recording electrodes were measured by blinded independent experts. Brain electrical activity data were submitted to a classification algorithm independently developed traumatic brain injury (TBI) index to identify the probability of a CT + traumatic event. There was no significant relationship between the TBI-Index and type of hematoma, or distance of the bleed from recording sites. A significant correlation was found between TBI-Index and blood volume. The sensitivity to hematomas was 100%, positive predictive value was 74.5%, and positive likelihood ratio was 2.92. The TBI-Index, derived from brain electrical activity, demonstrates high accuracy for identification of traumatic hematomas. Further, this was not influenced by distance of the bleed from the recording electrodes, blood volume, or type of hematoma. Distance and volume limitations noted with other methods, (such as that based on near-infrared spectroscopy) were not found, thus suggesting the TBI-Index to be a potentially important adjunct to acute assessment of head injury. Because of the life-threatening risk of undetected hematomas (false negatives), specificity was permitted to be lower, 66%, in exchange for extremely high sensitivity.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Allen Frances and K. Dayle Jones (see record [rid]2012-20465-002[/rid]). The authors expressed concerns about the potential damage to the definition and evaluation of bipolar disorder if the duration criteria for a hypomanic episode were decreased, as well as if Criterion A for mania and hypomania was modified so that increased energy, without mood changes, would be adequate to meet criteria for a manic episode. The Work Group never advanced a proposal to decrease the required length of time for a hypomanic episode or, by extension, the severity threshold for bipolar II disorder, nor was there a proposal to change Criterion A for mania and hypomania to requiring only a change in energy. The authors of the article predicted that the Work Group's proposed changes to the DSM would lower the threshold for diagnosing bipolar disorder, increasing false positives without materially decreasing false negatives. The Work Group actually never proposed the change implied in the article that only increased energy should be required to meet episode criteria for mania, though this was certainly discussed and relevant papers reviewed. While the authors made many valid points, the article in question raises implications about the Work Group's process, priorities, and final suggestions that, if taken concretely, are simply untrue.

Abstract = {Background: Subjective memory complaints are a requirement in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as they are thought to indicate a decline in objective memory performance. However, recent research suggests that the relationship between subjective memory complaint and objective memory impairment is less clear. Thus, it is possible that many people without subjective memory complaints who develop Alzheimer's disease are precluded from a diagnosis of MCI. Methods: The present study examined the relationship between subjective memory complaint assessed using the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) and objective memory impairment assessed using standard neuropsychological measures in cases of amnestic MCI (n = 48), non-amnestic MCI (n = 27), and unimpaired healthy participants (n = 64). Results: Correlational and regression analyses indicated that subjective memory complaints displayed a poor relationship with objective memory performance. A subsequent discriminant function analysis indicated that subjective memory complaints failed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MCI and resulted in increased rates of false negative and false positive diagnoses. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that a diagnostic criterion of subjective memory complaint reduces the accuracy of MCI diagnosis, resulting in an elevated rate of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The results of this study in conjunction with recent research indicate that a criterion of subjective memory complaint should be discarded from emerging diagnostic criteria for MCI.

Abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms and life adversity have been associated with the reporting of false confessions to crime, but it is not known if these predict false confessions beyond conduct disorder. The participants were 11,388 students in further education in Iceland, who completed a questionnaire anonymously in class. Current ADHD symptoms were measured by the Barkley Current Symptom Scale. Conduct disorder was measured by the Oregon Adolescent Conduct Disorder Screen. Emotional lability was measured by items from the Symptom Check List-90. Negative life events and victimisation from group bullying were measured as indicators of life adversity. Out of 10,749 participants who provided information about interrogation and false confessions, 2104 (19.6%) reported having been interrogated at a police station as a suspect, and of those 261 (12.4%) reported having given a false confession to the police. Logistic regression showed that after controlling for gender, age and emotional lability both ADHD and negative life events predicted false confession above that of conduct disorder. The findings suggest that suspects’ resilience to resist pressure from police and peers is weakened by their condition rather than their false confession representing irresponsible and delinquent behaviour associated with conduct disorder.

Abstract = {Background: In the Netherlands, no self-report screening questionnaire for anxiety in people with intellectual disabilities (ID) was available yet. Therefore, we have translated the Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with an Intellectual Disability (GAS-ID) into Dutch and studied its reliability and validity in adults with borderline, mild or moderate ID. Method: Test–retest reliability was studied in 66 participants, convergent validity against the Anxiety sub-scale of the Hospital, Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) in 96, and criterion validity against psychiatric diagnosis in 195 participants. Results: Internal consistency was α = 0.86 and test–retest reliability ICC = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82–0.93). Correlation with the HADS-A was r = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47–0.72); sensitivity was 83.9% (95% CI: 72.2–91.2) and specificity was 51.8% (95% CI: 43.6–59.9) using a cut-off score of 17. Missed diagnoses (false-negatives) were mostly specific phobias. Of the false-positives, 38 of 66 participants (58%) had another psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusions: The Dutch version of the GAS-ID is a reliable screening instrument with satisfactory sensitivity, but moderate specificity for anxiety disorders. Although specificity for anxiety disorders is only moderate, high scores appear to be indicative of other psychiatric problems too, justifying referral for psychiatric assessment of false-positives.

Abstract = {Objective: To identify a neuroimaging signature predictive of brain amyloidosis as a screening tool to identify individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that are most likely to have high levels of brain amyloidosis or to be amyloid-free. Methods: The prediction model cohort included 62 MCI subjects screened with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ¹¹C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET). We identified an anatomical shape variation-based neuroimaging predictor of brain amyloidosis and defined a structural MRI-based brain amyloidosis score (sMRI-BAS). Amyloid beta positivity (Aβ+) predictive power of sMRI-BAS was validated on an independent cohort of 153 MCI patients with cerebrospinal fluid Aβ1–42 biomarker data but no amyloid PET scans. We compared the Aβ+ predictive power of sMRI-BAS to those of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and hippocampal volume, the 2 most relevant candidate biomarkers for the prediction of brain amyloidosis. Results: Anatomical shape variations predictive of brain amyloidosis in MCI embraced a characteristic spatial pattern known for high vulnerability to Alzheimer disease pathology, including the medial temporal lobe, temporal–parietal association cortices, posterior cingulate, precuneus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and fornix = stria terminals. Aβ+ prediction performance of sMRI-BAS and ApoE genotype jointly was significantly better than the performance of each predictor separately (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88 vs AUC = 0.70 and AUC = 0.81, respectively) with > 90% sensitivity and specificity at 20% false-positive rate and false-negative rate thresholds. Performance of hippocampal volume as an independent predictor of brain amyloidosis in MCI was only marginally better than random chance (AUC = 0.56). Interpretation: As one of the first attempts to use an imaging technique that does not require amyloid-specific radioligands for identification of individuals with brain amyloidosis, our findings could lead to development of multidisciplinary = multimodality brain amyloidosis biomarkers that are reliable, minimally invasive, and widely available.

Abstract = {Two alternative universal screening approaches to identify students with early learning difficulties were examined, along with a combination of these approaches. These approaches, consisting of (a) curriculum-based measurement (CBM) and (b) teacher ratings using Performance Screening Guides (PSGs), served as predictors of achievement tests in reading and mathematics. Participants included 413 students in grades 1, 2, and 3 in Tennessee (n = 118)and Wisconsin (n = 295) who were divided into six subsamples defined by grade and state. Reading and mathematics achievement tests with established psychometric properties were used as criteria within a concurrent and predictive validity framework. Across both achievement areas, CBM probes shared more variance with criterion measures than did teacher ratings, although teacher ratings added incremental validity among most subsamples. PSGs tended to be more accurate for identifying students in need of assistance at a 1-month interval,whereas CBM probes were more accurate at a 6-month interval. Teachers indicated that (a) false negatives are more problematic than are false positives, (b) both screening methods are useful for identifying early learning difficulties, and (c) both screening methods are useful for identifying students in need of interventions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the two types of measures, when used together, yield valuable information about students who need assistance in reading and mathematics.

Abstract = {Introduction: Diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) is supported by a suggestive clinical presentation and associated with a heterozygous contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35. State of the art: The FSHD1 phenotype has a widely variable course with great inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity. Three clinical forms can be distinguished: the classical phenotype associated with four to seven repeat units (RU) and a variable course, a severe infantile form with one to three RU, and a mild phenotype associated with borderline UR (8 to 10 RU). At the molecular level, for D4Z4 contraction to be pathogenic, it needs to occur on a specific chromosomal background, namely on the 4qA allelic variant of chromosome 4. In most cases, once FSHD is clinically suspected, the diagnosis can be genetically confirmed with a DNA test using Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes. However, diagnosis of FSHD1 remains challenging. Firstly, some patients may present with an atypical phenotype with highly focal or unusual symptoms. Secondly, there are potential pitfalls in the genetic diagnosis of FSHD resulting in false positive or false negative results. In the absence of genetic confirmation, other investigations, mainly EMG and muscle biopsy, are needed to rule out another diagnosis. In cases with no clear diagnosis and a permissive chromosome without contraction, FSHD2 may be suspected. Perspectives: Molecular combing is a new technique which permits visualization and sizing of the D4Z4 repeat array on its genetic background on stretched single DNA fibers by fluorescence microscopy. This tool will improve genetic diagnosis in FSHD patients. Conclusion: Diagnosis of FSHD1 is mainly supported by clinical features. Clinicians need to be aware of unusual presentations of this disease. The wide spectrum of intrafamilial variability and the lack of good correlation between genotype and phenotype present challenges for genetic counseling and prognostication. More studies are needed concerning penetrance and genotype–phenotype correlation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 20(1) of Psychology, Crime & Law (see record [rid]2013-43345-006[/rid]). In the original article, one of the reference was omitted. The corrections are given in the erratum.] A unique method for estimating field accuracy of the Comparison Question Test (CQT)—a polygraph technique is presented, based on a combined probabilistic and algebraic model. It is built on paired examinations in criminal cases in which two opposing versions per case have been subjected to polygraph tests. The developed model is ground-truth free, thus there was no need to rely on external criteria of deception (e.g., confessions or physical evidence) in estimating the accuracy of the CQT. Results indicate an accuracy rate of 0.94 in detecting guilty examinees (Sensitivity) with a 0.06 False Negative rate and an accuracy rate of 0.835 (Specificity) with False Positive of 0.165 for the innocents. These figures excluded 20% of the cases that were ruled inconclusive. When no inconclusive calls were allowed, the accuracy rate dropped down to 0.8 with 0.2 error rates for both the guilty and the innocent examinees. The importance of this research stems from its being a field study that due to the unique methodology was not subjected to weaknesses usually found in polygraph field validity studies. This method is applicable to other techniques of deception detection and with some necessary adaptations may be also to eyewitness situations.

Abstract = {The risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is highest with nocturnal, unattended generalized convulsions, and basic resuscitation may be able to prevent SUDEP. This study investigates an under-mattress device (ElectroMechanical Film—Emfit®) which is triggered by rhythmic motor activity of a specifiable duration, frequency, and intensity using a quasi-piezoelectric material sensitive to changes in mattress pressure. The device was tested during inpatient video-EEG monitoring. Eighteen GTCSs were recorded, 10 out of wakefulness and 8 out of sleep. Sixteen of the 18 seizures (89%) resulted in Emfit® activation with both false negative alarms occurring during wakefulness. On average, the device was activated within 9 s of onset of bilateral clonic motor movements (range: −37 to +39 s) and occurred, on average, 45 s before seizure end (range: 19 to 76 s). Only 21 false alarms were encountered, all occurring during wakefulness (PPV: 43%). The data suggest that the Emfit® detection device has a high predictive value for generalized convulsions, offers caregivers a reliable and early warning to assist the patient during convulsions, and may be a novel way to prevent SUDEP.

Abstract = {Brain fingerprinting detects concealed information stored in the brain by measuring brainwave responses. We compared P300 and P300-MERMER event-related brain potentials for error rate/accuracy and statistical confidence in four field/real-life studies. 76 tests detected presence or absence of information regarding (1) real-life events including felony crimes; (2) real crimes with substantial consequences (either a judicial outcome, i.e., evidence admitted in court, or a $100,000 reward for beating the test); (3) knowledge unique to FBI agents; and (4) knowledge unique to explosives (EOD/IED) experts. With both P300 and P300-MERMER, error rate was 0 %: determinations were 100 % accurate, no false negatives or false positives; also no indeterminates. Countermeasures had no effect. Median statistical confidence for determinations was 99.9 % with P300-MERMER and 99.6 % with P300. Brain finger-printing methods and scientific standards for laboratory and field applications are discussed. Major differences in methods that produce different results are identified. Markedly different methods in other studies have produced over 10 times higher error rates and markedly lower statistical confidences than those of these, our previous studies, and independent replications. Data support the hypothesis that accuracy, reliability, and validity depend on following the brain fingerprinting scientific standards outlined herein.

Abstract = {Two studies examined young children’s early understanding and evaluation of truth telling and lying and the role that factuality plays in their judgments. Study 1 (one hundred four 2- to 5-year-olds) found that even the youngest children reliably accepted true statements and rejected false statements and that older children’s ability to label true and false (T/F) statements as "truth" and "lie" emerged in tandem with their positive evaluation of true statements and "truth" and their negative evaluation of false statements and "lie." The findings suggest that children’s early preference for factuality develops into a conception of "truth" and "lie" that is linked both to factuality and moral evaluation. Study 2 (one hundred twenty-eight 3- to 5-year-olds) revealed that whereas young children exhibited good understanding of the association of T/F statements with "truth," "lie," "mistake," "right," and "wrong," they showed little awareness of assumptions about speaker knowledge underlying "lie" and "mistake." The results further support the primacy of factuality in children’s early understanding and evaluation of truth and lies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: The threat of a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002), both diseases of zoonotic origin, provoked interest in improving early warning systems and reinforced the need for combining data from different sources. It led to the use of search query data from search engines such as Google and Yahoo! as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. This methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of social media for disease surveillance. Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to formally assess the current state of knowledge regarding the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance in order to inform future work on early detection and more effective mitigation of the effects of foodborne illness. Methods: Structured scoping review methods were used to identify, characterize, and evaluate all published primary research, expert review, and commentary articles regarding the use of social media in surveillance of infectious diseases from 2002-2011. Results: Thirty-two primary research articles and 19 reviews and case studies were identified as relevant. Most relevant citations were peer-reviewed journal articles (29/32, 91%) published in 2010-11 (28/32, 88%) and reported use of a Google program for surveillance of influenza. Only four primary research articles investigated social media in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. Most authors (21/32 articles, 66%) reported that social media-based surveillance had comparable performance when compared to an existing surveillance program. The most commonly reported strengths of social media surveillance programs included their effectiveness (21/32, 66%) and rapid detection of disease (21/32, 66%). The most commonly reported weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32, 50%) and false negative (11/32, 34%) results. Most authors (24/32, 75%) recommended that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. Conclusions: The use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena (first reported in 2006). Both the tools themselves and the methodologies for exploiting them are evolving over time. While their accuracy, speed, and cost compare favorably with existing surveillance systems, the primary challenge is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise. Further developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve sensitivity and specificity, passively through advances in machine learning and actively through engagement of users. Adoption, even as supporting systems for existing surveillance, will entail a high level of familiarity with the tools and collaboration across jurisdictions.

@article{2013-28837-00120130619,
Abstract = {Background: Validation studies of secondary datasets used to characterize neighborhood food businesses generally evaluate how accurately the database represents the true situation on the ground. Depending on the research objectives, the characterization of the business environment may tolerate some inaccuracies (e.g. minor imprecisions in location or errors in business names). Furthermore, if the number of false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs) is balanced within a given area, one could argue that the database still provides a “fair” representation of existing resources in this area. Yet, traditional validation measures do not relax matching criteria, and treat FNs and FPs independently. Through the field validation of food businesses found in a Canadian database, this paper proposes alternative criteria for validity. Methods: Field validation of the 2010 Enhanced Points of Interest (EPOI) database (DMTI Spatial®) was performed in 2011 in 12 census tracts (CTs) in Montreal, Canada. Some 410 food outlets were extracted from the database and 484 were observed in the field. First, traditional measures of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) accounting for every single mismatch between the field and the database were computed. Second, relaxed measures of sensitivity and PPV that tolerate mismatches in business names or slight imprecisions in location were assessed. A novel measure of representativity that further allows for compensation between FNs and FPs within the same business category and area was proposed. Representativity was computed at CT level as ((TPs +|FPs-FNs|)/(TPs+FNs)), with TPs meaning true positives, and |FPs-FNs| being the absolute value of the difference between the number of FNs and the number of FPs within each outlet category. Results: The EPOI database had a "moderate" capacity to detect an outlet present in the field (sensitivity: 54.5%) or to list only the outlets that actually existed in the field (PPV: 64.4%). Relaxed measures of sensitivity and PPV were respectively 65.5% and 77.3%. The representativity of the EPOI database was 77.7%. Conclusions: The novel measure of representativity might serve as an alternative to traditional validity measures, and could be more appropriate in certain situations, depending on the nature and scale of the research question.

Abstract = {Background: Screening with mammography has the ability to detect breast cancer at an early stage but misses some cancers. Supporters of adjunct ultrasonography to the screening regimen argue that it might be a safe and inexpensive approach to reduce the false-negative rates of screening. Critics are concerned that adjunct ultrasonography will also increase the rate of false-positive findings and can lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments in women at average risk. Aims: The purpose of this review was to systematically assess the comparative benefits and harms of mammography with adjunct breast ultrasonography and mammography only in breast cancer screening. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases and the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group’s Specialised Register (from 1995 to February 2012). To detect ongoing or unpublished studies, we searched trial registries and multiple sources of grey literature. Two researchers independently reviewed all abstracts and full-text articles against predefined eligibility criteria. We dually rated the risk of bias of studies and the strength of evidence based on established guidance. Results: We did not detect any controlled studies that provide evidence for (or against) the use of adjunct ultrasonography for screening in women at average risk for breast cancer. Extrapolations of results from women at elevated risk for breast cancer indicate that the false-positive rates in women at average risk who were recalled because of positive ultrasonographies will exceed 98%. In women with dense or very dense breast tissue, the evidence regarding the use of adjunct ultrasonography is not conclusive. Conclusions: No methodologically sound evidence is available justifying the routine use of ultrasonography as an adjunct screening tool in women at average risk for breast cancer. Implications for practice: Clinicians should not use ultrasonography as a screening tool for breast cancer screening on a routine basis. The use should be limited to women with dense breasts for whom the accuracy of mammography is low, or for diagnostic purposes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

@article{2013-41439-00420131001,
Abstract = {Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) can be reliably elicited in response to speech stimuli in listeners wearing hearing aids. It is unclear, however, how close to the aided behavioral threshold (i.e., at what behavioral sensation level) a sound must be before a cortical response can reliably be detected. , Purpose: The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the relationship between CAEP detection and the audibility of speech sounds (as measured behaviorally), when the listener is wearing a hearing aid fitted to prescriptive targets. A secondary aim was to investigate whether CAEP detection is affected by varying the frequency emphasis of stimuli, so as to simulate variations to the prescribed gain-frequency response of a hearing aid. The results have direct implications for the evaluation of hearing aid fittings in nonresponsive adult clients, and indirect implications for the evaluation of hearing aid fittings in infants. Research Design: Participants wore hearing aids while listening to speech sounds presented in a sound field. Aided thresholds were measured, and cortical responses evoked, under a range of stimulus conditions. The presence or absence of CAEPs was determined by an automated statistic. Study Sample: Participants were adults (6 females and 4 males). Participants had sensorineural hearing loss ranging from mild to severe-profound in degree. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants' own hearing aids were replaced with a test hearing aid, with linear processing, during assessments. Pure-tone thresholds and hearing aid gain measurements were obtained, and a theoretical prediction of speech stimulus audibility for each participant (similar to those used for audibility predictions in infant hearing aid fittings) was calculated. Three speech stimuli, (/m/, /t/, and /g/) were presented aided (monaurally, nontest ear occluded), free field, under three conditions (+ 4 dB/octave, -4 dB/octave, and without filtering), at levels of 40, 50, and 60 dB SPL (measured for the unfiltered condition). Behavioral thresholds were obtained, and CAEP recordings were made using these stimuli. The Interaction of hearing loss, presentation levels, and filtering conditions resulted in a range of CAEP test behavioral sensation levels (SLs), from -25 to +40 dB. Results: Statistically significant CAEPs (p < .05) were obtained for virtually every presentation where the behavioral sensation level was > 10 dB, and for only 5% of occasions when the sensation level was negative. In these ("false-positive") cases, the greatest (negative) sensation level at which a CAEP was judged to be present was -6 dB SL. Conclusions: CAEPs are a sensitive tool for directly evaluating the audibility of speech sounds, at least for adult listeners. CAEP evaluation was found to be more accurate than audibility predictions, based on threshold and hearing aid response measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Occupational exposure to toxic solvents increases the odds for having Parkinson’s disease (PD). We performed a door-to-door survey to assess PD prevalence in Atahualpa, a rural village of coastal Ecuador where more than 50 %of men work as carpenters, being in contact with toxic solvents under poor safety settings. During Phase I, rural doctors screened all Atahualpa residents aged ≥40 years with a questionnaire directed to identify those with PD. In Phase II, neurologists evaluated individuals who screened as suspected cases of PD, as well as a random sample of negative individuals to assess possible false negative cases.As a result, the census yielded 642 Atahualpa residents aged ≥40 years. An affirmative response to the questionnaire was obtained in seven persons. Neurological examination confirmed the diagnosis of PD in two of them (both carpenters). Examination of 14 non-suspected individuals disclosed no further PD patients. Prevalence of PD in Atahualpa residents aged ≥40 years was 312 per 100,000 which increased to 671 per 100,000 when only people aged ≥60 years was considered. Job-specific prevalence was 1,470 per 100,000 in carpenters. In conclusions, PD prevalence in Atahualpa is similar to that reported from other regions. However, we noted an increase in PD prevalence when only carpenters were considered. Unsafe occupational exposure to toxic substances may counterbalance the apparently lower risk of PD in the non-industrialized world. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The present study examined the impact of divided attention on children's and adults' neutral and negative true and false memories in a standard Deese/Roediger–McDermott paradigm. Children (7- and 11-year-olds; n = 126) and adults (n = 52) received 5 neutral and 5 negative Deese/Roediger–McDermott word lists; half of each group also received a divided attention task. The results showed that divided attention affected children's and adults' false memory levels differently but did not alter true memory differently. Our results revealed a developmental shift in that divided attention lowered children's false memory rates but increased adults' false memory rates, regardless of the nature of the material (i.e., neutral or negative). Our study indicates that manipulations that target conscious processing (e.g., divided attention) result in marked qualitative and quantitative differences between children's and adults' false memories but not true memories.

Abstract = {In judicial terms, a victim refers to any person who has suffered injury arising from an action or omission of an action that constitutes an offence, and the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. A review of Spanish judicial judgements underscored that the lack of evidence of psychological injury in cases of intimate-partner violence (IPV) accounted for approximately 40% of acquittals. Thus, the Spanish standard of proof for the forensic evaluation of psychological injury i.e., the MMPI-2 and the unstructured interview were assessed in order to determine if they met the statutory requirement for the assessment of psychological injury and the differential diagnosis of feigning. The results of the comparison of 51 women victims of IPV with firm convictions against their aggressors, and 54 women mock victims of IPV showed that the F, K, Fb, Fp and Ds scales, and the F-K index discriminated significantly and with medium and large effect sizes, between adjudicated and mock victims. However, the results did not provide a valid decision criterion for forensic settings i.e., false negatives (identifying feigner as honest protocols) were not classified correctly. In conclusion, the standard forensic procedure for the evaluation of psychological injury in cases of IPV did not constitute valid proof for judges who acquitted defendants on the grounds of not proven due to the lack of evidence of psychological injury.

Abstract = {Though it is widely recognized that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) face significant health disparities, the comprehensive data sets needed for population-level health surveillance of people with IDD are lacking. This paucity of data makes it difficult to track and accurately describe health differences, improvements, and changes in access. Many states maintain administrative health databases that, to date, have not been widely used for research purposes. In order to evaluate the feasibility of using administrative databases for research purposes, the authors attempted to validate Massachusetts' administrative health database by comparing it to a large safety net hospital system's patient data regarding cancer screening, and to the state's service enrollment tables. The authors found variable representativeness overall; the sub-population of adults who live in 24-hr supported residences were better represented than adults who live independently or with family members. They also found a fairly low false negative rate for cancer screening data as compared with the "gold standard" of hospital records. Despite some limitations, these results suggest that state-level administrative databases may represent an exciting new avenue for health research. These results should lend context to efforts to study cancer and health screening variables using administrative databases. The present study methods may also have utility to researchers in other states for critically evaluating other state IDD service databases. This type of evaluation can assist researchers in contextualizing their data, and in tailoring their research questions to the abilities and limitations of this kind of database.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of statutory health assessments in identifying existing mental health disorders in pre-school foster children. It was examined whether a foster carer completed screening instrument could enhance accuracy. A representative sample of 43 pre-schoolers under the care of one inner-city local authority underwent comprehensive multidimensional mental health assessments as the reference standard. Statutory health assessments gave false negative results for 65% (95% confidence interval (CI) 44–82%) of children diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder according to the reference standard and 18% (95% CI 3–52%) of children with developmental delay. The Ages & Stages Questionnaire completed by the foster carers failed to identify 65% (95% CI 44–82%) of the children with diagnosed mental health disorders. There was no evidence of selective underreporting by foster carers in relation to specific diagnostic categories. In conclusion, statutory health assessments in their current form may fail to identify the majority of pre-school foster children with mental health disorders. Adding a screening instrument to the assessment process may not be adequate to improve diagnostic accuracy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Because Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been a false negative in rat intravenous self-administration procedures, the evaluation of the abuse potential of candidate cannabinoid medications has proved difficult. One lab group has successfully trained self-administration of the aminoalkylindole WIN55,212-2 in rats; however, their results have not been independently replicated. The purpose of this study was to extend their model by using a within-subjects design, with the goal of establishing a robust method suitable for substitution testing of other cannabinoids. Male Long–Evans rats were trained to self-administer WIN55,212-2 (0.01mg/kg/infusion) on a fixed ratio 3 schedule. Dose–effect curves for WIN55,212-2 were determined, followed by vehicle substitution and a dose–effect curve with THC. WIN55,212-2 self-administration was acquired; however, substitution with THC did not maintain responding above vehicle levels. Dose-dependent attenuation by rimonabant confirmed CB₁ receptor mediation of WIN55,212-2's reinforcing effects. Vehicle substitution resulted in a session-dependent decrease in responding (i.e., extinction). While this study provides systematic replication of previous studies, lack of substitution with THC is problematic and suggests that WIN55,212-2 self-administration may be of limited usefulness as a screening tool for detection of the reinforcing effects of potential cannabinoid medications. Clarification of underlying factors responsible for failure of THC to maintain self-administration in cannabinoid-trained rats is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: "Patient activation" describes the extent to which individuals manage their own healthcare. This study evaluated the association of patient activation, depressive symptoms and quality of life in a primary care setting. Methods: 278 patients who visited two primary care clinics were interviewed in the waiting room before their appointment or by telephone. Study participants completed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12). Physicians assessed each participant’s depression status immediately after the visit. Results: PAM scores correlated negatively with PHQ-9 (r = -0.35, p < 0.0001) and positively with total SF-12 score (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001). Increased participant involvement by one-level increments on the PAM was predicted by their being in the 55 to 74-year age group and higher total SF-12 quartiles. Almost half of those scoring ≥ 10 on PHQ-9 were not considered depressed by their physician (false negatives, i.e. "hidden depression"). Conclusion: In primary care settings, PAM is easily administered and useful for general patients and for those with depressive symptoms. Practice implications: Assessing patient activation will enable caregivers to monitor levels of self-care (activation) and potential adherence to health behavior recommendations. PHQ-9 screening could increase awareness of "hidden depression" in the primary care setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the standard error of measurement (SEM) can be used as an additional "safety net" to reduce the frequency of false‐positive or false‐negative student grading classifications. Practical examinations in clinical anatomy are often used as diagnostic tests to admit students to course final examinations. The aim of this study was to explore the diagnostic value of SEM using the likelihood ratio (LR) in establishing decisions about students with practical examination scores at or below the pass/fail cutoff score in a clinical anatomy course. Two hundred sixty‐seven students took three clinical anatomy practical examinations in 2011. The students were asked to identify 40 anatomical structures in images and prosected specimens in the practical examination. Practical examination scores were then divided according to the following cutoff scores: 2, 1 SEM below, and 0, 1, 2 SEM above the pass score. The positive predictive value (+ PV) and LR of passing the final examination were estimated for each category to explore the diagnostic value of practical examination scores. The + PV (LR) in the six categories defined by the SEM was 39.1% (0.08), 70.0% (0.30), 88.9% (1.04), 91.7% (1.43), 95.8% (3.00), and 97.8% (5.74), respectively. The LR of categories 2 SEM above/below the pass score generated a moderate/large shift in the pre‐ to post‐test probability of passing. The LR increased the usefulness and practical value of SEM by improving confidence in decisions about the progress of students with borderline scores 2 SEM above/below the pass score in practical examinations in clinical anatomy courses.

Abstract = {Mitochondrial diseases are a diverse group of inherited and acquired disorders that result in inadequate energy production. They can be caused by inheritable genetic mutations, acquired somatic mutations, and exposure to toxins (including some prescription medications). Normal mitochondrial physiology is responsible, in part, for the aging process itself, as free radical production within the mitochondria results in a lifetime burden of oxidative damage to DNA, especially the mitochondrial DNA that, in turn, replicate the mutational burden in future copies of itself, and lipid membranes. Primary mitochondrial diseases are those caused by mutations in genes that encode for mitochondrial structural and enzymatic proteins, and those proteins required for mitochondrial assembly and maintenance. A number of common adult maladies are associated with defective mitochondrial energy production and function, including diabetes, obesity, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been demonstrated in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and some cancers. Polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to disease susceptibility, including death from sepsis and survival after head injury. There is considerable overlap in symptoms caused by primary mitochondrial diseases and those illnesses that affect mitochondrial function, but are not caused by primary mutations, as well as disorders that mimic mitochondrial diseases, but are caused by other identified mutations. Evaluation of these disorders is complex, expensive, and not without false-negative and false-positive results that can mislead the physician. Most of the common heritable mitochondrial disorders have been well-described in the literature, but can be overlooked by many clinicians if they are uneducated about these disorders. In general, the evaluation of the classic mitochondrial disorders has become straightforward if the clinician recognized the phenotype and orders appropriate confirmatory testing. However, the majority of patients referred for a mitochondrial evaluation do not have a clear presentation that allows for rapid identification and testing. This article provides introductory comments on mitochondrial structure, physiology, and genetics, but will focus on the presentation and evaluation of adults with mitochondrial symptoms, but who may not have a primary mitochondrial disease.

Abstract = {Purpose: Cancer screening programs have the potential of intended beneficial effects, but they also inevitably have unintended harmful effects. In the case of screening mammography, the most frequent harm is a false-positive result. Prior efforts to measure their psychosocial consequences have been limited by short-term follow-up, the use of generic survey instruments, and the lack of a relevant benchmark—women with breast cancer. Methods: In this cohort study with a 3-year follow-up, we recruited 454 women with abnormal findings in screening mammography over a 1-year period. For each woman with an abnormal finding on a screening mammogram (false and true positives), we recruited another 2 women with normal screening results who were screened the same day at the same clinic. These participants were asked to complete the Consequences of Screening in Breast Cancer—a validated questionnaire encompassing 12 psychosocial outcomes—at baseline, 1, 5, 18, and 36 months. Results: Six months after final diagnosis, women with false-positive findings reported changes in existential values and inner calmness as great as those reported by women with a diagnosis of breast cancer (Δ = 1.15; P = .015; and Δ = 0.13; P = .423, respectively). Three years after being declared free of cancer, women with false-positive results consistently reported greater negative psychosocial consequences compared with women who had normal findings in all 12 psychosocial outcomes (Δ > 0 for 12 of 12 outcomes; P <.01 for 4 of 12 outcomes). Conclusion: False-positive findings on screening mammography causes long-term psychosocial harm: 3 years after a false-positive finding, women experience psychosocial consequences that range between those experienced by women with a normal mammogram and those with a diagnosis of breast cancer.

Abstract = {In this paper, we address the difficult task of moving objects segmentation and matting in dynamic scenes. Toward this end, we propose a new automatic way to integrate a background subtraction (BGS) and an alpha matting technique via a heuristic seeds selection scheme. Specifically, our method can be divided into three main steps. First, we use a novel BGS method as attention mechanisms, generating many possible foreground pixels by tuning it for low false-positives and false-negatives as much as possible. Second, a connected components algorithm is used to give the bounding boxes of the labeled foreground pixels. Finally, matting of the object associated to a given bounding box is performed using a heuristic seeds selection scheme. This matting task is guided by top-down knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by C-H Tu et al. (see record [rid]2014-19001-001[/rid]). Screening for depression among cancer patients is not without controversy. Resolving this controversy depends on data being obtained and reported in as rigorous and transparent a manner as possible. Tu et al. concluded that their data support screening among Taiwanese cancer patients to improve detection of depressive disorders. Moreover, they argue for a specific cut point on the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ) for use in this population. Tu et al. should be applauded for the transparency with which their data are presented, but readers should carefully examine their method, data, and analytic strategy before accepting their conclusions. The analysis by Tu et al. excludes all those who initially screened negative as well as almost 73% of those who screened positive. Diagnostic interviews were not performed for any negative screens, and no attempt was made to demonstrate a lack of bias among those who screened positive and made it through the interview procedure. Tu et al. reported that the TDQ was set such that false negatives were unlikely but provide no data to support this. Given the available data, most test characteristics cannot be calculated without extremely tenuous assumptions being made, such as perfect performance for negative screens and no biases in the selection of the minority of positive screens who went on to complete an interview. These data simply do not allow conclusions about either diagnostic accuracy or appropriate cut points to be drawn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Stephen H. Allnutt et al. (see record [rid]2013-27658-008[/rid]). In a recent paper, Allnutt urge clinicians to base violence risk assessment on ‘empirical knowledge’ in order to ‘inform appropriate management interventions to reduce the identified risk’. However, the paper does not address the concerns of many general psychiatrists about the effect on clinical decision-making of the various types of risk assessment that have crept into mainstream psychiatry. These concerns include the lack of evidence that performing a risk assessment can bring about a reduction in the overall level of harm, the effect of high rates of both false positive and false negative findings. The paper claims that the research regarding the use of risk assessment in clinical practice is ‘promising’. In fact there is almost no evidence that the routine application of risk assessment has ever prevented any form of harm and the surprisingly few studies of the outcomes of clinical decisions based on various types of risk assessment show no effect from risk assessment itself. The paper states that the ‘ultimate goal is to manage specific populations of patients with an increased propensity for any violence’. The paper mainly discusses violence risk assessment. However, the prevention of suicide is arguably of greater concern to general mental health services, given the far higher rates of suicide compared to lethal violence. Another issue that is not covered in the paper is the ethical problem arising from performing risk assessments on patients without their full knowledge or consent. The authors acknowledge the problem of attempting to predict rare serious adverse events and the ‘limited investigation’ of the application of risk assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract = {Background: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), is a categorical system that provides descriptive diagnostic criteria for psychiatric syndromes. These syndrome descriptions are imperfect representations of an underlying behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction; thus, the criteria could be conceptualized as a type of test for the etiologically defined illnesses. Accordingly, as with any other diagnostic test, diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria produce some false positive and some false negative results. That is, some patients who meet the criteria will not have the illness (ie, false positives), and some who do not meet the criteria because their symptoms fall below the diagnostic threshold will have the illness and incorrectly not receive the diagnosis (ie, false negatives). In this context, I consider the controversy over whether the diagnostic threshold for bipolar disorder should be lowered. Method: Longitudinal studies of the prognostic significance of subthreshold bipolar disorder are considered. Results: Subthreshold bipolarity is a risk factor for the future emergence of bipolar disorder, but the majority of individuals with subthreshold bipolarity do not develop a future manic or hypomanic episode. Conclusions: The diagnostic threshold for bipolar disorder should not be lowered for 4 reasons: (1) the results of longitudinal studies suggest that lowering the diagnostic threshold for bipolar disorder will result in a greater increase in false positive than true positive diagnoses; (2) there are no controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy of mood stabilizers in treating subthreshold bipolar disorder; (3) if a false negative diagnosis occurs and bipolar disorder is underdiagnosed, diagnosis and treatment can be changed when a manic/hypomanic episode emerges; and (4) if bipolar disorder is overdiagnosed and patients are inappropriately prescribed a mood stabilizer, the absence of a future manic/hypomanic episode would incorrectly be considered evidence of the efficacy of treatment, and the unnecessary medications that might cause medically significant side effects would not be discontinued.

Abstract = {Study Objectives: Compare automatic event detection (AED) of respiratory events using a positive airway pressure (PAP) device with manual scoring of polysomnography (PSG) during PAP treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Design: Prospective PSGs of patients using a PAP device. Setting: Six academic and private sleep disorders centers. Patients: A total of 148 PSGs from 115 participants with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15 events/hr) were analyzed. Interventions: A signal generated by the PAP device identifying the AED of respiratory events based on airflow was recorded during PSG. Measurements and Results: The PSGs were manually scored without visualization of the AED signal and scoring of a hypopnea required a ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation. The apnea index (AI), hypopnea index (HI), and AHI by manual score and PAP AED were compared. A customized computer program compared individual events by manual scoring and AED to determine the true positive, false positive, false negative, or true negative events and found a sensitivity of 0.58 and a specificity of 0.98. The AHI, AI, and HI by the two methods were highly correlated. Bland-Altman analysis showed better agreement for AI than HI. Using a manually scored AHI of ≥ 10 events/hr to denote inadequate treatment, an AED AHI ≥ 10 events/hr had a sensitivity of 0.58 and a specificity of 0.94. Conclusions: An AHI < 10 events/hr by PAP AED is usually associated with good treatment efficacy. Differences between manually scored and AED events were primarily due to different criteria for hypopnea detection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Rakusa et al. presented and assessed a dipstick algorithm for urinary tract infections (UTI) prior to initiation of corticosteroid therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who experience relapse. The outcomes of this prospective study consisted of determination of urinary tract dipstick sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value as well as safety of antibiotic therapy along with corticosteroid treatment of MS relapse. On the basis of the results of this study, 11% of the study participants had significant bacteriuria with calculated specificity and sensitivity values for dipstick performance of 78% and 75%, respectively. Negative predictive value of urine dipstick was 96%. Neither the 3% of patients with false negative dipstick nor the 18% false positive patients who were unnecessarily treated with antibiotics for 48 h had any clinical adverse events. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm based on utilizing urinary dipstick testing allows for more rapid and safer management of UTIs in MS patients with acute relapses. This algorithm possesses significant practical use for clinicians and assists them to reach diagnostic decisions and select the appropriate therapy earlier in the course of MS relapse.

Abstract = {Objective: JC virus (JCV) seropositivity is a risk factor for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients on natalizumab. Accordingly, the JCV serological antibody test is of paramount importance in determining disease risk. Methods: We tested the accuracy of the JCV serum antibody test by comparing the results of JCV serology to JCV viruria and viremia in 67 patients enrolled in a single-center, retrospective cohort study. Bodily fluids (urine and blood) were assessed for JCV DNA by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 6 to 47 months (mean = 26.1 months) before JCV antibody testing. In 10 individuals, blood and urine samples were obtained on 2 separate occasions at 6-month intervals. Results: Forty (59.7%) of the 67 patients were JCV seropositive. Of 27 JCV seronegative patients, 10 (37%) had JCV viruria. Urine JCV DNA copy numbers were significantly higher in the seropositive group (mean log copy number = 5.93, range = 1.85–9.21) than the seronegative group (mean log copy number = 2.41, range = 1.85–5.43; p = 0.0026). Considering all body fluid test results, 50 (74.6%) of the 67 patients were previously infected with JCV. Interpretation: The false-negative rate of the JCV serology in this study was 37%; therefore, JCV serostatus does not appear to identify all patients infected with JCV. Thus, a negative JCV antibody result should not be conflated with absence of JCV infection. This discordance may be important in understanding JCV biology, risk for PML, and PML pathogenesis.

Abstract = {There is a growing body of research suggesting that the first trial of the TOMM may provide an accurate screener of effort in children. During neuropsychological assessments, some circumstances result in only one completed trial of the TOMM. Research on adults reflects that passing scores on Trial 1 (based on Trial 2 cutoff) are highly predictive of passing scores on Trial 2 and the TOMM overall. Pediatric research found that 100% of children and adolescents who passed Trial 1 of the TOMM also passed Trial 2. Our research hypothesis is that children who pass Trial 1 will also pass Trial 2. Data from 75 clinically diagnosed children (ages 6–18 years) found that 64% performed above the published adult TOMM cutoff on Trial 1. All children who passed Trial 1 also passed Trial 2 suggesting support for the research hypothesis. Sensitivity was 1.0, specificity was 0.72, positive predictive value was .33, and negative predictive value was 1.0. These findings suggest that in this sample, the children who performed above the Trial 2 cutoff on Trial 1 also all passed Trial 2 (so there were no false negatives, thus a perfect sensitivity and negative predictive value). Of the 36% of children who did not pass the Trial 1 cutoff, 67% passed on Trial 2. Data clearly support that children passing Trial 1 have a high likelihood of passing Trial 2, thus drawing conclusions about performance validity after passing Trial 1. Conclusions after failing Trial 1 require further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Community involvement is increasingly identified as a "critical enabler" of an effective HIV/AIDS response. We explore pathways between community participation and HIV prevention, treatment and impact mitigation in Zimbabwe, reviewing six qualitative studies in Manicaland. These find that community group membership is often (not always) associated with decreased HIV incidence, reduced stigma and improved access to some services, particularly amongst women. Participation in formal community groups (e.g., church or women’s groups) and informal local networks (e.g., neighbours, families) provides opportunities for critical dialogue about HIV/AIDS, often facilitating renegotiation of harmful social norms, sharing of previously hidden personal experiences of HIV/AIDS, formulation of positive action plans and solidarity to action them. However, implementation of new plans and insights is constrained by poverty, social uncertainty and poor service delivery. Furthermore, dialogue may have negative effects, spreading false information and entrenching negative norms. The extent that formal groups and informal networks facilitate externally imposed HIV/AIDS interventions varies. They potentially provide vital practical and emotional support, facilitating service access, treatment adherence and AIDS care. However, they may sometimes play a negative role in prevention activities, challenging stereotypes about sexuality or gender. There is an urgent need for greater recognition of the role of indigenous community groups and networks, and the inclusion of "strengthening local responses" as a key element of interventions and policy. Such efforts require great sensitivity. Heavy-handed external interference in complex indigenous relationships risks undermining the localism and bottom-up initiative and activism that might be central to their effectiveness. Cautious efforts might seek to enhance the potentially beneficial effects of groups, especially for women, and limit potentially damaging ones, especially for men. Efforts should be made to facilitate contexts that enable groups to have beneficial effects, through nesting them within wider comprehensive responses, and supporting them through strong partnerships with service providers.

Abstract = {Objective: A study was undertaken to define the prevalence of anti‐JC virus (JCV) antibodies in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to evaluate the analytical false‐negative rate of a 2‐step anti‐JC virus antibody assay. Methods: STRATIFY‐1 is an ongoing, longitudinal, observational study of relapsing MS patients in the United States who are being treated or considering treatment with natalizumab. Baseline serum and plasma samples were collected for anti‐JC virus antibody detection using an analytically validated, 2‐step, virus‐like particle‐based enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Urine was collected for JC virus DNA detection. Results: At baseline (n = 1,096), overall anti‐JC virus antibody prevalence was 56.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.0‐59.0) in STRATIFY‐1 patients, with an assay false‐negative rate of 2.7% (95% CI, 0.9–6.2). Prevalence was significantly lower in females (53.4%; 95% CI, 49.9–56.8) than males (64.3%; 95% CI, 58.2–70.0) and increased with age, p = 0.0019 and p = 0.0001, respectively. Prevalence was similar in patients regardless of natalizumab exposure or prior immunosuppressant use, p = 0.9709 and p = 0.6632, respectively. STRATIFY‐1 results were generally consistent with those observed in another large North American cohort, TYGRIS‐US (n = 1,480). Interpretation: Baseline results from STRATIFY‐1 are consistent with other studies utilizing this assay that demonstrate a 50 to 60% prevalence of anti‐JC virus antibodies, a low false‐negative rate, and an association of increasing age and male gender with increasing anti‐JC virus antibody prevalence. Neither natalizumab exposure nor prior immunosuppressant use appear to affect prevalence. Longitudinal data from STRATIFY‐1 will confirm the stability of anti‐JC virus antibody prevalence over time.

Abstract = {Objective: Screening for cervical cancer may have favourable or unfavourable effects at the individual level. This study assesses whether invitees in the Netherlands made an informed choice about screen uptake. Methods: Attached to the invitation letter and the information leaflet, screen invitees were sent a questionnaire. An informed decision was defined as based on decision-relevant knowledge, while the woman’s attitude was consistent with her actual screening behaviour. Results: Of all cervical screen participants, 60% (924/1551) responded to the questionnaire. Decision-relevant knowledge was sufficient in 595 women. Especially knowledge about false-positive and false-negative test results was limited. The attitude towards cervical screening was mainly positive (99%). Requirements for informed decision making were met in 571 (68%) women and in 91% when an alternative cut-off point of sufficient decision-relevant knowledge was applied. Most frequently reported main reasons to attend were early detection of abnormalities (67%) and reassurance in case of a normal smear (22%). Conclusion: Insufficient decision-relevant knowledge was the main cause of uninformed attendance. Practice implication: Adequate strategies to provide invitees with sufficient decision-relevant information are still needed, especially regarding false-positive and false-negative test results (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Child protection systems appear to be in a continual crisis of confidence. They get criticised for not doing enough to protect some children, whilst at the same time being criticised for being too intrusive or not managing demand. This constant balancing act drives almost continual reforms, none of which appear to reduce further crises of confidence. The central issue facing tertiary child protection systems stems from their function as makers of sometimes highly uncertain risk screening decisions. Uncertainty leads to errors; false positives and false negatives. Two recurring issues challenging child protection agencies are concerns about these errors. Fears about doing too much are concerns about false positives and fears of doing too little are concerns about false negatives. The need to address both issues within the context of uncertain high stakes decision making, in a highly risk intolerant environment leads to poorly formed sentinel event driven policy that in turn leads to organisational fragility. A decision outcome-based performance model based on Signal Detection Theory provides indicators that explicitly outline the link between these two strategic issues facing child protection systems. This has improved dialogue, understanding and support from sponsors. It has led an informed focus on improving decision making and stabilisation of decision thresholds. It demonstrates that Child protection systems are in fact very responsive and do perform well in their decision making (risk screening) function. Social work decision makers provide value in their decision making in spite of highly uncertain decisions to make. Child protection systems do not need reform, they need to be “reframed” to better understand true performance and so avoid poorly informed reactive policy responses to the genuine challenges that they face.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Terje Aven (see record [rid]2011-23960-003[/rid]). The author's reflections on different kinds of uncertainty demonstrate the need for crystal-clear conceptual and methodological thinking. Aven alternatively proposes that it is the difficulty of establishing an accurate prediction model for the occurrence of serious loss that should be the basis for precautionary risk management. This seems to imply that “risk” (when uncertain) is not so much a function of probability and negative outcome, but rather a characteristic of the process or scenario—as modeled—about serious negative consequences. The PP need not be considered as something (a basic attitude) requiring a particular, well-tuned. Precaution normally is and should be triggered by the credible possibility of serious negative consequences, whatever the associated benefits are. Hence, to finalize: risk involves more than uncertainty, which is not the same as probability, which is a degree of belief that may also be based on relative frequency information and that should be one of the pillars of your outcome prediction model, which should also include human coping potential, whereby false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) should be carefully balanced.

Abstract = {On belief–desire reasoning tasks, children first pass tasks involving true belief before those involving false belief, and tasks involving positive desire before those involving negative desire. The current study examined belief–desire reasoning in participants old enough to pass all such tasks. Eighty-three 6- to 11-year-olds and 20 adult participants completed simple, computer-based tests of belief–desire reasoning, which recorded response times as well as error rates. Both measures suggested that, like young children, older children and adults find it more difficult to reason about false belief and negative desires than true beliefs and positive desires. It is argued that this developmental continuity is most consistent with either executive competence or executive performance accounts of the development of belief–desire reasoning.

Abstract = {Background: Diagnostic criteria and procedures for dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) have been proposed by a Movement Disorders Society Task Force (MDS-TF). The objective of this study was to explore the utility of the new MDS-TF criteria and procedures in clinical practice. Methods: Two hundred ninety nine PD patients (36.5% with PDD as per MDFS-TF criteria; 33.1% according the DSM-IV) were included in the study. A variety of standardized motor, cognitive, psychiatric, and global severity measures were administered. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to determine the variables producing discrepancy between the MDS-TF and DSM-IV criteria for PDD and the clinical features that distinguished false negative cases. Results: Agreement between MDS-TF and DSM-IV criteria was substantial (87.3%; kappa = 0.72), but the DSM-IV criteria failed to identify 22% of patients fulfilling MDS-TF criteria. False negative cases were older and had more severe motor symptoms but less psychosis than those true non-demented PD. False positives had less severe motor symptoms than true PDD, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the MDS-TF criteria are more sensitive than the DSM-IV for a diagnosis of PDD. Old age, absence of psychiatric symptoms, and severe motor impairment can hinder the diagnosis of PDD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Patient trust in medical decision makers is a crucial facilitator of effective health care. Greater patient involvement in decision making requires improved understanding of how such trust is built, maintained, and lost in medical contexts. Objective: The study investigates how trust in clinicians is affected by the 4 main diagnostic outcomes proposed by signal detection theory: true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Cognitive appraisals of, and affective reactions to, the decisions were measured to investigate the psychological mechanisms underpinning effects on trust. Design: Members of an Internet research panel (N = 1162) participated in a between-participant experimental study using hypothetical cancer diagnosis scenarios. Results: Overall, correct diagnoses bolstered trust as much as incorrect ones undermined it. Consistent with recent findings in other decision-making domains, trust was not as precarious as generally believed. The influence of decisions and outcomes on trust was mediated through cognitive assessments and affective responses in line with current appraisal theories in psychology. Prior levels of trust in clinicians affected sympathy for doctors, highlighting the role that trust plays in responding to new information. Conclusions: Trust in (hypothetical) clinicians is sensitive to information about their past diagnostic performance. Greater understanding of the cognitive and affective mechanisms by which this occurs may help maintain current high levels of trust. Further research is needed to examine whether findings generalize to real medical decision-making contexts. Clinicians may want to consider the impact their diagnoses have on trust alongside medical and financial considerations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: There are high rates of mental disorder in correctional environments, so effective mental health screening is needed. Implementation of the computerised mental health screen of the Correctional Service of Canada has led to improved identification of offenders with mental health needs but with high rates of false positives. Aims: The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of an iterative classification tree (ICT) approach to mental health screening compared with a simple binary approach using cut-off scores on screening tools. Methods: A total of 504 consecutive admissions to federal prison completed the screen and were also interviewed by a mental health professional. Relationships between screening results and more extended assessment and clinical team discussion were tested. Results: The ICT was more parsimonious in identifying probable ‘cases’ than standard binary screening. ICT was also highly accurate at detecting mental health needs (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI 0.84–0.90). The model identified 118 (23.4%) offenders as likely to need further assessment or treatment, 87% of whom were confirmed cases at clinical interview. Of the 244 (48.4%) offenders who were screened out, only 9% were clinically assessed as requiring further assessment or treatment. Standard binary screening was characterised by more false positives and a comparable false negative rate. Conclusions: The use of ICTs to interpret screening data on the mental health of prisoners needs further evaluation in independent samples in Canada and elsewhere. This first evaluation of the application of such an approach offers the prospect of more effective and efficient use of the scarce resource of mental health services in prisons. Although not required, the use of computers can increase the ease of implementing an ICT model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the accuracy of reporting do not resuscitate (DNR) orders in administrative data for use in risk-adjusted hospital assessments. We compared DNR reporting by 48 California hospitals in 2005 patient discharge data (PDD) with gold-standard assessments made by registered nurses (RNs) who reabstracted 1,673 records of patients with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or heart failure. The PDD agreed with the RN reabstraction in 1,411 (84.3%) cases. The administrative data did not reflect a DNR order in 71 of 512 records where the RN indicated there was (14% false negative rates), and reflected a DNR order in 191 of 1,161 records where the RN indicated there was not (16% false positive rate). The accuracy of DNR was more problematic for patients who died, suggesting that hospital-reported DNR is problematic for capturing patient preferences for resuscitation that can be used for risk-adjusted outcomes assessments.

Abstract = {Background: With the publication of DSM III, the nosology of children and adolescents’ disorders has evolved differently in Francophone and Anglo-Saxon countries. We want to 1/familiarize readers with the nosographic concepts of mood disorders and bipolar disorders in the Francophone world of Adolescent Psychiatry; 2/ highlight the major current issues of concern to both Francophone and Anglo-Saxon adolescents’ psychiatrists. Method: A review of the literature in PubMed, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES, but also of Francophone journals or textbooks not included in these databases nor distributed outside Francophone countries. Results: Although Francophone adolescents’ psychiatrists still rely on the DSM II, particularly in reference to the transitory dimension of problems during adolescence, the DSM III led to a tightening of criteria for bipolar disorder in the Anglo-Saxon countries. These disorders have become rare in the 2000s while still common in Francophone countries. Nowadays the evolution of current criteria in Anglo-Saxon countries tends to bring the diagnostic criteria closer to the Francophone’s one even though important differences still persist. Conclusion: Despite differences between these two approaches in Psychiatry, there is agreement regarding the poor prognosis of type I bipolar disorder, particularly when psychotic traits are observed. Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore a challenge for both, but their limitations are inherent to their respective approaches. In Anglo-Saxon countries, if the criteria are met for bipolar disorder, treatment is decided at the risk of over-diagnosis and stigmatization of false positives. In Francophone countries, even if the criteria for bipolar disorder are met, it is still necessary that the psychopathological analysis of the disorder in the developmental framework of adolescence confirms that the disorder is stable, at the risk of later treatment and of increase of insufficiently treated false negatives. A reconciliation of these fields may limit the above side effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Depression screening in cardiac patients has been recommended by the American Heart Association, but the best approach remains unclear. Objectives To evaluate nurse-administered versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression screening in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome. Methods: Staff nurses in an urban cardiac care unit administered versions 2, 9, and 10 of the questionnaire to 100 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The Depression Interview and Structured Hamilton was administered by advanced practice nurses blinded to the results of the Patient Health Questionnaire. With the results of the Depression Interview and Structured Hamilton as a criterion, receiver operating characteristic analyses were done for each version of the Patient Health Questionnaire. The Delong method was used for pairwise comparisons. Cutoff scores balancing false-negatives and false-positives were determined by using the Youden Index. Results: Each version of the questionnaire had excellent area-under-the-curve statistics: 91.2%, 92.6%, and 93.4% for versions 2, 9, and 10, respectively. Differences among the 3 versions were not significant. Each version yielded higher symptom scores in depressed patients than in nondepressed patients: version 2 scores, 3.4 vs 0.6, P = .001; version 9 scores, 13 vs 3.4, P < .001; and version 10 scores, 14.5 vs 3.6, P < .001. Conclusions: For depression screening in hospitalized patients with acute coronary syndrome, the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 is as accurate as longer versions when administered by nurses. Further study is needed to determine if screening with this tool changes clinical decision making or improves outcomes in these patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the reliability and therapeutic impact of standardized cerebral CT evaluation and quantification of early ischemic changes (EIC) with the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) by stroke neurologists in the Stroke Eastern Saxony Network (SOS-NET), which provides telemedical consultations for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: Two neuroradiologists re-evaluated all CT scans of consecutive SOS-NET patients in 2009 blinded to clinical information providing reference standard. We defined discrepant CT findings as all false-positive or false-negative EIC and brain pathology findings and ASPECTS deviations > 1 point. We subsequently discussed the clinical impact of discrepant CT findings unblinded to clinical information. Weighted kappa (kw) statistic was used to determine the interobserver agreement for ASPECTS. Results: Of 582 patients, complete imaging data were available for 536 patients (351 cerebral ischemic events, 105 primary intracranial hemorrhages, and 80 stroke mimics). The neuroradiologists detected discrepant CT findings in 43 patients (8.0%) that were rated as clinically relevant in 9 patients (1.7%). Stroke neurologists recommended IV thrombolysis in 8 patients despite extensive EIC (ASPECTS ≤ 5). One of these patients had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. In 1 nonthrombolyzed patient, the stroke neurologist missed subdural hematoma. The interobserver agreement on ASPECTS between stroke neurologists and expert readers was substantial (kw = 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.71). Conclusions: Clinically relevant misinterpretation of the CT scans was rare in our acute telestroke service. ASPECTS is a reliable tool to assess the extent of EIC by stroke neurologists in telemedicine in real time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed major changes in the way that mental health professionals assess, describe, and think about persons’ risk for future violence. Psychiatrists and psychologists have gone from believing that they could not predict violence to feeling certain they can assess violence risk with well-above-chance accuracy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis has played a central role in changing this view. This article reviews the key concepts underlying ROC methods, the meaning of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the relationship between AUC and effect size d, and what these two indices tell us about evaluations of violence risk. The area under the ROC curve and d provide succinct but incomplete descriptions of discrimination capacity. These indices do not provide details about sensitivity–specificity trade-offs; they do not tell us how to balance false-positive and false-negative errors; and they do not determine whether a diagnostic system is accurate enough to make practically useful distinctions between violent and non-violent subject groups. Justifying choices or clinical practices requires a contextual investigation of outcomes, a process that takes us beyond simply knowing global indices of accuracy.

Abstract = {Breast cancer is a leading cancer affecting women worldwide. Mammography is a scanning procedure involving X‐rays of the breast. It causes discomfort and may cause high incidence of false negatives. Breast thermography is a new screening method of breast that helps in the early detection of cancer. It is a non‐invasive imaging procedure that captures the infrared heat radiating off from the breast surface using an infrared camera. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the use of higher order spectral features extracted from thermograms in classifying normal and abnormal thermograms. For this purpose, we extracted five higher order spectral features and used them in a feed‐forward artificial neural network (ANN) classifier and a support vector machine (SVM). Fifty thermograms (25 each of normal and abnormal) were used for analysis. SVM presented a good sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 84%, and the ANN classifier demonstrated higher values of sensitivity (92%) and specificity (88%). The proposed system, therefore, shows great promise in automatic classification of normal and abnormal breast thermograms without the need for subjective interpretation.

Abstract = {Background: The aim was to determine the risk of Mood Disorders (MD), particularly Bipolar Disorders (BD), in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using standardized psychiatric diagnostic tools. Methods: Case–control study. Cases: 201 consecutive-patients with MS. Controls: 804 sex- and age-matched subjects without MS, randomly selected from a database concurrently used for an epidemiological study on the MD prevalence in the community. Psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-IV were determined by physicians using structured interview tools (ANTAS-SCID). Results: Compared to controls, MS patients had a higher lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorders (MDD; P < 0.0001), BD I (P = 0.05), BD II (P < 0.0001) and Cyclothymia (P = 0.0001). As people with MS had a higher risk of depressive and bipolar spectrum disorders, ratio MDD/bipolar spectrum disorders was lower among cases (P < 0.005) indicating a higher association with Bipolar Spectrum Disorders and MS. Limitations: MS diagnosis was differently collected in cases and controls. Even if this might have produced false negatives in controls, it would have reinforced the null hypothesis of no increased risk for MD in MS; therefore, it does not invalidate the results of the study. Conclusions: This study was the first to show an association between BD and MS using standardized diagnostic tools and a case–control design. The results suggest a risk of under-diagnosis of BD (particularly type II) in MS and caution in prescribing ADs to people with depressive episodes in MS without prior excluding BD. The association between auto-immune degenerative diseases (like MS) and BD may be an interesting field for the study of the pathogenic hypothesis.

Abstract = {TCF4 is a transcription factor involved in the development of central nervous system strongly associated with schizophrenia, as revealed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes the Pitt–Hopkins syndrome, a syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, wide mouth, and hyperventilation. The haploinsufficiency is due to mutations causing premature stop codons, missense mutations, translocations or deletions. We focused on UC435 (ultraconserved elements), testing for the existence of highly penetrant alleles associated with schizophrenia at this UCE. The sample consists of 528 schizophrenic cases and 270 controls from Galicia (NW Spain). Cases are subjects attending public hospitals at the Galician health service meeting the DSMIV criteria for schizophrenia. HMRA of our samples did not detect any variant. A few samples presenting anomalous curves were processed again, leading to normal curves. Sequencing of the nine samples with more different melting curves con firmed the absence of nucleotide differences.The HRMA technique is highly effective in the detection of rare variants present in heterozygosity ( Vossen et al., 2009). Assuming that there were not false negatives in our results, we have a probability higher than 80% to detect a variant at population frequency higher than 0.15% in a sample of 528 cases. Therefore, we can discard allelic variants at UC435 with a combination of frequencies and effects similar to many recurrent copy number variants (CNVs) that confer moderate risk to schizophrenia. For instance, duplication at 16p11.2, and deletions at 1q21.1, 15q13.3, or 22q11.2, present a frequency in schizophrenic patients higher than 0.15% but clearly lower than 0.1% in controls ( Malhotra and Sebat, 2012 ). Further analyses with larger sample sizes will be necessary to test for variants causing a weaker effect on schizophrenia risk or variants at lower frequency causing stronger effect.

Abstract = {Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) cover a group of heterogeneous disorders in which the neuromuscular transmission is affected. We diagnosed CMS in nine unrelated patients in the Netherlands. Six mutations were discovered in the acetylcholine receptor epsilon subunit gene, two in the receptor-associated protein of the synapse gene and one mutation in dolichyl-phosphate (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1. We describe the diagnostic work up in these children and common diagnostic pitfalls that caused delay in diagnosis and treatment, such as the lack of specificity of clinical features, technical drawbacks of invasive testing in young children, non-specific changes in muscle histology and false negative results of electromyography. Early initiation of treatment and alternative treatment regimens can considerably improve the quality of life of patients with CMS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: It has proved possible to detect persons who are in an at risk mental state (ARMS) and who run the risk of developing a psychosis. We need to find out whether the detection can be successfully carried out when these patients are being cared for by the secondary mental health care services. Aim: To summarise three studies forming part of a Ph.D. thesis about persons with a high risk of developing psychosis and to explore whether a two-stage screening programme can detect ARMS-patients among a general help-seeking population. Method: The case register of Parnassia (in The Hague) was used to pick out all persons who had developed a first-episode psychosis between 2005 and 2009 and who had sought help for non-psychotic psychological problems during this phase preceding a first-episode psychosis. Data from the Dutch EDIE-NL study were used to find out whether a two-stage screening method was able to detect arms-patients (aged 18-30) more accurately than the traditional screening method. The two-stage screening consisted of a Prodromal Questionnaire relating to all help-seeking subjects in the general population, followed by a gold-standard interview with patients who achieved a score higher than the cut-off level. Results: 56.2% of the first-episode psychotic patients received help for non-psychotic psychiatric problems in the secondary mental health care services. Screening detected more ARMS-patients than did the referral method and the ‘referred’ patients developed three times as many psychotic symptoms over a period of 18 months. Conclusion: The secondary mental health care services care for 4% of the ARMS-patients and are in a position to detect ARMS-patients provided they use two-stage screening. Screening leads to fewer false-negative results than does the ‘referral’ method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare structured clinical assessment versus research measurement of suicidal risk among inpatients with major depression. Fifty depressed inpatients underwent a structured clinical and an independent research assessment of suicidal risk. Agreement between both assessments and its impact upon time to first readmission was tested. A false negative rate of 25% in the clinical screening of past suicide attempts was associated with older age, concealment, and reported lower frequency of suicidal thoughts. Mean times to first readmission (2.5 years follow-up) were 74 weeks (discordant responders) and 118 weeks (concordant responders). A failure to detect 25% of patients with past suicide attempt history in the clinical assessment was associated with older age and concealment of suicidal thoughts.

Abstract = {To determine whether the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) in conjunction with the routine 18-month health check-up identifies Japanese toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two-stage screening using the M-CHAT was conducted with 1,851 children attending the check-up. Final ASD diagnosis was confirmed at age ≥ 3 years. Screening identified 20/51 children with ASD: 12/20 true positives were developmentally delayed, whereas 16/22 false negatives were high-functioning. Sensitivity was 0.476, specificity 0.986, positive predictive value 0.455, and likelihood ratio 33.4 for children with ASD. With a few modifications, M-CHAT screening successfully detected toddlers with ASD with and without developmental delay and is a promising screening tool to complement existing community surveillance.

Abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 23(1) of European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (see record [rid]2014-02871-004[/rid]). In the original article, the family name of fourth author was erroneously reported as ‘‘Casale’’. The correct family name should be ‘‘Del Casale’’. The correction is present in the erratum.] The delusional misidentification syndromes, occurring within the context of different nosological settings, such as schizophrenia, are psychopathological phenomena related to the experience of depersonalisation/derealisation. Extensive research indicates that individuals meeting specific "prodromal" criteria, such as attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief intermittent psychotic symptoms, or functional decline and family history of schizophrenia have increased risk for impending psychosis. Despite depersonalisation and/or derealisation often precede psychotic onset, they are not included among the prodromal criteria of the Australian–American approach. A 17-year-old boy with acute agitation, violent behaviour and aggression, and dissociative amnesia had a mild verbal memory impairment and temporo-limbic hypometabolism on the positron-emission tomography. The patient was assessed with both the ultra-high risk (UHR) and the basic symptom approaches and was not found to be prodromal with imminent risk of transition to psychosis. He was hospitalised briefly and 2 weeks after discharge he developed delusional misidentification. This case shows that even the integration of both UHR and basic symptoms criteria may give false negatives in the prediction of psychosis, especially in those cases in which a long prodromal phase is absent.

Abstract = {There is little research from low- and middle-income countries examining the psychometric properties of a screening tool for social anxiety disorder. The sensitivity and specificity of the Social Anxiety Screening Questionnaire against the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview as a gold standard in social phobia diagnosis were investigated using analyses of receiver operating characteristics. The "best subsets" selection procedure was conducted to determine the best three to five questions. Three questions on the screening questionnaire that best discriminate between a positive and negative diagnosis of social anxiety disorder on the MINI module were identified. Answering yes to all three of these questions gives a false-positive rate of 0.44 and a false negative rate of 0.11. For this combination, the sensitivity was 0.84, and specificity was 0.67. Additional work is needed to develop a more accurate scale that could help increase the percentage of people who receive appropriate treatment of this debilitating disorder.

Abstract = {Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used over the past decade to study structural differences in the brains of children with autism compared with typically developing children. These studies generally find reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) in children with autism; however, the regional pattern of findings varies greatly. Methods: We used DTI to investigate the brains of sedated children with autism (n = 39) and naturally asleep typically developing children (n = 39) between 2 and 8 years of age. Tract based spatial statistics and whole brain voxel-wise analysis were performed to investigate the regional distribution of differences between groups. Results: In children with autism, we found significantly reduced FA in widespread regions and increased MD only in posterior brain regions. Significant age × group interaction was found, indicating a difference in developmental trends of FA and MD between children with autism and typically developing children. The magnitude of the measured differences between groups was small, on the order of approximately 1%–2%. Subjects and control subjects showed distinct regional differences in imaging artifacts that can affect DTI measures. Conclusions: We found statistically significant differences in DTI metrics between children with autism and typically developing children, including different developmental trends of these metrics. However, this study indicates that between-group differences in DTI studies of autism should be interpreted with caution, because their small magnitude make these measurements particularly vulnerable to the effects of artifacts and confounds, which might lead to false positive and/or false negative biological inferences.

Abstract = {The Resilience Scale was developed to identify "the degree of individual resilience, considered a positive personality characteristic that enhances individual adaptation." The aim of this report is to present reliability estimates for this scale, including absolute reliability measures that have not previously been reported. The Resilience Scale was originated in a qualitative study of old women who had recovered from major losses; however, the developers have stated that the scale can be used for both sexes and all ages. A Swedish-speaking purposive sample of 142 people was included in a study to evaluate the properties of the Swedish version of the Resilience Scale. The study has been presented previously in greater detail. The age of the participants ranged from 19 to 85 years, and 54% were women. The sample included 40 senior citizens over the age of 65 years, 50 people from the working population, and 52 students. In conclusion, this analysis shows that a change of 16 points or more on the Resilience Scale is needed to conclude, with a 95% level of significance, that a change has occurred between two measurements in the same person. If an 80% level of significance is judged to be acceptable, a change of 10 points is needed. When deciding which level of significance to use, the clinical implications of false-negative and false-positive results must be considered, and, also, some estimation must be made of the magnitude of change that usually represents a clinically important change. Finally, the authors would like to encourage the publication of absolute reliability calculations for different assessment scales because this measure is of great importance for the clinical use of such scales. Many of the assessment scales that are currently in clinical use have not yet been properly evaluated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Seven male competitive cyclists (age; M = 34.14 years, SD = 7.40) completed two ergometer time-trials, one each with false negative and false positive feedback (time ± 5 %). MANOVA indicated main effects for condition [F(17, 104) = 9.42, p < 0.001], and mile [F(153, 849) = 1.58, p < 0.001], but no interaction [F(153, 849) = 0.470, p = 1.00]. No between-condition differences in power (F = 0.129, p = 0.720) or time to completion (F = 1.011, p = 0.338) were observed. Positive feedback was associated with higher glucose (F = 25.988, p < 0.01), happiness (F = 6.097, p = 0.015) and calmness (F = 4.088, p = 0.045).

Abstract = {According to the aberrant-salience hypothesis, attribution of motivational salience is severely disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. To provide a translational approach for investigating underlying mechanisms, neural correlates of salience attribution were examined in normal mice and in a MK-801 model of schizophrenia. Electrophysiological responses to standard and deviant tones were assessed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using an auditory oddball paradigm Motivational salience was induced by aversive conditioning to the deviant tone. Analysis of the auditor/evoked potential (AEP) showed selective modulation of the late frontal negativity (LFN) by motivational salience, which persisted throughout a 4-week delay. MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, abolished this differential response to motivational salience in conditioned mice In contrast, a pronounced LFN response was observed towards the deviant, le, perceptually salient tone, in nonconditioned mice. The finding of a selective modulation of a late frontal slow wave suggests increased top-down processing and emotional evaluation of motivationally salient stimuli. In particular, the LFN is discussed as the mouse analog to the human stimulus preceding negativity, which reflects preparatory processes in anticipation of reward or punishment MK-801 led to a disruption of the normal response in conditioned and nonconditioned mice, including an aberrantly increased LFN in nonconditioned mice. This pattern of 'false-negative' and 'false-positive' responses suggests a degradation of salience attribution, which points to mPFC responses to be relevant for translational research on cognitive alterations in schizophrenia.

Abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are brain areas of increased signal onT2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inverse recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In this study we present a new semi-automated method to measure WMH load that is based on the segmentation of the intensity histogram of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Thirty patients with mild cognitive impairment with variable WMH load were enrolled. The semi-automated WMH segmentation included removal of non-brain tissue, spatial normalization, removal of cerebellum and brain stem, spatial filtering, thresholding to segment probable WMH, manual editing for correction of false positives and negatives, generation of WMH map, and volumetric estimation of the WMH load. Accuracy was quantitatively evaluated by comparing semi-automated and manual WMH segmentations performed by two independent raters. Differences between the two procedures were assessed using Student’s t-tests and similarity was evaluated using linear regression model and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The volumes of the manual and semi-automated segmentations did not statistically differ (t -value = −1.79, DF = 29, p = 0.839 for rater 1; t -value = 1.113, DF = 29, p = 0.2749 for rater 2), were highly correlated [R² = 0.921, F(1,29) = 155.54, p < 0.0001 for rater 1; R² = 0.935, F(1,29) = 402.709, p < 0.0001 for rater 2] and showed a very strong spatial similarity (mean DSC = 0.78, for rater 1 and 0.77 for rater 2). In conclusion, our semi-automated method to measure the load of WMH is highly reliable and could represent a good tool that could be easily implemented in routinely neuroimaging analyses to map clinical consequences of WMH.

Abstract = {Background: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms and severity. In this study we analysed the predictive value of clinical signs and symptoms and the contribution of D-dimer measurements for diagnosis. Methods: We evaluated consecutive patients admitted with suspected CVT receiving non-invasive imaging. Symptoms and symptom combination as well as D-dimer levels were evaluated regarding their diagnostic value. Results: 239 patients were included in this study, 170 (71%) were females. In 39 patients (16%) a CVT was found. For identifying a CVT patients underwent either a venous CT-angiography or MR-angiography or both. No combination of symptoms either alone or together with the D-dimer measurements had a sensitivity and positive predictive value as well as negative predictive value and specificity high enough to serve as red flag. D-dimer testing produced rates of 9% false positive and of 24% false negative results. For D-dimer values a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC = 0.921; CI: 0.864 - 0.977) were calculated. An increase of sensitivity above 0.9 results in a relevant decrease in specificity; a sensitivity of 0.9 matches a specificity value of 0.9. This corresponds to a D-dimer cut-off level of 0.16 μg/ml. Conclusion: Imaging as performed by venous CT-angiography or MR-angiography has a 1 to 2 in 10 chance to detect CVT when typical symptoms are present. D-dimer measurements are of limited clinical value because of false positive and negative results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This editorial argues for the adoption of a new way of using 2 standard deviations (SD) instead of a constant cutoff score when screening for cognitive impairment or dementia. To distinguish the abnormal (i.e. > 2 SD) from the normal, a large-scale community-based epidemiological study should be conducted to establish the norm among the total population by finding the mean and SD resulting from the battery of tests. Thereafter, the abnormal can be defined by an algorithm as follows: If test score < score at 2 SD. then 'normal', or If test score > score at 2 SD, then 'abnormal'. The individual-specific score of 2 SD should be determined by age and education of a testee. Therefore, there is no constant cutoff score but it varies by age and education of the individual. This way using 2 SD instead of a single cutoff score is a better method that can greatly reduce false-positives and false-negatives when screening for cognitive impairment or dementia (Fig). As mentioned earlier, this notion has been already adopted to diagnose mental retardation and MCI. To adopt the new way of using 2 SD instead of a constant cutoff score, it is recommended to use computer assisted tests or batteries using the norm of total population. Thus, the computer can calculate the 2 SD point of an individual of certain age and certain number of years of education to define what to call an abnormal score. Recent advances in information technology can help us to adopt these new methods. The platform to set such a test or battery of tests must be widely popular, and devices like tablet computers and laptops can be useful and convenient in this respect. In the near future, such computer-assisted testing will replace paper and pencil tests to eliminate effects of age and education on the test score, and in so doing greatly increase diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract = {Human nature, being what it is, leads to the pernicious phenomenon in the scientific literature of publication bias. We are much more excited and motivated to report the successes than the failures. This is a particularly troublesome tendency when it comes to clinical trials. Studies that fail to reject the null hypothesis are more likely to languish on in draft form and never get published. This editorial is a call for such papers from human clinical trials. Neurology believes it is important to advance research related to neurologic disease and that well-designed studies on important clinical topics should be published, whether or not the results are “positive.” Neurology wants negative studies that are themselves methodologically rigorous and, equally importantly, motivated by strong and convincing basic science. Some of the featured that go into a methodologically rigorous clinical trial are, the sample size must be sufficient to have the statistical power to avoid a false-negative result, the study participants must be properly defined and screened, the outcome measure must be reliable and valid and the conduct of the study itself must not leave doubt about the validity of the results: excessive attrition or unbelievably low attrition raise doubts about how a study was designed, monitored, and reported.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by J Phelps & S N Ghaemi (see record [rid]2012-30246-002[/rid]). Phelps & Ghaemi described psychiatric diagnostic accuracy assessments using overlapping statistical constructs, primarily True Positive Rate ⁄ Positive Predictive Value ⁄ Sensitivity and True Negative Rate ⁄ Negative Predictive Value ⁄ Specificity. Phelps & Ghaemi addressed the diagnostic accuracy problem for bipolar disorder reported which was an overly high False Positive Rate whereas the False Negative Rate was not considered problematic. Phelps & Ghaemi suggested including non-symptom clinical features like family history and age at illness onset to increase the prior prevalence of bipolar disorder, which in turn can enhance diagnostic accuracy by decreasing the False Positive Rate, that is, by increasing the True Positive Rate ⁄ Positive Predictive Value, which at 43% has considerable room for increase. Phelps & Ghaemi described this as just common sense. Indeed, clinicians who ignore potentially important clinical features not necessarily spelt out in diagnostic criteria can encounter substantial challenges in telling their posteriors from their priors.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Dena S. Davis (see record [rid]2014-29988-009[/rid]). Dena Davis paper explained the situation of the patient having the state of mind "‘I’d rather be dead than have Alzheimer’s." Dena Davis explained why this is a reasonable position. People taking this position will welcome the discovery of biomarkers permitting very early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis, Davis suggested, for this will enable more of them to end their lives while they remain motivated and able to do so. The real problem for people intent on self-destruction is that biomarkers are unlikely to deliver a clear suicide signal. First, as Davis noted, work on biomarkers remains in the research stage. No one yet knows whether biomarker tests will prove accurate enough to warrant clinical use. Second, even clinically accepted biomarker tests will generate imperfect information about future disease. Biomarkers may produce more accurate estimates of a person's risk of developing AD, but like all predictive tests, they will also yield false positive and negative results. The presence of a biomarker will not indicate with certainty whether or when an individual is destined to develop memory loss and other AD symptoms. Davis predicts that people will be driven to pre-emptive suicide because there is no guarantee that their precedent autonomy will be respected at the bedside. If people could refuse all lifesustaining treatment in advance, she contends, they would be more comfortable living with the risks of AD.

Abstract = {The interpretation of forensic fingerprint evidence relies on the expertise of latent print examiners. The National Research Council of the National Academies and the legal and forensic sciences communities have called for research to measure the accuracy and reliability of latent print examiners’ decisions, a challenging and complex problem in need of systematic analysis. Our research is focused on the development of empirical approaches to studying this problem. Here, we report on the first large-scale study of the accuracy and reliability of latent print examiners’ decisions, in which 169 latent print examiners each compared approximately 100 pairs of latent and exemplar fingerprints from a pool of 744 pairs. The fingerprints were selected to include a range of attributes and quality encountered in forensic casework, and to be comparable to searches of an automated fingerprint identification system containing more than 58 million subjects. This study evaluated examiners on key decision points in the fingerprint examination process; procedures used operationally include additional safeguards designed to minimize errors. Five examiners made false positive errors for an overall false positive rate of 0.1%. Eighty-five percent of examiners made at least one false negative error for an overall false negative rate of 7.5%. Independent examination of the same comparisons by different participants (analogous to blind verification) was found to detect all false positive errors and the majority of false negative errors in this study. Examiners frequently differed on whether fingerprints were suitable for reaching a conclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present research was to examine Deese-Roediger-McDermott false memory for trauma-related and nontrauma-related lists in adolescents and adults with and without documented histories of child sexual abuse (CSA). Individual differences in psychopathology and adult attachment were also explored. Participants were administered free recall and recognition tests after hearing CSA, negative, neutral, and positive Deese-Roediger-McDermott lists. In free recall, CSA and negative lists produced the most false memory. In sharp contrast, for recognition, CSA lists enjoyed the highest d' scores. CS A-group adolescents who evinced greater posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms had higher rates of false memory compared to (a) non-CSA group adolescents with higher PTSD symptom scores (free recall), and (b) CSA-group adolescents with lower PTSD symptom scores (recognition). Regression analyses revealed that individuals with higher PTSD scores and greater fearful-avoidant attachment tendencies showed less proficient memory monitoring for CSA lists. Implications for trauma and memory development and for translational research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Previous studies carried out within the rule-discovery paradigm demonstrated that people use different strategies depending on the affective value of the rule exemplars (i.e., whether they are sources of personal gains or losses). When learning positive categories, people tend to attach more weight to false positives than false negatives, resulting in overly narrow final categories (prevalence of sufficient over necessary categorization criteria), whereas when learning negative categories, the relative weights attached to the categorization errors are reversed, resulting in larger final categories and a prevalence of necessary over sufficient categorization criteria. This asymmetry is underlain by the affective negativity effect, responsible for risk aversion in decision making. In the present study, we tested the role of anxiety in categorization behaviour, operationalized within Gray’s theory of the behaviour inhibition system (BIS), and predicted intensification of the usual asymmetry in high BIS participants. Using the rule-discovery paradigm we manipulated the affective meaning of categories (gains vs. losses) and type of feedback for categorization decisions (full vs. incomplete feedback). Results confirmed positive–negative asymmetry in categorization. However, contrary to expectations, the high BIS persons placed in the incomplete feedback gain conditions were not more but less risk averse than were low BIS persons.

Abstract = {Background: Recent advances in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have made rapid acquisition, visualization, and interpretation of images a key factor for positive patient outcomes. We have developed a new teleradiology system based on a client-server architecture that enables rapid access to interactive advanced 2-D and 3-D visualization on a current generation smartphone device (Apple iPhone or iPod Touch, or an Android phone) without requiring patient image data to be stored on the device. Instead, a server loads and renders the patient images, then transmits a rendered frame to the remote device. Objective: Our objective was to determine if a new smartphone client-server teleradiology system is capable of providing accuracies and interpretation times sufficient for diagnosis of acute stroke. Methods: This was a retrospective study. We obtained 120 recent consecutive noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) brain scans and 70 computed tomography angiogram (CTA) head scans from the Calgary Stroke Program database. Scans were read by two neuroradiologists, one on a medical diagnostic workstation and an iPod or iPhone (hereafter referred to as an iOS device) and the other only on an iOS device. NCCT brain scans were evaluated for early signs of infarction, which includes early parenchymal ischemic changes and dense vessel sign, and to exclude acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage and stroke mimics. CTA brain scans were evaluated for any intracranial vessel occlusion. The interpretations made on an iOS device were compared with those made at a workstation. The total interpretation times were recorded for both platforms. Interrater agreement was assessed. True positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives were obtained, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting the abnormalities on the iOS device were computed. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting intraparenchymal hemorrhage were 100% using the iOS device with a perfect interrater agreement (kappa = 1). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting acute parenchymal ischemic change were 94.1%, 100%, and 98.09% respectively for reader 1 and 97.05%, 100%, and 99.04% for reader 2 with nearly perfect interrater agreement (kappa = .8). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting dense vessel sign were 100%, 95.4%, and 96.19% respectively for reader 1 and 72.2%, 100%, and 95.23% for reader 2 using the iOS device with a good interrater agreement (kappa = .69). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting vessel occlusion on CT angiography scans were 94.4%, 100%, and 98.46% respectively for both readers using the iOS device, with perfect interrater agreement (kappa = 1). No significant difference (P < .05) was noted in the interpretation time between the workstation and iOS device. Conclusion: The smartphone client-server teleradiology system appears promising and may have the potential to allow urgent management decisions in acute stroke. However, this study was retrospective, involved relatively few patient studies, and only two readers. Generalizing conclusions about its clinical utility, especially in other diagnostic use cases, should not be made until additional studies are performed.

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the clinical value of early partial symptomatic improvement in predicting the probability of response during the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. Methods: Blinded data from 10 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in bipolar I or II depression were used to determine if early improvement (≥20% reduction in depression symptom severity after 14 days of treatment) predicted later short-term response or remission. Sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated using an intent to treat analysis of individual and pooled study data. Results: 1913 patients were randomized to active compounds (aripiprazole, lamotrigine, olanzapine/olanzapine–fluoxetine, and quetiapine), and 1456 to placebo. In the pooled positive studies, early improvement predicted response and remission with high sensitivity (86% and 88%, respectively), but rates of false positives were high (53% and 59%, respectively). Pooled negative predictive values for response/remission (i.e. confidence in knowing the drug will not result in response or remission) were 74% and 82%, respectively, with low rates of false negatives (14% and 12%, respectively). Conclusion: Early improvement in an individual patient does not appear to be a reliable predictor of eventual response or remission due to an unacceptably high false positive rate. However, the absence of early improvement appears to be a highly reliable predictor of eventual non-response, suggesting that clinicians can have confidence in knowing when a drug is not going to work during short-term treatment. Patients who fail to demonstrate early improvement within the first two weeks of treatment may benefit from a change in therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: Classical inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) affect about 1 in 4000 in Hong Kong. Despite the widespread implementation of expanded newborn screening in most countries, Hong Kong only screen for three conditions and the awareness of public has not been evaluated. This is the first study to examine the parental knowledge and attitudes towards expanded newborn screening in Hong Kong. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Princess Margaret Hospital. Parents with babies born from 1st July to 31st October 2010 were randomly recruited. Fifteen questions relating to the knowledge of newborn screening and biochemical genetic disorders, preferences about the features of newborn screening, the economic values, and attitudes toward false positive results were asked. Results: In total, 172 subjects were interviewed by phone (overall response rate 97.2%). There were 87.8% parents who had never heard of expanded newborn screening; 99.4% demanded more parental education; 83.5% thought the programme should be implemented immediately; 97.7% supported population screening, even though the diseases are incurable; 93.9% accepted the possibility of false positive and false negative results; 70.4% preferred a voluntary basis; 83.2% believed that the programme should be fully government funded as basic primary care; 98.8% agreed that Hong Kong should follow mainland China's policy on expanded newborn screening; 98.2% required pre-test counseling; and 96.4% required an explicit parental consent before blood sampling. Conclusions: The response from parents overwhelmingly favoured having expanded newborn screening in Hong Kong. Parental tolerance was high. Parents valued the parental autonomy with informed consent and pre-test counseling the most. The success of any screening programme requires the public participation and this study is the first to prove the parental call for an expanded newborn screening in Hong Kong.

Abstract = {Several influential publications have sensitized the community of behavioral scientists to the dangers of inflated effects and false-positive errors leading to the unwarranted publication of nonreplicable findings. This issue has been related to prominent cases of data fabrication and survey results pointing to bad practices in empirical science. Although we concur with the motives behind these critical arguments, we note that an isolated debate of false positives may itself be misleading and counter-productive. Instead, we argue that, given the current state of affairs in behavioral science, false negatives often constitute a more serious problem. Referring to Wason’s (1960) seminal work on inductive reasoning, we show that the failure to assertively generate and test alternative hypotheses can lead to dramatic theoretical mistakes, which cannot be corrected by any kind of rigor applied to statistical tests of the focal hypotheses. We conclude that a scientific culture rewarding strong inference (Platt, 1964) is more likely to see progress than a culture preoccupied with tightening its standards for the mere publication of original findings.

Abstract = {This masked controlled study evaluated a group of dogs to determine if the results of two behavior assessments detected aggression in dogs that had a history of aggression according to a validated questionnaire for measuring behavior and temperament traits in dogs. Groups of dogs with or without a history of aggression were identified from owner-completed questionnaires for 67 dogs. Any dogs that had a maximum score of no greater than 1 for any question comprising aggression factors were placed in the low/no aggression group and any dogs that had a maximum score of 2 or higher on any question comprising the aggression factors were placed in the moderate to severe aggression group. This second group was further divided to separate moderate aggression from severe aggression. Two behavior assessments, Meet Your Match (MYM)™ Safety Assessment for Evaluating Rehoming™ (SAFER™) (SAFER) and a modified version of Assess-A-Pet (mAAP), were administered to each dog in random order by assistants masked to the dogs’ behavioral histories. The scores for each assessment were divided into binary categorizations (no aggression or aggression). For SAFER, the aggression category was further divided, separating dogs that showed fear, arousal or inhibited aggression from those that showed moderate aggression, and from those that showed severe aggression. The previously established categories for the mAAP of ‘no issue’, ‘unsocial’, ‘borderline’ and ‘fail’ were also used. Subtest scores for each assessment were also summed. With binary categorization, SAFER showed both lower sensitivity and specificity at 0.60 (95% confidence limits (CL)=0.44, 0.74) and 0.50 (95% CL=0.28, 0.72) respectively, than mAAP at 0.73 (95% CL=0.58, 0.85) and 0.59 (95% CL=0.36, 0.79) respectively. The odds ratio showed that an aggressive dog was 4.1-fold more likely to be classified in an aggression group by the mAAP test and 1.5 times more likely by SAFER. When the assessments were split into multiple categories, SAFER results were no longer significant, but mAAP maintained a statistically significant but weak correlation of 0.34 (P =0.005) with historical aggression categories. SAFER testing was unable to identify dogs with moderate aggression that could potentially be addressed with behavior modification. By independently selecting acceptable levels of false positive or false negative results for the assessment, summed score results could be used in shelters as an aid to selecting dogs for adoption. Behavioral assessment results should be used in conjunction with other information such as intake history and staff observations to make an informed outcome decision for an individual dog.

Abstract = {The systematic errors that are induced by a combination of human memory limitations and common survey design and implementation have long been studied in the context of egocentric networks. Despite this, little if any work exists in the area of random error analysis on these same networks; this paper offers a perspective on the effects of random errors on egonet analysis, as well as the effects of using egonet measures as independent predictors in linear models. We explore the effects of false-positive and false-negative error in egocentric networks on both standard network measures and on linear models through simulation analysis on a ground truth egocentric network sample based on facebook-friendships. Results show that 5–20% error rates, which are consistent with error rates known to occur in ego network data, can cause serious misestimation of network properties and regression parameters.

We simulate these six measurement errors using an online social network and a publication citation network, reporting their effects on four node-level measures—degree centrality, clustering coefficient, network constraint, and eigenvector centrality. Our results suggest that in networks with more positively-skewed degree distributions and higher average clustering, these measures tend to be less resistant to most forms of measurement error. In addition, we argue that the sensitivity of a given measure to an error scenario depends on the idiosyncracies of the measure’s calculation, thus revising the general claim from past research that the more ‘global’ a measure, the less resistant it is to measurement error. Finally, we anchor our discussion to commonly-used networks in past research that suffer from these different forms of measurement error and make recommendations for correction strategies.

Abstract = {In monitoring a patient with chronic pain who was taking high-dose morphine and oxycodone with weekly urine enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) toxicology testing, the authors noted consistent positives for buprenorphine. The patient was not taking buprenorphine, and gas chromatography/ mass spectroscopy (GCMS) testing on multiple samples revealed no buprenorphine, indicating a case of false-positive buprenorphine EIAs in a high-dose opiate case. The authors discontinued oxycodone for a period of time and then discontinued morphine. Urine monitoring with EIAs and GCMS revealed false-positive buprenorphine EIAs, which remained only when the patient was taking morphine. When taking only oxycodone and no morphine, urine samples became buprenorphine negative. When morphine was reintroduced, false-positive buprenorphine results resumed. Medical practitioners should be aware that high-dose morphine (with morphine urine levels turning positive within the 15,000 to 28,000 mg/mL range) may produce false-positive buprenorphine EIAs with standard urine EIA toxicology testing.

Simons (see record [rid]2012-24666-001[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2012-12905-004[/rid]). In this reply, we respond to methodological points raised by Boot and Simons (2012) to a paper on video game experience and optimization of executive control processes (Strobach, Frensch, & Schubert, 2012). In sum, we assume that differences in strategies to recruit expert game players and novices cannot explain performance differences in cognitive tasks between both groups of participants as a sole account. Further, in contrast to Tetris training, exclusive effects after training with an action game on complex task situations including two different tasks certainly do not result from differences in the levels of motivation between both training types during the transfer tests. Finally, a lack of retest effects from pre- to post-test during transfer may result from relatively short durations of these tests. We discuss these points in conjunction with a perspective for balancing false positive and false negative errors in training research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

The authors and the Work Group agreed completely that the diagnostic threshold "has slipped lower, perhaps in part as a result of the significant funds devoted to marketing new compounds for the treatment of bipolar disorder". It is impossible not to draw this conclusion given the astounding sales of antipsychotic drugs that resulted from billion-dollar marketing budgets devoted to disease-mongering bipolar disorder. The disagreement is not in the Work Group's assessment of this problem, but in their lack of appropriate response to it. It is disappointing that the Work Group seriously entertained suggestions to further dilute bipolar diagnosis, but it did nothing to substantially tighten the criteria set or to provide black box cautions about its over-use. The authors agree that severely ill patients are too often missed, but this arises from insufficient access to care, not because the criteria are too tight. The Work Group consistently worried too much about false negatives and not nearly enough about false positives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Zahednasab indicates that several studies have investigated JCV-DNA in urine as a potential tool for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk stratification. In one of the largest studies, urinary JCV-DNA could not be detected in 1 of 3 patients who subsequently developed PML, urinary JCV excretion was detected frequently and did not increase during natalizumab treatment. Thus, predictive values of either positive or negative tests appear to be low. Using urinary JCV-DNA analysis, a false negative rate of the 2-step anti-JCVantibody ELISA of approximately 2.7% can be calculated. Due to lack of biomaterial we were not able to determine the rate of false-negative findings of anti-JCV serology in our cohort. Given the current label of natalizumab in Germany, the majority of patients have undergone immunomodulatory pretreatment. Since we aimed to investigate the potential utility of anti-JCV serology in clinical practice, we did not exclude these patients from analysis. We agree that further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the predictive value of anti-JCV antibody testing in PML risk stratification.

Abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired memory performance coupled with functional changes in brain areas involved in declarative memory and emotion regulation. It is not yet clear how symptom severity and comorbidity affect neurocognitive functioning in PTSD. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with an emotional declarative memory task in 28 Complex PTSD patients with comorbid depressive and personality disorders, and 21 healthy nontrauma-exposed controls. In Complex PTSD patients— compared to controls —encoding of later remembered negative words vs baseline was associated with increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response in the left ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal ACC extending to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) together with a trend for increased left hippocampus activation. Patients tended to commit more False Alarms to negative words compared to controls, which was associated with enhanced left ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex (vlPFC/OFC) responses. Severity of child abuse was positively correlated with left ventral ACC activity and severity of depression with (para) hippocampal and ventral ACC activity. Presented results demonstrate functional abnormalities in Complex PTSD in the frontolimbic brain circuit also implicated in fear conditioning models, but generally in the opposite direction, which may be explained by severity of the trauma and severity of comorbid depression in Complex PTSD.

Abstract = {Models of depression suggest that depression, which is characterized by sad mood, should confer a recall advantage for negative stimuli, including stressful life events. The current study examined the effects of mood congruent recall on the quantity and accuracy of recall of negative life events. Forty-two college students received a negative or positive mood induction and then listened to narratives of 11 negative life events which mapped onto a well-known life events checklist measure. One week later, participants returned to the lab, received the same mood induction, and were asked to recall the narratives in open-ended recall and when using the life events checklist as a memory measure. There were no significant group differences on numerous measures of quantity and accuracy of recall including false memories. These results suggest that negative mood does not confer a recall advantage nor disadvantage for narratives of negative life events. Possible implications for depression and recall of negative life events are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {With a better understanding of the biologic basis of alcohol dependence and the considerable financial burden of alcohol abuse and dependence, the number of alcohol-related clinical pharmacotherapy trials has been on the rise. Subsequently, the potential to find efficacious treatments is more promising. Unfortunately, alcohol-related trials face a number of challenges, as a result of the difficulties that arise from traditional and outdated methods to collect data and ensure medication adherence. Novel technology-based assessments, such as ecological momentary assessment, interactive voice response, transdermal sensor and medication-event monitoring system provide a prospective solution—albeit not without possible concerns—to the difficulties faced in alcohol-related clinical trials. Clinical trials are meant to define the efficacy of the treatment and to determine an effective and safe dosage. However, due to lack of adherence a drug could inappropriately or mistakenly be judged as ineffective for treating a specific disorder. The described technologies may be important tools to prevent false negatives in validating drug efficacy, to provide consistency in clinical trials and to improve available data regarding the study of pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence.

Abstract = {Field inhomogeneities caused by variations in magnetic susceptibility throughout the head lead to geometric distortions, mainly in the phase‐encode direction of echo‐planar images (EPI). The magnitude and spatial characteristics of the distortions depend on the orientation of the head in the magnetic field and will therefore vary with head movement. A new method is presented, based on a phase informed model for motion and susceptibility (PIMMS), which estimates the change in geometric distortion associated with head motion. This method fits a model of the head motion parameters and scanner hardware characteristics to EPI phase time series. The resulting maps of the model fit parameters are used to correct for susceptibility artifacts in the magnitude images. Results are shown for EPI‐based fMRI time‐series acquired at 3T, demonstrating that compared with conventional rigid body realignment, PIMMS removes residual variance associated with motion‐related distortion effects. Furthermore, PIMMS can lead to a reduction in false negatives compared with the widely accepted approach which uses standard rigid body realignment and includes the head motion parameters in the statistical model. The PIMMS method can be used with any standard EPI sequence for which accurate phase information is available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Introduction: Sleep plays an important role in maintaining stability in bipolar disorders, and sleep disturbances can trigger mood episodes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder, yet the co-occurrence with bipolar disorder has not been methodically studied. Methods: This is a chart review of 482 consecutively seen patients with a bipolar disorder who underwent routine screening for OSA using a self-report sleep apnea questionnaire. Positive screens were referred for a sleep study. Results: A positive screen was found in 214 (44.4%) patients. Sleep studies were obtained on 114 patients, and 101, were diagnosed with OSA: point prevalence 21%. Discussion: The 21% prevalence fails to consider the false negative rate of the questionnaire, or the exclusion of patients who screened positive but failed to get a sleep study. Taking these into consideration it is estimated that the true prevalence of OSA in this study may be as high as 47.5%. The co-occurrence of OSA and bipolar disorders is markedly higher than previously thought. Of note, OSA may play a role in refractory bipolar, disorders, and carries significant mortality and morbidity that overlap, with the mortality and morbidity found with bipolar disorders. Limitations: This was a retrospective study based on a self-report questionnaire. Polysomnographic confirmation was performed in only a subgroup of subjects. Conclusions: The data suggest that unrecognized OSA may play a major role in the mortality and morbidity of bipolar disorders. All patients diagnosed with a bipolar disorder should be screened with an OSA questionnaire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Multi-source feedback (MSF) was intended to provide both a summative and formative assessment of doctors’ attitudes and behaviours. Aims: To explore the influences of feedback quality and trainees’ acceptance of the assessment on formative educational gains from MSF. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of eight dermatology trainees, from an insider researcher position, following two pilot interviews. Interviews were manually transcribed and coded to permit template analysis, a subtype of thematic analysis. Results: The interview data indicated that MSF provides relatively little formative educational gains largely because of a paucity of constructive feedback on sub-optimal performance. This was due to difficulties encountered by raters giving developmental feedback, in particular, potential loss of anonymity, and by trainees selecting raters expected to give favourable comments. Dual use of MSF as a summative assessment in annual appraisals also inhibited educational gains by promotion of a ‘tick box’ mentality in which trainees’ need to pass their assessment superseded their desire for self-improvement. Conclusions: A relative lack of developmental feedback limits the formative educational gains from MSF and could provide false reassurance that might reinforce negative behaviours.

Abstract = {Aims and objectives: This study compared readings from two professional-grade, commercially available infrared (IR) thermometers, the ThermoScan® PRO 4000 prewarmed tip ear thermometer and the Temporal ScannerTM TAT-5000 temporal artery thermometer. Background: The repeatability and precision of readings from IR thermometers for professional use were questioned in the past, but in recent years, these types of thermometers have been technologically improved, so their ability to replicate standard temperature readings reliably should be re-examined. Design: Febrile and afebrile children were recruited from the emergency department, overflow treatment areas and the paediatric intensive care unit of a large hospital in Argentina. Each child had a randomised sequence of seven temperature readings, including three from the ear, three from the forehead or behind the ear and one reference oral or rectal reading. Methods: Temperature readings were taken with the ThermoScan PRO 4000, the Temporal Scanner TAT-5000 and the monitor mode of SureTemp® Plus, a widely used professional-grade contact thermometer, for reference. Results: Of 205 children, 46% were febrile, per reference thermometer readings. While mean ThermoScan PRO 4000 febrile measurements did not differ significantly from reference, mean Temporal Scanner TAT-5000 febrile measurements were significantly lower (by a mean of 0·42 °C) than the reference. Overall bias of the ThermoScan PRO 4000 was significantly lower than that of the Temporal Scanner TAT-5000; repeatability was 1·5 times higher, and overall false-negative rate was about a third that of Temporal Scanner TAT-5000, when compared to the reference. Conclusions: This study indicates that the ThermoScan PRO 4000 provides measurements closer to those of a professional-grade contact thermometer when compared to the Temporal Scanner TAT-5000. Relevance to clinical practice: The odds of misclassifying a febrile child as non-febrile were about threefold higher with the Temporal Scanner TAT-5000 temporal artery thermometer than with the ThermoScan® PRO 4000 ear thermometer.

Abstract = {Objective: The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the suggested education correction on the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Method: Twenty-five outpatients with dementia and 39 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) underwent a diagnostic evaluation, which included the MoCA. Thirty-seven healthy controls also completed the MoCA and psychiatric, medical, neurological, functional, and cognitive difficulties were ruled out. Results: For the total MoCA score, unadjusted for education, a cut-off score of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (80% and 89% respectively) in identifying cognitive impairment (people with either dementia or aMCI, versus controls). When applying the education correction, sensitivity decreased from 80% to 69% for a small specificity increase (89% to 92%). The cut-off score yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity for the education adjusted MoCA score fell to 25 (61% and 97%, respectively). Conclusions: Adjusting the MoCA total score for education had a detrimental effect on sensitivity with only a slight increase in specificity. Clinically, this loss in sensitivity can lead to an increased number of false negatives, as education level does not always correlate to premorbid intellectual function. Clinical judgment about premorbid status should guide interpretation. However, as this effect may be cohort-specific, age and education corrected norms and cut-offs should be developed to help guide MoCA interpretation.

Abstract = {Interpersonal violence researchers have begun to focus on the role of perception of abuse experiences in post-abuse adjustment, and have posited that there may be something critical about a mismatch between having experienced abuse and actually labeling an experience as “abuse.” Utilizing cross-sectional data collected from outpatient HIV care settings, this study is the first to examine the role of abuse self-definition in HIV-positive gay and bisexual men. The sample (N = 166) was divided into participants who self-defined their experiences as abuse and those who did not. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of various factors (demographic, mental health, behavioral, and HIV health status) on the likelihood of self-defining child sexual abuse, child physical abuse, and partner abuse. Relationship to the perpetrator and characteristics of child sexual abuse experiences were explored as predictors of self-definition. Self-definition rates varied, with approximately 55% of child abuse victims and 24 to 31% of partner abuse victims labeling it as such. Participants who endorsed child sexual abuse experiences that involved force or coercion, and participants who reported a family member as the perpetrator, were more likely to define their experiences as abuse. These results suggest that screening for abuse history in clinical and research contexts should consistently utilize behaviorally anchored questions to minimize the likelihood of false negative reports. Further research is needed to better understand the process of labeling and the mechanisms underlying the labeling outcome relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a connective tissue disease affecting multiple organ systems and characterised by a chronic inflammatory process. It is considered a very serious sickness, further to be classified as an invalidating chronic disease. The recommended method for its detection is the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) based on Crithidia Luciliae (CL) substrate. Hoverer, IIF is affected by several issues limiting tests reliability and reproducibility. Hence, an evident medical demand is the development of computer-aided diagnosis tools that can offer a support to physician decision. Methods: In this paper we propose a system that classifies CL wells integrating information extracted from different images. It is based on three main decision phases. Two steps, named as threshold-based classification and single cells recognition, are applied for image classification. They minimise false negative and false positive classifications, respectively. Feature extraction and selection have been carried out to determine a compact set of descriptors to distinguish between positive and negative cells. The third step applies majority voting rule at well recognition level, enabling us to recover possible errors provided by previous phases. Results: The system performance have been evaluated on an annotated database of IIF CL wells, composed of 63 wells for a total of 342 images and 1487 cells. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of image recognition step are 99.4%, 98.6% and 99.6%, respectively. At level of well recognition, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 98.4%, 93.3% and 100.0%, respectively. The system has been also validated in a daily routine fashion on 48 consecutive analyses of hospital outpatients and inpatients. The results show very good performance for well recognition (100% of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), due to the integration of cells and images information. Conclusions: The described recognition system can be applied in daily routine in order to improve the reliability, standardisation and reproducibility of CL readings in IIF.

Abstract = {This study investigated the utility of self-report measures to screen for psychiatric comorbidities in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Thirty-eight 10–17 year olds with an ASD and without mental retardation completed: the Children’s Depression Inventory-Short version (CDI-S), Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Conners-Wells Adolescent Self-report Scale-Short edition (CASS-S), and Short Leyton Obsessional Inventory-Child Version (SLOI-CV). Their parents were interviewed with the Autism Comorbidity Interview-Present and Lifetime (ACI-PL) to establish psychiatric diagnoses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and reliability coefficients were calculated for each self-report and compared to values from literature. The CDI-S and CASS-S yielded a high number of false negatives, with lower sensitivities and specificities in the sample than the literature. There was a nearly significant difference in total mean RCMAS scores between participants with and without anxiety, though again the means for both groups were below the threshold of concern. The SLOI-CV yielded a high false positive rate. All four instruments had reliability coefficients comparable to literature values. Results must be considered preliminary due to sample size. However, the findings suggest that although self-report instruments may provide useful information in the diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidities in ASD, caution must be exercised in their interpretation.

Abstract = {The computerised-based Lucid Rapid Dyslexia Screening (Lucid Rapid) used for the speedy identification of children at risk of literacy difficulties or dyslexia has been employed as part of the dyslexia awareness drive organised by the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) to identify Singapore children who may be at risk of literacy difficulties or dyslexia. In view of a lack of research on the Lucid Rapid, this study explored the effectiveness of the Lucid Rapid in the screening of children at risk of literacy difficulties or dyslexia in the Singaporean context. In this exploratory study, a sample of 127 children aged between 6 years to 12 years 2 months was each administered the Lucid Rapid. This was followed by formal assessments conducted at the DAS or external agencies, comprising of cognitive and literacy assessments as well as phonological tests. As part of the formal assessment, a full background history was taken of each child including educational history and teachers' reports. Data from this sample showed that children found to be at risk of dyslexia on the Lucid Rapid were likely to be diagnosed to be dyslexic. However, concerns were raised on the large number of children who were misclassified falling within the false positive (misclassifying children to be at risk of dyslexia when they are not dyslexic) and false negative (misclassifying children to be at low risk of dyslexia when they are dyslexic) groups. In this sample, phonological processing, auditory sequential memory and phonic decoding, but not visual-verbal integration memory, on the Lucid Rapid positively correlated with comparable measures in formal assessments. As compared to the true negative group (children classified to be at low risk of dyslexia and not diagnosed to be dyslexic), the false negative group showed lower phonic decoding and auditory sequential memory scores. Risk levels on the Lucid Rapid have been found to be negatively correlated with a number of cognitive, literacy and phonological measures. The children's home language usage might also affect the Lucid Rapid results to some extent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The diagnostic boundary between major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult and also one of the most important in psychiatry: difficult because the distinction rests on the definition and elusive diagnosis of a hypomanic episode; important because the choice of diagnosis determines very different treatment approaches. DSM–IV expanded bipolar disorder by adding bipolar II disorder. DSM-5 is considering a further expansion of bipolar disorder by lowering the definitional threshold for a hypomanic episode. We will discuss the pros and cons of including bipolar II disorder in DSM–IV, the unintended consequences of this decision, the risk ⁄ benefit ratio of expanding the boundaries of bipolar disorder, and why the DSM-5 proposal is a bad idea. The DSM–IV Mood Disorders Work Group was very concerned about the puzzling question of how best to classify depressed individuals whose illness histories are punctuated by hypomanic episodes. Three alternatives were proposed: (i) to keep things as they had been in DSM-III-R, which classified boundary cases within unipolar major depressive disorder; (ii) to add a bipolar II disorder category that would switch the boundary cases into the bipolar spectrum; or (iii) to indecisively split the difference by adding a specifier 'with hypomanic episodes' to major depressive disorder. The DSM-5 Mood Disorders Work Group is considering two possible ways of lowering the diagnostic threshold for defining a hypomanic episode: (i) reducing the duration requirement for a hypomanic episode to 2 days (now set at 4 days by DSM–IV); and (ii) allowing hypomania to be diagnosed just on the basis of increased energy ⁄ activity (no longer requiring the presence of elevated mood or irritability). DSM-5 is greatly overestimating the risks of false-negative mistakes and underestimating the risks of false-positive diagnosis. The doubling of the rate of bipolar diagnosis during the past 15 years has certainly tilted the odds that relaxing the criteria will result in further over-diagnosis. Until we have a much deeper understanding of the different pathogeneses of unipolar versus bipolar disorder, this crucial distinction must be based exclusively on clinical judgment using the admittedly arbitrary DSM rules of thumb that define the symptoms and duration of a hypomanic episode. Any decisions lowering the symptom and duration requirements for a hypomanic episode will feed what has already become a bipolar fad. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The response-signal speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure was used to provide an indepth investigation of the impact of aging on the dynamics of short-term memory retrieval. Young and older adults studied sequentially presented 3-item lists, immediately followed by a recognition probe. Analyses of composite list and serial position SAT functions found no differences in overall accuracy, but indicated slower retrieval speed for older adults. Analysis of false alarms to recent negatives (lures from the previous study list) revealed no differences in the timing or magnitude of early false alarms that are thought to reflect familiarity-based judgments. However, onset and accrual of recollective processing required for resolving interference was slower for older adults. These findings suggest that older adults have a selective impairment on controlled and recollective retrieval operations, and further specify this impairment to arise primarily from delayed onset of cognitive control potentially coupled with reduced availability of recollective information.

Abstract = {Interregional connections of the brain measured with diffusion tractography can be used to infer valuable information regarding both brain structure and function. However, different tractography algorithms can generate networks that exhibit different characteristics, resulting in poor reproducibility across studies. Therefore, it is important to benchmark different tractography algorithms to quantitatively assess their performance. Here we systematically evaluated a newly introduced tracking algorithm, global tractography, to derive anatomical brain networks in a fiber phantom, 2 post-mortem macaque brains, and 20 living humans, and compared the results with an established local tracking algorithm. Our results demonstrated that global tractography accurately characterized the phantom network in terms of graph-theoretic measures, and significantly outperformed the local tracking approach. Results in brain tissues (post-mortem macaques and in vivo humans), however, showed that although the performance of global tractography demonstrated a trend of improvement, the results were not vastly different than that of local tractography, possibly resulting from the increased fiber complexity of real tissues. When using macaque tracer-derived connections as the ground truth, we found that both global and local algorithms generated non-random patterns of false negative and false positive connections that were probably related to specific fiber systems and largely independent of the tractography algorithm or tissue type (post-mortem vs. in vivo) used in the current study. Moreover, a close examination of the transcallosal motor connections, reconstructed via either global or local tractography, demonstrated that the lateral transcallosal fibers in humans and macaques did not exhibit the denser homotopic connections found in primate tracer studies, indicating the need for more robust brain mapping techniques based on diffusion MRI data.

Abstract = {Objective: The Learned Resourcefulness Scale has been utilized to measure self-control in research in Turkey. However, this scale may not be appropriate to measure the trait of self-control. For this reason, we aimed to adapt the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS), which was developed by Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone (2004), into Turkish. Methods:The validity and reliability tests were conducted with 523 participants who were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder. Discriminant validity was investigated by assessment with the BSCS, the social skills subscale of the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale (TSIS), the controlling negative body responses and anger management subscales of the Emotional Management Skills Scale (EMSS), and the 8IS-11 on 36 euthymic bipolar I disorder patients (according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria) and 50 individuals without a psychiatric diagnosis. Test-retest reliability was done with 145 people who were chosen from among the 523 participants. Results: For language equivalency of the BSCS, the relationships between the English and Turkish versions of the BSCS were investigated using Pearson correlation and they were found to be r = 0.72 for impulsiveness, r = 0.76 for self-discipline, and r = 0.73 for the total scale. To determine the factor structure of the BSCS, principal component analysis and varimax were used, and the analysis yielded two-factors called impulsiveness and self-discipline. The two-factor structure of the BSCS was confirmed by confirmation factor analysis. For criterion-related validity, correlations among subscales of the BSCS and social skills of the TSIS, controlling negative body responses and anger management subscales of the EMSS and the BIS-11 were utilized. They ranged from r = -0.11 to r = 0.64 for impulsiveness, and r = 0.19 to r = 0.63 for self-discipline. The discriminant ability of impulsivity and self-discipline between euthymic bipolar I disorder patients and individuals without any psychiatric diagnosis were investigated by using discriminant analysis and it was confirmed that they could discriminate. ROC analysis indicated that impulsiveness and self-discipline differentiated between euthymic bipolar I disorder patients and the individuals without psychiatric diagnosis (area under the curve 0.85 and 0.82, respectively), while the BSCS Total did not differentiate (area under the curve 0.56). Using a cut-off score of 13 for impulsiveness, sensitivity was 0.806, specificity was 0.84, positive predictive value was 0.04, negative predictive value was 0.99, positive likelihood ratio was 5.03, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.23. Using a cut-off score of 12 for self-discipline, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 0.917, 0.62,0.02,0.99,2.41 and 0.13, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated that the BSCS is a reliable and valid instrument. On the other hand, utilizing the scale as a part of a screening process rather than a diagnostic or sole screening tool would be better, as positive and negative predictive values indicated that there was a fair percentage of false negatives and positives.

Abstract = {Objective: Data about Arab-Americans, a growing ethnic minority, are not routinely collected in vital statistics, registry, or administrative data in the USA. The difficulty in identifying Arab-Americans using publicly available data sources is a barrier to health research about this group. Here, we validate an empirically based probabilistic Arab name algorithm (ANA) for identifying Arab-Americans in health research. Design: We used data from all Michigan birth certificates between 2000 and 2005. Fathers' surnames and mothers' maiden names were coded as Arab or non-Arab according to the ANA. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of Arab ethnicity inferred using the ANA as compared to self-reported Arab ancestry. Results: Statewide, the ANA had a specificity of 98.9%, a sensitivity of 50.3%, a PPV of 57.0%, and an NPV of 98.6%. Both the false-positive and false-negative rates were higher among men than among women. As the concentration of Arab-Americans in a study locality increased, the ANA false-positive rate increased and false-negative rate decreased. Conclusion: The ANA is highly specific but only moderately sensitive as a means of detecting Arab ancestry. Future research should compare health characteristics among Arab-American populations defined by Arab ancestry and those defined by the ANA.

Abstract = {Recently, a debate has emerged on the use and necessity of standardization in experimental testing using animal subjects. The difficulties encountered when trying to reconcile standardization and generalization largely underlie this debate. The more specific the testing procedures are, the less one can generalize to more naturalistic situations, including to human clinical populations. If the goal of a study is to generalize to a larger population, there may be a higher risk attached to false-positive than false-negative results; thus the balance sways toward generalization. Heterogenization of housing conditions and of genetic makeup of experimental animals has been suggested as a possible method to increase the generalizability of results. It is important to remain cognizant, however, of situations in which false negatives can be counterproductive or even dangerous, such as when the goal is to elucidate a physiological mechanism, when expected effect sizes are small, in toxicological studies and in drug safety testing. In such cases, experiments based on standardization may provide more useful information. We pose that it is essential that the goal of the specific experiment conducted is clearly defined and that the decision to balance between standardization and generalization must be made based on the specific needs to meet the intended goal. In this light, we discuss a multi-tiered approach to animal experimentation, in which standardization and generalizability are each given precedence during different phases of a project, depending upon the goal of the experiment.

Abstract = {Background: This study examines the clinical accuracy of movement disorder specialists in distinguishing tremor dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD) from other tremulous movement disorders by the use of standardised patient videos. Patients and methods: Two movement disorder specialists were asked to distinguish TDPD from patients with atypical tremor and dystonic tremor, who had no evidence of presynaptic dopaminergic deficit (subjects without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDDs)) according to ¹²³I-N-ω-fluoro-propyl- 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane ([¹²³I] FP-CIT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), by ‘blinded’ video analysis in 38 patients. A diagnosis of parkinsonism was made if the step 1 criteria of the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria for Parkinson's disease were fulfilled. The reviewer diagnosis was compared with the working clinical diagnosis drawn from the medical history, SPECT scan result, long term follow-up and in some cases the known response to dopaminergic medications. This comparison allowed a calculation for false positive and false negative rate of diagnosis of PD. Results: High false positive (17.4-26.1%) and negative (6.7-20%) rates were found for the diagnosis of PD. The diagnostic distinction of TDPD from dystonic tremor was reduced by the presence of dystonic features in treated and untreated PD patients. Conclusion: Clinical distinction of TDPD from atypical tremor, monosymptomatic rest tremor and dystonic tremor can be difficult due to the presence of parkinsonian features in tremulous SWEDD patients. The diagnosis of bradykinesia was particularly challenging. This study highlights the difficulty of differentiation of some cases of SWEDD from PD.

Abstract = {This study examined the influence of emotional valence on the production of DRM false memories (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Participants were presented with neutral, positive, or negative DRM lists for a later recognition (Experiment 1) or recall (Experiment 2) test. In both experiments, confidence and recollective experience (i.e., “Remember-Know” judgments; Tulving, 1985) were also assessed. Results consistently showed that, compared with neutral lists, affective lists induced more false recognition and recall of nonpresented critical lures. Moreover, although confidence ratings did not differ between the false remembering from the different kinds of lists, “Remember” responses were more often associated with negative than positive and neutral false remembering of the critical lures. In contrast, positive false remembering of the critical lures was more often associated with “Know” responses. These results are discussed in light of the Paradoxical Negative Emotion (PNE) hypothesis (Porter, Taylor, & ten Bricke, 2008). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to validate brief intake screens for serious mental illnesses among New Zealand male prisoners. Methods: A prospective survey of consecutively admitted male remanded and sentenced prisoners was conducted across two New Zealand sites. Participants completed the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS) and the English Mental Health Screen (EMHS) upon prison admission. The validation standard, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), was completed for all positive screens and a random selection of negative screens. Results: A total of 1,292 brief screens and 530 MINI screens were completed. Fifty-one percent of the participants met MINI criteria for one of five targeted major mental disorders. In this study, the BJMHS performed with lower sensitivity, higher specificity, a lower false-positive rate, a significantly higher false-negative rate, and a much higher referral rate than in the validating U.S. study. And in this study the EMHS performed with lower sensitivity, less specificity, higher false-positive and false-negative rates, and a moderately higher overall referral rate than in the validating U.K. study. For the BJMHS and EMHS, the majority of false-negative cases involved a mood disorder and few involved psychosis. Conclusions: Although the BJMHS and EMHS did not perform well in terms of screening for MINI diagnoses, they appeared to be good at identifying a core group of prisoners who are psychotic and most likely to require urgent or semi-urgent intervention by mental health services. The most favorable clinical outcomes were achieved by defining a positive screen as one in which either the EMHS or the BJMHS criteria were fulfilled.

Abstract = {Objective: Disruption of the sense of agency and of being causally determinant in action was explored in the present research by inducing an erroneous external spatial feedback in response to the subject’s behaviour. Methods: ERPs and theta frequency band oscillation (ERD) were recorded from 15 subjects when they were receiving mismatching/matching feedback information. In addition, subjective sensitivity to the external cues was monitored by BIS (Behavioral Inibition System) and BAS (Behavioral Activation System) measures. Results: One negative ERP deflection of higher amplitude was revealed in response to false feedback, peaking at 210ms post-stimulus, central-posteriorly localized. A specific cortical network, more central-posteriorly distributed, seems to be implicated. Moreover, theta synchronization was observed in response to false feedback within the posterior cortical site. Conclusions: A direct relationship between ERP/theta band oscillation was supposed, as a marker of salient and unattended cues that produce an alerting response. Moreover, BIS showed an enhanced response to external feedback, and specifically to false feedback, with an increased negative deflection and theta frequency band effect. Significance: ERP negativity may represent a monitoring system, comparable with erroneous feedback effect. Moreover, specific motivation towards negative context was related to higher BIS, since they were more sensitive to negative, false outcome.

Abstract = {Objectives: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of 1.5-T and 3.0-T diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to detect hyperacute ischemic stroke lesions. Methods: We blindly reviewed the DWI of 135 acute stroke patients and 34 controls performed at 1.5 T (n = 108) or 3.0 T (n = 61). The stroke patients all had subsequently proved carotid territory ischemic stroke and were imaged within the first 6 hours after stroke onset. Four readers (2 neuroradiologists and 2 stroke neurologists) blinded to clinical data and magnetic field strength recorded the presence of ischemic lesions on DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps if necessary. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rates were computed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and DWI contrasts were calculated at both field strengths. Results: The accuracy of DWI in stroke diagnosis was superior at 1.5 T (98.8%) than at 3.0 T (90.9%, p = 0.03). The sensitivity decreased from 99.1% at 1.5 T to 92.5% at 3.0 T (p = 0.06) and the specificity from 97.8% to 84.1% (p = 0.002). ADC map readings did not improve accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity. The false-negative rate was 0.6% at 1.5 T and 6.1% at 3.0 T. Type of readers, stroke severity, and type of the coil did not affect diagnosis value. SNR and CNR were significantly higher at 3 T (p < 0.0001) but DWI contrast was lower (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Blind reading by 4 experts of a large series of images shows that 1.5-T diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is better than 3.0-T DWI for the imaging of hyperacute stroke during the therapeutic window of thrombolysis.

Abstract = {Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an appropriate method for the evaluation of axillary status in cases of early breast cancer. We report our experience in treating cases evaluated using SLNB. We analyzed a total of 1192 cases assessed by means of SLNB from July 1999 to December 2007. SLNB processing was successfully completed in 1154 cases with the use of blue dye or radiolabeled ⁹⁹mTc-Dextran-500, or both. Of these 1154 patients, 857 were N0(i-) (no regional lymph node metastasis, negative immunohistochemistry, IHC), 96 were N0(i+) (no regional lymph node metastasis histologically, positive IHC, no IHC cluster greater than 0.2 mm) and 201 were N1mi (greater than 0.2 mm, none greater than 2.0 mm). Most of the tumors (70%) were invasive ductal carcinomas and tumors were staged as T1 in 770 patients (65%). A total of 274 patients underwent SLNB and axillary dissections up to April 2003. The inclusion criteria were tumor size equal to or less than 3 cm in diameter, no clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes, no neoadjuvant therapy. In 19 cases, the SLN could not be identified intraoperatively. A false-negative rate of 11% and a negative predictive value of 88.2% were obtained for the 255 assessable patients. The overall concordance between SLNB and axillary lymph node status was 92%. SLNB sensitivity for nodes was 81% and specificity was 100%. The higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and lower false-negative rates of SLNB suggest that this method may be an appropriate alternative to total axillary dissection in early breast cancer patients.

Abstract = {When mental health, medical, and social work professionals and paraprofessionals make false positive or false negative errors in their judgments about the validity of allegations of child sexual abuse, the consequences can be catastrophic for the affected children and adults. Because of the high stakes, practitioners, legal decision makers, and policy makers should have some idea of the magnitude and variability of error rates in this domain. A novel approach was used to estimate individual error rates for 110 professionals (psychologists, physicians, social workers, and others) who conduct or participate in forensic child sexual abuse evaluations. The median estimated false positive and false negative error rates were 0.18 and 0.36, respectively. Estimated error rates varied markedly from one participant to the next. For example, the false positive error rate estimates ranged from 0.00 to 0.83. These estimates are based on participants’ self-reported substantiation rates and on their subjective frequency distributions for the probability of truth for the abuse allegations they evaluate.

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that survival-related processing of word lists enhances retention for that material. However, the claim that survival-related memories are more accurate has only been examined when true recall and recognition of neutral material has been measured. In the current experiments, we examined the adaptive memory superiority effect for different types of processing and material, measuring accuracy more directly by comparing true and false recollection rates. Survival-related information and processing was examined using word lists containing backward associates of neutral, negative, and survival-related critical lures and type of processing (pleasantness, moving, survival) was varied using an incidental memory paradigm. Across four experiments, results showed that survival-related words were more susceptible than negative and neutral words to the false memory illusion and that processing information in terms of its relevance to survival independently increased this susceptibility to the false memory illusion. Overall, although survival- related processing and survival-related information resulted in poorer, not more accurate, memory, such inaccuracies may have adaptive significance. These findings are discussed in the context of false memory research and recent theories concerning the importance of survival processing and the nature of adaptive memory.

Abstract = {Currently There are two research strands regarding false memory. First, there are how to decrease false memory and, second, how to understand the development of false memory. At the. first aspect, a few of reports showed some perceived features, such as colour and location, could covertly contribute to false memories. This was not in accordance with fuzzy-trace theory's prediction which suggested that more perceived features would decrease false memory. More recently, research demonstrated false memory for the semantically related unpresented items increased with age. We hypothesized that i. specific visual features which provide specific information would decrease false memory, but nonspecific visual features would increase false memory; and that ii. younger children's false memory would be less influenced than older children from the two kinds of features as cues. 144 children, divided into groups aged 8-, 10-, and 12-years of age, took part in two experiments. DRM paradigm was used in both. In the first, we examined the effects of specific visual features of a picture on false memory. In the second , we investigated how the location of words (nonspecific visual features) influence false memory. We found the false alarm rates of critical lures increased from 8 to 12 to a statistically significant extent. We also found specific visual feature had a positive effect false memory which increases with age—with no significant effect on 8-years-olds, and with no significant difference between the false alarm rates of critical lures of 10 year olds and children of 12 years of age. Nonspecific visual feature had negative effect on false memory but no significant effect on the 8 year old group. The negative effect on the false memory of the 10 and 12 years old group were significantly different. The results indicate that false memory, induced by DRM paradigm, increases from 8 to 12. This may be due to children of 8 years of age being unable to 'get the gist' of the semantically related words and connect them and that this ability will increase as they get older. The visual features, no matter specific or nonspecific, seem to have no influence on children of 8 years old, but have significant effect on children of 10 and 12 years of age. The impairing effect secondary to specific visual features on false memory rises from age 8 to 10 but further from 10 to 12. This may be because this impaired effect is related to the ability to form the 'verbatim trace'. The increasing effect brought by nonspecific visual features on false memory rises from age 8 to 12 suggesting that the ability to 'get the gist' of semantically related words and connect increases across these age groups.

Abstract = {The present study examined the effect of the social context on early emotional appraisal of performance errors and negative feedback reflected by the error-related negativity (ERN), feedback-related negativity (FRN), and P300. Participants performed a probabilistic learning task in which they received valid and invalid performance feedback. During one half of the task they were led to believe that they were competing online against another participant. As expected, the ERN following response errors was enhanced in the competition compared to the neutral condition. The FRN was more negative following negative compared to positive feedback and valid compared to invalid feedback, but only during competition. The P300 was larger to false positive than false negative feedback, which was independent of the social context. In conclusion, ERN and FRN, but not P300, may be sensitive to affective distress elicited by expectation violations during social interaction.

Abstract = {Objective: Hospital discharge registers (HDRs) are frequently used in epidemiological research. However, the validity of several important psychiatric diagnostic entities, including bipolar disorder, remains uncertain. Hence, we aimed to develop an optimal algorithm for register-based identification of DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorder. Method: We identified potential cases in the Swedish national HDR using two separate discharge diagnoses of bipolar disorder according to ICD versions 8–10 during January 1, 1973 to December 31, 2004. In a randomly selected subsample of 135 cases from the county of Sörmland, two senior psychiatrists reassessed the diagnostic status based on patients' medical records. We scrutinized false-positive cases and modified the initial algorithm to improve positive predictive value while minimizing false negatives. Finally, we externally validated resulting caseness algorithms by linking HDR diagnostic data with best-estimate clinical diagnoses from the National Quality Assurance Register for Bipolar Disorder (BipoläR), dispensed lithium prescriptions from the National Prescribed Drug Register, and the ICD-10 diagnoses from the National Outpatient Register respectively. Results: The algorithm with two discharge diagnoses of bipolar disorder yielded a positive predictive value of 0.81. Modification by excluding individuals diagnosed with ICD-8 296.20 (manic-depressive psychosis, depressed type), and/or ICD-9 296.B (unipolar affective psychosis, melancholic form), gave a positive positive predictive value of 0.92. The modified algorithm also had statistically superior external validity compared with the original algorithm. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorder caseness based on two inpatient episodes with a bipolar disorder diagnosis is sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used in further epidemiological study of bipolar disorder.

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Steven C. Palmer (see record [rid]2014-35901-013[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2014-19001-001[/rid]). The authors cannot agree more that the implications and interpretations of a study should be based on transparency in reporting and possible bias. A certain number of non- responders may influence confidence and the generalizability of the outcomes. However, this was a real-world study and we cannot change the reality that many cancer patients or their family members refused psychiatric consultation and advice. The researchers and clinicians could not force the patients to take part in a diagnostic follow-up interview although we tried our best to convince them. We truly hope that someday, advances in psycho-oncology will improve this situation. The authors do not agree that ‘the TDQ was set such that false negatives were unlikely, but provide no data to support this’. The authors did attempt to provide regular screening and diagnostic interviews for all screen-positive cancer inpatients. Palmer was concerned about the low referral rate in stage 2. However, the authors had no clues that the non-referred patients would have a higher or lower probability of being depressed; that is, this might imply an undifferentiated bias. The authors do not agree that ‘these data simply do not allow conclusions about either diagnostic accuracy or appropriate cut-points to be drawn’, either. The authors are convinced that the three-stage method utilized in the study is of value in improving the recognition of depressive disorders in cancer patients and may be mandated in real-world cancer care.

Abstract = {Whole brain fMRI analyses rarely include the entire brain because of missing data that result from data acquisition limits and susceptibility artifact, in particular. This missing data problem is typically addressed by omitting voxels from analysis, which may exclude brain regions that are of theoretical interest and increase the potential for Type II error at cortical boundaries or Type I error when spatial thresholds are used to establish significance. Imputation could significantly expand statistical map coverage, increase power, and enhance interpretations of fMRI results. We examined multiple imputation for group level analyses of missing fMRI data using methods that leverage the spatial information in fMRI datasets for both real and simulated data. Available case analysis, neighbor replacement, and regression based imputation approaches were compared in a general linear model framework to determine the extent to which these methods quantitatively (effect size) and qualitatively (spatial coverage) increased the sensitivity of group analyses. In both real and simulated data analysis, multiple imputation provided 1) variance that was most similar to estimates for voxels with no missing data, 2) fewer false positive errors in comparison to mean replacement, and 3) fewer false negative errors in comparison to available case analysis. Compared to the standard analysis approach of omitting voxels with missing data, imputation methods increased brain coverage in this study by 35% (from 33,323 to 45,071 voxels). In addition, multiple imputation increased the size of significant clusters by 58% and number of significant clusters across statistical thresholds, compared to the standard voxel omission approach. While neighbor replacement produced similar results, we recommend multiple imputation because it uses an informed sampling distribution to deal with missing data across subjects that can include neighbor values and other predictors. Multiple imputation is anticipated to be particularly useful for 1) large fMRI data sets with inconsistent missing voxels across subjects and 2) addressing the problem of increased artifact at ultra-high field, which significantly limit the extent of whole brain coverage and interpretations of results.

Abstract = {Brain fingerprinting (BF) detects concealed information stored in the brain by measuring brainwaves. A specific EEG event-related potential, a P300-MERMER, is elicited by stimuli that are significant in the present context. BF detects P300-MERMER responses to words/pictures relevant to a crime scene, terrorist training, bomb-making knowledge, etc. BF detects information by measuring cognitive information processing. BF does not detect lies, stress, or emotion. BF computes a determination of "information present" or "information absent" and a statistical confidence for each individual determination. Laboratory and field tests at the FBI, CIA, US Navy and elsewhere have resulted in 0% errors: no false positives and no false negatives. 100% of determinations made were correct. 3% of results have been "indeterminate." BF has been applied in criminal cases and ruled admissible in court. Scientific standards for BF tests are discussed. Meeting the BF scientific standards is necessary for accuracy and validity. Alternative techniques that failed to meet the BF scientific standards produced low accuracy and susceptibility to countermeasures. BF is highly resistant to countermeasures. No one has beaten a BF test with countermeasures, despite a $100,000 reward for doing so. Principles of applying BF in the laboratory and the field are discussed.

Abstract = {The interpretation of forensic fingerprint evidence relies on the expertise of latent print examiners. We tested latent print examiners on the extent to which they reached consistent decisions. This study assessed intra-examiner repeatability by retesting 72 examiners on comparisons of latent and exemplar fingerprints, after an interval of approximately seven months; each examiner was reassigned 25 image pairs for comparison, out of total pool of 744 image pairs. We compare these repeatability results with reproducibility (inter-examiner) results derived from our previous study. Examiners repeated 89.1% of their individualization decisions, and 90.1% of their exclusion decisions; most of the changed decisions resulted in inconclusive decisions. Repeatability of comparison decisions (individualization, exclusion, inconclusive) was 90.0% for mated pairs, and 85.9% for nonmated pairs. Repeatability and reproducibility were notably lower for comparisons assessed by the examiners as "difficult" than for "easy" or "moderate" comparisons, indicating that examiners’ assessments of difficulty may be useful for quality assurance. No false positive errors were repeated (n = 4); 30% of false negative errors were repeated. One percent of latent value decisions were completely reversed (no value even for exclusion vs. of value for individualization). Most of the inter- and intra-examiner variability concerned whether the examiners considered the information available to be sufficient to reach a conclusion; this variability was concentrated on specific image pairs such that repeatability and reproducibility were very high on some comparisons and very low on others. Much of the variability appears to be due to making categorical decisions in borderline cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Study Objectives: To examine the impact of using a nasal pressure sensor only vs the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommended combination of thermal and nasal pressure sensors on (1) the apnea index (AI), (2) the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), where the AHI is calculated using both AASM definitions of hypopnea, and (3) the accuracy of a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Design: Retrospective review of previously scored in-laboratory polysomnography. Setting: A tertiary-hospital clinical sleep laboratory. Patients or Participants: One hundred sixty-four consecutive adult patients with a potential diagnosis of OSA, who were examined during a 3-month period. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Studies were scored with and without the use of the oronasal thermal sensor. AIs and AHIs, using the nasal pressure sensor alone (AInp and AHInp), were compared with those using both a thermal sensor for the detection of apnea and a nasal pressure transducer for the detection of hypopnea (AIth and AHIth). Comparisons were repeated using the AASM recommended (AASMrec) and alternative (AASMalt) hypopnea definitions. AI was significantly different when measured from the different sensors, with AInp being 51% higher on average. Using the AASMrec hypopnea definition, the mean AHInp was 15% larger than the AHIth; with large interindividual differences and an estimated 9.8% of patients having a false-positive OSA diagnosis at a cutpoint of 15 events and 4.3% at 30 events per hour. Using AASMalt hypopnea definition, the mean AHInp was 3% larger than the AHIth, with estimated false-positive rates of 4.6% and 2.4%, respectively. The false-negative rate was negligible at 0.1% for both hypopnea definitions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that using only a nasal pressure sensor for the detection of apnea resulted in higher values of AI and AHI than when the AASM recommended thermal sensor was added to detect apnea. When the AASMalt hypopnea definition was used, the differences in AHI and subsequent OSA diagnosis were small and less than when the AASMrec hypopnea definition was used. In situations in which a thermal sensor cannot be used, for example, in limited-channel diagnostic devices, the AHI obtained with a nasal pressure sensor alone differs less from the AHI obtained from a polysomnogram that includes a thermal sensor when the AASMalt definition rather than the AASMrec definition of hypopnea is used. Thus, diagnostic accuracy is impacted both by the absence of the thermal sensor and by the rules used to analyze the polysomnography. Furthermore, where the thermal sensor is unreliable for sections of a study, it is likely that use of the nasal pressure signal to detect apnea will have modest impact.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Francisca T. de Bruine et al. (see record [rid]2013-13303-012[/rid]). The paper by Bruine et al. is interesting for several reasons. Bruine et al. higher intensity neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3T instead of commonly used 1.5T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography data were quantifed, a high percentage of the children were followed-up to 2 years of age and DTI results, independent from other clinical factors in the neonatal period, accurately predicted neurodevelopmental outcome. Although the relationship between perinatal/neonatal brain injury and subsequent neurological deficits in preterm infants is well established, there are exceptions. Some infants with brain injury develop normally while others without visible brain injury have neurological deficits. Although these false positive and false negative cases are uncommon, they have been used by health policy makers to argue against universal neonatal brain imaging in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. The cost of brain MRI is high and is not available in every hospital. Early detection and intervention in cases of language impairment can have tremendous long-term benefits.

Abstract = {The Registered Reports format has several attractive characteristics. First, it will be immune to publication bias because the decision to accept or reject manuscripts will be based on the significance of the research question and validity of the methods, never on whether results are novel or statistically significant. Second, by requiring authors to adhere to a pre-approved methodology and analysis pipeline, it will instantly prevent a host of questionable but common practices that promote false discoveries, including p value fishing, creative outlier exclusion, and selective reporting of analyses. Third, by requiring an a priori power analysis, including a minimum power level of 90%, false negatives will be greatly reduced compared with standard empirical reports. Not all modes of scientific investigation will be compatible with the Registered Reports initiative, and we will be maintaining all of our existing publishing options. However, for most types of studies, Registered Reports will not outlaw serendipity or hinder legitimate scientific flexibility. Authors will be welcome to include post hoc analyses that were not mentioned in pre-registered submissions. Such analyses will simply be distinguished from those that were planned in advance, and authors will not be able to revise their hypotheses to predict unexpected outcomes. In the coming months we will formulate detailed author and reviewer guidelines for Registered Reports. We look forward to launching this exciting new platform and welcome contributions to the discussion from our readers and the broader scientific community.

Abstract = {Objective: The WHO guidelines for children less than 18 months old diagnosed with HIV based on presumptive clinical diagnosis or one virologic test recommend confirmatory HIV antibody testing after 18 months of age. This study describes post- 18-month HIV test results following this WHO-recommended confirmatory testing strategy. Design: Case series and retrospective review of routine program data. Methods: Children enrolled at the Baylor Children’s Clinical Center of Excellence, a pediatric and family HIV clinic in Maseru, Lesotho from December 2005 through January 2009 with a positive HIV DNA PCR at less than 18 months of age and HIV rapid test results after 18 months of age were included. Post-18-month confirmatory HIV test results are described. Factors associated with non-positive confirmatory rapid tests were determined using binary logistic regression. Results: Of the 109 children meeting inclusion criteria, 22 (20.2%) had negative and 27 (24.8%) discordant confirmatory rapid tests. Forty-six of these 49 were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among these 49, 11 of 24 post-18-month HIV DNA PCRs were negative, whereas nine of 10 post-18-month HIV ELISAs were positive; 29 were definitively and 17 probably HIV-infected, two were uninfected, and one had undetermined status. Only age less than 9 months at ART initiation (odds ratio 4.25, P¼0.002) was associated with non-positive rapid tests. Conclusion: False-negative post-18-month confirmatory rapid tests and HIV DNA PCRs in children on ART are common, associated with early ART initiation, and may lead to inappropriate ART discontinuation and discharge from care of truly HIV-infected children.

Abstract = {Presents a case report of 49-year-old woman with a past medical history of migraine headaches and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was presented to an emergency department after a four day history of bumping into walls. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomogram (CT) angiography demonstrated an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right occipital lobe, with no evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. The patient was discharged home for follow-up at an outpatient neurovascular disease clinic. At one-month follow-up, the patient reported a persisting visual field defect. Repeat MR imaging demonstrated a large region of decreased ADC in the right parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, predominantly in the white matter. Electroencephalogrphy demonstrated intermittent abnormal spikes over the right parietal and occipital lobes, but no activity suggestive of status epilepticus. At two-month follow-up, the MR imaging demonstrated normalization of the ADC maps. Histopathological evaluation revealed variably thick walled vessels with numerous neutrophils adhered to the endothelial surface. This study have described a case of false negative ischemia on diffusion-weighted images caused by a balance of hypointensity on T2-weighted images and decreased ADC, that is, a pattern of "T2-dark restricted diffusion." The pattern is clinically important as one may falsely interpret such diffusion-weighted images as negative for cytotoxic edema. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reports an error in "A non-standard method for estimating accuracy of lie detection techniques demonstrated on a self-validating set of field polygraph examinations" by Avital Ginton (Psychology, Crime & Law, 2013[Aug], Vol 19[7], 577-594). In the original article, one of the reference was omitted. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-26664-003[/rid]). A unique method for estimating field accuracy of the Comparison Question Test (CQT)—a polygraph technique is presented, based on a combined probabilistic and algebraic model. It is built on paired examinations in criminal cases in which two opposing versions per case have been subjected to polygraph tests. The developed model is ground-truth free, thus there was no need to rely on external criteria of deception (e.g., confessions or physical evidence) in estimating the accuracy of the CQT. Results indicate an accuracy rate of 0.94 in detecting guilty examinees (Sensitivity) with a 0.06 False Negative rate and an accuracy rate of 0.835 (Specificity) with False Positive of 0.165 for the innocents. These figures excluded 20% of the cases that were ruled inconclusive. When no inconclusive calls were allowed, the accuracy rate dropped down to 0.8 with 0.2 error rates for both the guilty and the innocent examinees. The importance of this research stems from its being a field study that due to the unique methodology was not subjected to weaknesses usually found in polygraph field validity studies. This method is applicable to other techniques of deception detection and with some necessary adaptations may be also to eyewitness situations.

Abstract = {Background: The lack of psychometric measures of psychopathology especially in intellectual disabilities (ID) population was addressed by creation of the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule for Adult with Developmental Disability (PAS-ADD-10) in Moss et al. This schedule is a structured interview designed for professionals in psychopathology. The PAS-ADD Checklist was created as a screening tool designed for non-specialists in mental illness, such as families and care staff. The Checklist includes 29 symptoms items graded on a four-point scale. When the score passes the threshold, this indicates the need for further psychiatric assessment. In a study by Moss et al. and a replication by Sturmey et al., the PAS-ADD Checklist was validated and proved reliable as a screening tool for psychiatric disorders in a population of adults with ID. In this study, the French translation of the Checklist is compared with the English version and the psychometric properties are presented for outpatients. Method: The French version was created by translation and back translation. Acceptability, internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, factorial analysis and sensitivity/specificity were calculated. Results: Reliability analyses for sub-scales and threshold scales showed good (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient greater than 0.7) to acceptable (alpha over 0.6) internal consistency. Cronbach’s alpha was over 0.8 when the total scale was considered. Spearman Rank correlations, calculated for 45 pairs of raters on threshold scores, are above 0.66, which is a good sign of accordance between non-specialist raters. Sensitivity and specificity were computed for the number of participants who did and did not cross threshold and for whom a psychiatric disorder was or was not present. The sensitivity was 55% and specificity was 70%. The confirmatory factor analysis with a three-factor solution explained only 46.1%, which suggests a mediocre fit of the data to the model. Even if items have good saturation on each factor, it does not fit with the theoretical model. Conclusions: The validity of the French version in this sample seems to be acceptable. Specificity was higher than those reported in the English version and sensitivity was lower. The French version was less successful in screening than English version, probably because of the low number of false negatives in this sample, which constitutes recruitment bias in a psychiatric sample. Nevertheless, the French version of the PAS-ADD Checklist is reliable as a general screening tool for psychiatric disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Dopamine transporter scans of some patients who have been clinically diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) fail to reveal abnormal dopaminergic functioning and are referred to as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDDs). In this study, we investigated the differences between SWEDDs patients and PD patients using ¹²³I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans. This study enrolled 20 patients with SWEDDs, 30 patients with early PD and 50 healthy controls. Cardiac ¹²³I-MIBG scans were performed on all subjects, and parameters including the early and delayed heart-to-mediastinum ratios (H/M) and the washout rate were compared among the three groups. The mean delayed H/M ratio in the PD group (mean ± standard deviation, 1.45 ± 0.23) was the lowest of the three groups, and the scans in the group without evidence of dopaminergic deficits exhibited a lower mean delayed H/M ratio (2.15 ± 0.48) than the control group (2.56 ± 0.55) (p < 0.05). The intermediate status of cardiac MIBG uptake in the SWEDDs patients in our study may have been due to the heterogeneity of the SWEDDs patients; some of these patients had Parkinsonism with unknown characteristics, some may have had early PD with false-negative dopamine transporter imaging, and some have had primary dystonia that was misdiagnosed as PD. These uncharacterised SWEDDs patients accounted for a larger proportion of the heterogeneous SWEDDs than observed in previous studies, but our results suggest that cardiac ¹²³I-MIBG scans may help to differentiate patients with SWEDDs from patients with PD.

Abstract = {Objective: To develop a computerized adaptive diagnostic screening tool for depression that decreases patient and clinician burden and increases sensitivity and specificity for clinician-based DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: 656 individuals with and without minor and major depression were recruited from a psychiatric clinic and a community mental health center and through public announcements (controls without depression). The focus of the study was the development of the Computerized Adaptive Diagnostic Test for Major Depressive Disorder (CAD-MDD) diagnostic screening tool based on a decision-theoretical approach (random forests and decision trees). The item bank consisted of 88 depression scale items drawn from 73 depression measures. Sensitivity and specificity for predicting clinician-based Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders diagnoses of MDD were the primary outcomes. Diagnostic screening accuracy was then compared to that of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: An average of 4 items per participant was required (maximum of 6 items). Overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 and 0.87, respectively. For the PHQ-9, sensitivity was 0.70 and specificity was 0.91. Conclusions: High sensitivity and reasonable specificity for a clinician-based DSM-IV diagnosis of depression can be obtained using an average of 4 adaptively administered self-report items in less than 1 minute. Relative to the currently used PHQ-9, the CAD-MDD dramatically increased sensitivity while maintaining similar specificity. As such, the CAD-MDD will identify more true positives (lower false-negative rate) than the PHQ-9 using half the number of items. Inexpensive (relative to clinical assessment), efficient, and accurate screening of depression in the settings of primary care, psychiatric epidemiology, molecular genetics, and global health are all direct applications of the current system.

Abstract = {The diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid maltase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type II) in children and adults can be challenging because of the heterogeneous clinical presentation and considerable overlap of signs and symptoms found in other neuromuscular diseases. This review evaluates some of the methods used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease. Muscle biopsy is commonly used as an early diagnostic tool in the evaluation of muscle disease. However, experience has shown that relying solely on visualizing a periodic acid-Schiff-positive vacuolar myopathy to identify late-onset Pompe disease often leads to false-negative results and subsequent delays in identification and treatment of the disorder. Serum creatine kinase level can be normal or only mildly elevated in late-onset Pompe disease and is not very helpful alone to suggest the diagnosis, but in combination with proximal and axial weakness it may raise the suspicion for Pompe disease. A simple blood-based assay to measure the level of α-glucosidase activity is the optimal initial test for confirming or excluding Pompe disease. A timely and accurate diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease likely will improve patient outcomes as care standards including enzyme replacement therapy can be applied and complications can be anticipated. Increased awareness of the clinical phenotype of Pompe disease is therefore warranted to expedite diagnostic screening for this condition with blood-based enzymatic assays.

Abstract = {There is a perceived tradeoff between the ease of measuring alcohol in the body and the accuracy of the result. Direct tests of blood alcohol concentrations are considered the most accurate, desktop stationary breath testers based on electro-chemical infra-red technology are slightly less accurate, but accepted for evidentiary purposes in most jurisdictions, and quick portable breath testers based on fuel-cell technology are the easiest to administer but not acceptable in many courts. This study compared the accuracy of an evidentiary portable breath tester and an evidentiary desktop breath tester relative to blood alcohol concentrations. Inverse regressions were used to obtain confidence limits for the alcohol levels as read by the breath testers that would provide tradeoffs of false positives and false negatives for three levels of confidence: 95%, 96%, and 98%; corresponding to false positive values of 2.5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. A decision tree model is offered for the optimal use of the three measures, so that portable breath testers can be sufficient for high level BrAC, stationary breath testers can be sufficient for medium level BrAC, and blood tests are recommended for still lower BrACs. The model provides quantitative BrAC threshold levels for the two most common BAC levels used to imply DWI: 50 mg/dl and 80 mg/dl. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Children typically follow a well-defined series of stages as they learn to draw, but the rate at which they progress through these stages varies from child to child. Some experts have argued that these individual differences in drawing development reflect individual differences in intelligence. Here we assessed the validity of a drawing test that is commonly used to assess children’s intellectual abilities. In a single study, 125 5- and 6-year-olds completed the Draw-A-Person: A Quantitative Scoring System (DAP:QSS) and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence- Revised (WPPSI-R) or the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Although there was a statistically significant correlation between scores on the DAP:QSS and scores on the Wechsler tests, when the scores of individual children were examined, the DAP:QSS yielded a high number of false positives and false negatives for low intellectual functioning. We conclude that the DAP:QSS is not a valid measure of intellectual ability and should not be used as a screening tool. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Recent (2007–2010) empirical and theoretical literature on associations of trial design features with signal detection and placebo response were investigated, along with data and analytic considerations. Trials with greater percentages of patients randomized to placebo had larger average drug-placebo differences in two comprehensive meta-analyses (MDD and Schizophrenia). Excluding patients with large responses during double-blind placebo lead-ins resulted in small increases in drug-placebo differences. Core factor subscales of the HAMD yielded larger drug-placebo differences than the HAMD total score. Direct likelihood-based (MMRM) and similar analyses provided better control of false positive and false negative results than LOCF and BOCF. Theoretical considerations suggested that the number of sites and number of countries can influence power, depending on the correlation structure in the data and on how sites and countries are chosen. Use of centralized ratings reduced placebo response and improved drug-placebo differences. However, the number of comparisons was too small to draw conclusions. Use of patient ratings and reducing the number of study visits reduced placebo response, but their effects on signal detection were unclear. Practical experience with novel designs such as the sequential parallel approach hold promise for improvements in signal detection. Given the complexities of signal detection and placebo response, no single strategy is likely to fully solve the problem and combinations of approaches may be most useful. Utilizing appropriate analytic techniques and randomizing an adequate fraction of patients to placebo are perhaps the most broadly applicable approaches.

Abstract = {The intelligence community (IC) is asked to predict outcomes that may often be inherently unpredictable—and is blamed for the inevitable forecasting failures, be they false positives or false negatives. To move beyond blame games of accountability ping-pong that incentivize bureaucratic symbolism over substantive reform, it is necessary to reach bipartisan agreements on performance indicators that are transparent enough to reassure clashing elites (to whom the IC must answer) that estimates have not been politicized. Establishing such transideological credibility requires (a) developing accuracy metrics for decoupling probability and value judgments; (b) using the resulting metrics as criterion variables in validity tests of the IC's selection, training, and incentive systems; and (c) institutionalizing adversarial collaborations that conduct level-playing-field tests of clashing perspectives.

Abstract = {This study describes the theoretical and methodological bases of research of psycho-semantic spheres of the psyche of Dari speaking Afghani military personnel. 812 military personnel including 50 intelligence officers were subjected to two types of tests. The first questioner type investigation was the task where the individual was to provide some classification about a topic. The response was a judgment of similarity and/or other association. The second test was a subliminal probing, where the individual had no idea of topics being tested and was acting in a game like environment. The test measured the subject’s response time to words or images (semantic stimuli) targeting the unconscious mind. A non-invasive, non-intrusive unconscious probing provided results which were highly corroborated by eight senior Military Intelligence officers’ ratings. The questioner type test exposed a number of strategies of evading testing procedures overwhelmingly used by tested personnel, even by those who were cleared by subliminal probing and expert opinion. In addition to discussion of the probabilities of false positives and false negative responses; assessment of one’s mental agility or ability to react and learn under stress; general psychological makeup of the population tested is discussed. We established that anyone can take a psycho-semantic unconscious probing test even illiterate people of any race, language or culture. A Semantic Stimuli Response Measurement (SSRM Tek.) test allows for large-scale screening operations to identify unknown threats to national security while serving as a deterrent to undesirable or illegal behaviours and helps to set high standards in personal conduct.

Abstract = {The determination of a cut-off value for a continuous prognostic test is an important problem, which is statistically challenging and practically important for risk assessment. We propose in this paper a method to estimate the optimal cut-off from this type of longitudinal data with censored failure times. The principle is to combine the prognostic error rates of false positives and false negatives with a cost function, which has the advantages to be statistically convenient and to be directly associated with the decision-making. Simulations were performed and the results demonstrate the interest of our approach compared to a reference method. The method is also illustrated by predicting the long-term survival of kidney transplant recipients from the 1-year creatinine clearance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

In this study, we used a new method to decode the affective value of simple actions generated by participants during a standard Go/noGo task. Immediately after each Go/noGo action, participants responded to the valence of either a positive or a negative word. Results showed that False Alarms performed during the Go/noGo task led to a faster evaluative categorization of negative words relative to positive words. This action–word evaluative priming effect occurred when the interval between these two events was set to either 300 or 600 ms, but not 1000 ms. Finally, higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with a reduction of the evaluative priming effect. Our results suggest that simple actions are rapidly evaluated as positive or negative depending on the automatic monitoring of their perceived accuracy.

Abstract = {Background: Traditional Chinese medicine stagnation (“yu”) syndrome is characterized by a cluster of mind/body obstruction-like symptoms. Previous studies have operationalized the concept as a psychological construct through scale development, producing a three-factor 16-item inventory with good psychometric properties. Purpose: The study aimed to further validate the Stagnation Scale by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and examine self-appraisal of stagnation as an illness. Method: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on a random community sample of 755 adults recruited by cluster sampling in Hong Kong. Results: CFA revealed a good fit of the three-factor model (CFI = .95; RMSEA = .077; SRMR = .043). ROC analysis suggested a cutoff score at 50 on stagnation total score for predicting self-appraisal of an illness condition, with false positive and negative rates at 25.8% and 23.3%, respectively. Overall, 6.2% participants self-appraised to suffer stagnation symptoms to a degree of an illness, and for it, 1.9% participants intended to seek treatment. Stagnation showed positive correlations with physical distress, depression, and anxiety (r = .59–.76, p < .01) and negative correlation with age (r =− .22, p < .01). Conclusion: The Stagnation Scale appeared to be robust in factorial and construct validity. With prevalence of illness by self-appraisal at 6.2% and intention for treatment at 1.9%, stagnation is a fairly common condition associated with treatment-seeking behaviors.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of a pupillometer drug screening technology against two conventional measurements, urinalysis and oral swab, in screening probationers that were being monitored by a large urban court. Participants were selected using a simple random sampling method, a probability-type sampling procedure. Simple random samples are groups in which each individual, in this case baselined probationers, have an equal probability of being selected. The breakdown shows that almost 72 percent of the sample was tested. Five of these probationers were unable to be tested with pupillometer technology (PT) at the time of the screening due to eye ailments. The data was described using the cross-tabulation and chi-square methods demonstrating which aspects of the null hypothesis are supported and rejected. Chi-Square was utilized to test for significant relationships between screening instruments and test results. The results suggest that African-Americans and males have a greater propensity for testing positive with PT than their counterparts; however, data which isolates PT false-positives and false-negatives show that these groups comprised the largest percentage for both error types. Therefore, differences in the distribution of test responses are likely to be based on the proportion of specific groups within the population.

Abstract = {Readers typically respond with anger and derogation when they discover that an author has engaged in intentional deception (representing a false story as true). Does this negative response to the author also cause individuals to correct beliefs that may have been changed by the discredited story? In this experiment (N = 160), the alleged truth status of a narrative was manipulated. In one condition, the narrative was presented as fictional (a socially accepted form of untruth). The remaining three conditions initially presented the story as factual. Participants in two of these conditions were informed after reading the story that it was inaccurate due to a) accidental error or b) intentional deception. The story changed attitudes from a no-story control in all conditions. Although readers derogated a deceptive author, they did not correct their attitudes even in the intentional and accidental error conditions. A measure of the parts of the story that the participants rejected (false note circling), suggests that participants were motivated to correct for inaccuracies, but were not able to do so effectively.

Abstract = {Objective: Depression is a very common disorder in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Evaluating depression in patients with ACS in clinical settings is complicated by the lack of uniform criteria in choosing the appropriate instruments and the appropriate time of assessment of depressive symptoms. The aim of this review is to examine the performance of the instruments utilized to assess depression in patients with an ACS in a primary care setting. Methods: We identified studies published between 1990 and 2010 that used standardized validated questionnaires to assess depression. Results: Of the studies reviewed, 85% assessed depression within a week of hospitalization for ACS. Sensitivity ranged from 75% in the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale to 88% in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Specificity ranged from 62% for the Geriatric Depression Scale to 88% for the PHQ-9. Conclusions: This review suggests that the PHQ-9 is the most effective instrument for primary care settings due to its high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (89%). In a screening process, a scale with high sensitivity but low specificity will yield more false positives, whereas a scale with low sensitivity high specificity will yield a higher number of false negatives. In the case of choosing a screening tool to assess depression in patients with ACS, advantages and disadvantages should be considered, especially the trade-off between sensitivity (true positives) and specificity (false positives).

Abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study was to propose diagnostic norms for the rapid neuropsychological battery, in the detection of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Population and methods: Three hundred and fifty-two control subjects (mean MMSE : 27.3±2.5) and 676 patients with Alzheimer's disease (mean MMSE : 22.9±2.6) at a mild stage (CDR=1) were selected according to age (60–69, 70–79 and 80–89 years) and educational level (French primary Education Certificate or lower versus Certificate of Professional Aptitude or the School Leaving Certificate versus the Baccalaureate or higher). Age and education-adjusted cut-off scores were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves so as to determine the discriminative ability (sensitivity, specificity) of each test from the RAPID neuropsychological battery. Cut-off scores with a specificity set at least at 90% were also proposed. Results: The Free and Cued Recall Test exhibited good sensitivity (from 87% to 100% for free recall and from 85% to 98% for total recall) and specificity (from 85% to 96% for free recall and from 86% to 100% for total recall). For the other tests, sensitivities and specificities were lower. Conclusion: The use of these two types of cut-off scores should help the clinician in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by limiting the risk of false positives and false negatives. The choice of the cut-off scores will depend on the patient's individual clinical context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The effect of self-relevance of a non-critical item in the Concealed Information Test (CIT) was investigated. Respiration, skin conductance response (SCR), heart rate, and normalized pulse volume were recorded while performing the CIT using a stimulus set composed of 4 items (with one self-relevant item). Thirty participants were instructed to recognize one item as critical and the remaining items as non-critical (positive group), and 33 participants were instructed to recognize all items as non-critical (negative group). In the positive group, a differential reactivity was observed between the critical and non-critical items, despite the self-relevance of the non-critical item. In the negative group, a differential reactivity between the self-relevant and non-self-relevant items was observed for SCR only. However, when individual data were analyzed, there was a differential reactivity between self-relevant and non-self-relevant items on physiological measures other than SCR for some participants in the negative group. These results suggest that the self-relevance of a non-critical item might cause false positive results in "negative" participants, particularly when only SCR is used to assess differential reactivity.

Abstract = {Aim: The Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS) was developed to assess the social impairment caused by depression. The purposes of this study were to develop a Japanese version of the SASS (SASS-J) and to evaluate its reliability and validity. Methods: The SASS-J and the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered to 322 participants (95 working patients who were working while under treatment for depression, 99 non-working patients who were absent from their work due to depression, and 128 healthy controls). The healthy controls underwent both questionnaires twice, at baseline and 2 weeks later, in order to assess test–retest reliability. Results: Cronbach’s alpha was 0.81. Significance correlations were found between SASS-J scores at baseline and 2 weeks later in healthy controls (R = 0.845, P < 0.001). There were negative correlations between the SASS-J and BDI scores (ρ = −0.683, P < 0.001). Mean SASS-J scores differed significantly among the three groups (working patients: 33.7 ± 7.9; non-working patients: 25.2 ± 7.8; healthy controls: 36.1 ± 6.0 [mean ± SD]). The best compromise between the true positive and the false negative rate in this study was at a cut-off point of 25/26. Conclusion: SASS-J showed sufficient reliability and validity, and could be considered a suitable instrument to evaluate social functioning in depressive patients.

Abstract = {This paper presents a Fuzzy approach to health-monitoring of patients in pervasive computing environments. A decision model considers three classes of variables that represent the context information being collected: environmental, physiological, and behavioral. A case study of blood pressure monitoring was developed to identify critical situations based on medical knowledge. The solution maintains the interpretability of the decision rules, even after a learning phase which may propose adjustments in these rules. In this phase, the Fuzzy c-Means clustering was chosen to adjust membership functions, using the cluster centers. A medical team evaluated data from 24-h monitoring of 30 patients and the rating was compared with the results of the system. The proposed approach proved to be individualized, identifying critical events in patients with different levels of blood pressure with an accuracy of 90% and low number of false negatives.

Abstract = {Background: Sizing of GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions within the C9ORF72 locus, which account for approximately 10% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, is urgently required to answer fundamental questions about mechanisms of pathogenesis in this important genetic variant. Currently employed PCR protocols are limited to discrimination between the presence and absence of a modified allele with more than 30 copies of the repeat, while Southern hybridisation-based methods are confounded by the somatic heterogeneity commonly present in blood samples, which might cause false-negative or ambiguous results. Results: We describe an optimised Southern hybridisation-based protocol that allows confident detection of the presence of a C9ORF72 repeat expansion alongside independent assessment of its heterogeneity and the number of repeat units. The protocol can be used with either a radiolabeled or non-radiolabeled probe. Using this method we have successfully sized the C9ORF72 repeat expansion in lymphoblastoid cells, peripheral blood, and post-mortem central nervous system (CNS) tissue from ALS patients. It was also possible to confidently demonstrate the presence of repeat expansion, although of different magnitude, in both C9ORF72 alleles of the genome of one patient. Conclusions: The suggested protocol has sufficient advantages to warrant adoption as a standard for Southern blot hybridisation analysis of GGGGCC repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 locus.

Abstract = {Objectives: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) failed to detect any genetic associations with susceptibility to vascular dementia (VaD) by the Bonferroni multiple test. This study aimed to discover false negative associations from the GWAS. Methods: We selected a candidate gene in which multiple associations were identified with its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic associations were intensively examined with its SNPs using 207 VaD patients and 207 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Functions of candidate SNPs on splicing of the gene were predicted by an in silico analysis and evaluated by a minigene assay. Results: Genetic analysis with 80 SNPs of pleckstrin homology like domain beta 2 (PHLDB2) revealed 6 SNPs associated with VaD (P < 6.25 × 10−4). Among them, four SNPs in introns 2 and 3 were in complete linkage and associated also with VaD-related phenotypes (P < 0.05). Especially, rs951660 was predicted to produce splicing enhancers or serine/arginine-rich protein binding sites, and its minor allele (A) delayed expression of mRNA in vivo. Conclusions: The current study suggested a novel association of susceptibility to VaD with the gene encoding PHLDB2. The minor allele, A, of its intronic SNP ‘ rs951660 ’ might induce a delayed splicing and thus increase the susceptibility to VaD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aim: The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive part (ADAS-Cog) for the evaluation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or very mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods: The discriminative abilities of RBMT and ADAS-Cog were compared in the very early stage of AD or MCI patients. Furthermore, we evaluated the difference in both RBMT score and ADAS-Cog score between different severities. Results: Evident superiority in the false negative rate was observed in RBMT over ADAS-Cog in MCI or very mild AD. In addition, 86.7% of the subjects overlooked by ADAS-Cog were correctly detected by RBMT profile score. However, the RBMT score falls in the very early stages and the range of the RBMT score is rather narrow. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate status and follow the progression in severer cases. In contrast to RBMT, the ADAS-Cog score has a wide range and can evaluate and follow the severity in more severe cases. Conclusion: RBMT is more useful than ADAS-Cog in evaluating patients with MCI or very mild AD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This article addresses likely error rates for measuring teacher and school performance in the upper elementary grades using value-added models applied to student test score gain data. Using a realistic performance measurement system scheme based on hypothesis testing, the authors develop error rate formulas based on ordinary least squares and Empirical Bayes estimators. Empirical results suggest that value-added estimates are likely to be noisy using the amount of data that are typically used in practice. Type I and II error rates for comparing a teacher’s performance to the average are likely to be about 25% with 3 years of data and 35% with 1 year of data. Corresponding error rates for overall false positive and negative errors are 10% and 20%, respectively. Lower error rates can be achieved if schools are the performance unit. The results suggest that policymakers must carefully consider likely system error rates when using value-added estimates to make high-stakes decisions regarding educators.

Abstract = {Two studies investigated people's motivations for testing, and the influence of awareness of test inaccuracies, on their intentions to undergo cancer screening tests. Study 1 used a between‐subjects design in which participants stated their intentions regarding one of several screening tests with equal accuracy but with either false negative, false positive, or unspecified errors. Study 2 used a within‐subjects design in which participants indicated their intentions regarding each of those screening tests. In Study 1, intentions for testing were relatively high, affected by instrumental (illness prevention) motivations, and unaffected by type of error acknowledged. Individuals with higher emotional (reassurance seeking) motivations had lower intentions to uptake tests with false positive errors. In Study 2, intentions to uptake all tests were lower compared to Study 1, and were affected by emotional motivations. Participants preferred a test with unspecified errors over tests with specified errors, and, when forced to choose, preferred tests with false negative over false positive errors. Findings are discussed in relation to Error Management Theory and Self‐Regulation Theory, emphasising the need to recognise motivations, affect, and framing as important factors in informed screening decisions.

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the false positive rate and false negative rate of the Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the related factors in the epidemiological survey of mental illnesses in Zhejiang Province. Method: A total of 15000 subjects were randomly selected from the province-wide using multi-stage stratified cluster randomization. Analyses for this paper were made in the quality control sample, 10% of the total 15000 subjects (1510 subjects), in which the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) was used as a golden criterion, and a cutoff score of the GHQ-12 was set to 3 to define GHQ-12 cases. Results: Totally 1449 subjects (96.0%) completed both the GHQ-12 and the SCID. Adjusted for sampling effects, the false positive and negative rates of the GHQ-12 were respective 14.6% and 7.8%. Adjusted for other considered correlates and sampling effects, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of GHQ-12 false positive with living in less economically developed urban areas (urban type II) , with self-reportedly poor physical health, with having ever sought help because of mental problems and with being currently married/co-habited were respective 2.23 (95% CI; 1.24-4.01), 2.36 (1.36-4.10), 1.53 (1.10-2.14) and 0.51 (0.30-0.86) while AORs of GHQ-12 false negative with being aged 35-49 year group and living in less economically developed rural areas (rural type II) were respective 2.59(1.18-5.67) and 2.72(1.21-6.14). Conclusion: Factors related to the GHQ-12 false positive and negative are different. The cutoff scores of the GHQ-12 should be used based on the characteristics of subjects during identifying or screening mental illnesses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The delineation of schizophrenia-related symptomatology is critical to informative clinical phenotyping in linkage studies. A minority of first-degree relatives of schizophrenia and schizoaffective probands (RelSZSA) qualifies for a clinical diagnosis in the schizophrenia spectrum. Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is a key component of this spectrum, largely because of its relatively specific familial aggregation in relatives. The criteria for SPD were not developed for the purpose of identifying RelSZSA, however, and SPD is not a homogeneous clinical disorder, potentially introducing false positives and false negatives into affectedness classifications. In this study we used logistic regression (LR) to identify the combination of clinical signs and symptoms that maximized the discrimination between nonpsychotic first-degree RelSZSA (n = 241) and controls (n = 161). Three variables contributed significantly to optimizing this distinction: no close friends or confidants other than family members, social isolation and irritability. The combination of deviant LR scores and schizophrenia-spectrum psychotic disorders had greater sensitivity for identifying RelSZSA, 23.7%, than SPD and schizophrenia-spectrum psychotic disorders, 16%. Importantly, the diagnosis of SPD and deviant LR scores were not significantly correlated. Most individuals with deviant LR scores did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of SPD and only a minority of those who were diagnosed with SPD had deviant LR scores. Since misclassification of gene carriers as non-gene carriers in linkage analyses increases the risk of false negatives, it may be advantageous to tailor the definition of the clinical phenotype to those aspects of social–interpersonal dysfunction that optimize the discrimination of RelSZSA from controls.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by D. J. Baumgardner et al. (see record [rid]2011-01914-001[/rid]). The regional study by Baumgardner and colleagues converges with existing literature to clearly show that the distribution of ADHD diagnosis falls along socioeconomic lines, according to the relative wealth of neighborhoods. This adds additional evidence that trends in the diagnosis and treatment for ADHD in children move in the exact opposite direction from those who are at highest risk for meeting criteria, for experiencing impairment, for and downstream socioeconomic sequelae. Contributing factors, such as marginal diagnoses (such as when parent and teacher symptom reports diverge), inadequate insurance coverage, limited time, and lack of familiarity and comfort with diagnostic and prescribing guidelines, may leave the door open to misdiagnosis and treatment. In some cases, this may take the form of over-diagnosis and over-treatment, in the form of false-positive diagnoses with ADHD, and treatments for it, or may alternatively take the form of false-negative diagnoses. If the social and epidemiological data are any indication, it is furthermore likely that such false-positive or false-negative outcomes may break along socioeconomic lines. Increased use of formal screening tools, increased curricular time for mental health in primary care residencies, support for physicians in the field in the form of referral options and remote consultation and support, may all serve to improve quality of care for individual patients, and may also serve to regularize treatment across socioeconomic and sociodemographic lines, hence reducing disparities. Further research is needed to study the root causes and dynamics that create such disparities, but the steps outlined above may help in the near term.

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if these two commonly-administered isometric tests are accurate indices of effort. Participants: 34 healthy subjects were tested once giving a maximum voluntary effort and once attempting to feign weakness of 50% of maximum. Results: During feigned weakness sessions, 20 of 34 subjects (58.5%), produced CVs of 15% or less during the Leg Lift. At the 95% CI, the expected frequency of false negatives for feigned weakness is 42.3 to 75.3% for the Leg Lift. At the 95% CI, the expected frequency of false negatives for feigned weakness is 51.9% to 83.3% for the Arm Lift. Conclusions: Neither isometric lift is appropriate for classifying validity of effort. Use of these isometric lifts should be discontinued for the assessment of effort.

Abstract = {Across five experiments we examined the role of valence in children's and adults' true and false memories. Using the Deese/Roediger-McDermott paradigm and either neutral or negative-emotional lists, both adults' (Experiment 1) and children's (Experiment 2) true recall and recognition was better for neutral than negative items, and although false recall was also higher for neutral items, false recognition was higher for negative items. The last three experiments examined adults' (Experiment 3) and children's (Experiments 4 and 5) 1-week long-term recognition of neutral and negative-emotional information. The results replicated the immediate recall and recognition findings from the first two experiments. More important, these experiments showed that although true recognition decreased over the 1-week interval, false recognition of neutral items remained unchanged whereas false recognition of negative-emotional items increased. These findings are discussed in terms of theories of emotion and memory as well as their forensic implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Deployed military women have an increased risk for development of vaginitis due to extreme temperatures, primitive sanitation, hygiene and laundry facilities, and unavailable or unacceptable healthcare resources. The Women in the Military Self-Diagnosis (WMSD) and treatment kit was developed as a field-expedient solution to this problem. Objectives: The primary study aims were to evaluate the accuracy of women’s self-diagnosis of vaginal symptoms and eight diagnostic algorithms and to predict potential selfmedication omission and commission error rates. Method: Participants included 546 active duty, deployable Army (43.3%) and Navy (53.6%) women with vaginal symptoms who sought healthcare at troop medical clinics on base. In the clinic lavatory, women conducted a self-diagnosis using a sterile cotton swab to obtain vaginal fluid, a FemExam® card to measure positive or negative pH and amines, and the investigator-developed WMSD Decision- Making Guide©. Potential self-diagnoses were "bacterial infection" (bacterial vaginosis [BV] and/or trichomonas vaginitis [TV]), "yeast infection" (candida vaginitis [CV]), "no infection/normal," or "unclear." The Affirm VPIII® laboratory reference standard was used to detect clinically significant amounts of vaginal fluid DNA for organisms associated with BV, TV, and CV. Results: Women’s self-diagnostic accuracy was 56% for BV/ TV and 69.2% for CV. False-positives would have led to a self-medication commission error rate of 20.3% for BV/TV and 8% for CV. Potential self-medication omission error rates due to false-negatives were 23.7% for BV/TV and 24.8% for CV. The positive predictive value of diagnostic algorithms ranged from 0% to 78.1% for BV/TV and 41.7% for CV. Discussion: The algorithms were based on clinical diagnostic standards. The nonspecific nature of vaginal symptoms, mixed infections, and a faulty device intended to measure vaginal pH and amines explain why none of the algorithms reached the goal of 95% accuracy. The next prototype of the WMSD kit will not include nonspecific vaginal signs and symptoms in favor of recently available point-of-care devices that identify antigens or enzymes of the causative BV, TV, and CV organisms.

Abstract = {Background: In this study we wished to determine the diagnostic accuracy of unaided general practitioners' (GPs') clinical diagnosis in the evaluation of depression in depressed patients under their care compared with the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Subjects and methods: From 17,000 patients in 10 GPs' offices as representative sample in the city of Zagreb, 5100 patients from three GPs' offices were selected. The sample consisted of 53 out of 76 depressed patients with a diagnosis of Depressive episode (F32) or Recurrent depressive disorder (F33) classified according to ICD-10 and assessed by review of the GP's standardized medical records. Cross-sectional investigation was performed during February 2008. GPs classified depressed patients as either nondepressed without therapy, nondepressed with therapy or depressed with therapy. Within a two-week period, the unaided GPs' diagnosis was compared with BDI-II performed by psychologists unfamiliar with the GPs' assessment. Based on the GP vs. BDI-II comparison, patients were classified as either positive, false positive, false negative or negative. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV associated with physician identification of depression were calculated by standard methods. Results Depressiveness was found by BD-II in the group 'depressed with therapy' (24.39±10.91). ANOVA found a significant difference in BDI-II means between the outcome groups (P<0.001). Scheffe's procedure found a significant difference in BDI-II in patients with therapy (nondepressed vs. depressed) (P<0.001) and nondepressed without therapy vs. depressed with therapy (P<0.001). There were 16 depressed patients, 27 nondepressed, 2 false positive, and 8 false negative. Unaided GPs' clinical diagnosis showed 66% sensitivity, 93%, specificity, 88% PPV, and 77% NPV. Conclusion: Unaided GPs' clinical diagnosis with 88% PPV outperforms other measures of patient depression and is easier to implement when compared to the psychiatric model of caseness, which is based on screening instruments.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Jan B. Pietzsch et al. (see record [rid]2011-16231-005[/rid]), who evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three commonly used diagnostic strategies (full-night polysomnography [PSG], split-night PSG, unattended portable home-monitoring) in conjunction with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The current authors state that Pietzsch et al. should be congratulated for doing a comprehensive Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness ratio of different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However underlying assumptions may have inflated the impact of false negative and false positive test results. Pietzsch et al. assumed that OSA treatment would dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, that patients incorrectly diagnosed with OSA by a home study would use continuous CPAP long term with a compliance similar to that of patients with OSA, and that 22% of patients with a technical failure or a negative ambulatory study would not return for a follow-up PSG. In the end, the fundamental issue is not whether ambulatory studies are better or worse than PSG, but rather under what conditions use of home studies are appropriate.

Abstract = {Background: There is uncertainty regarding how well clinical nurse specialists are able to identify distress in cancer settings. Methods: We examined recognition of patient-reported distress by nurse specialists across three sites in the East Midlands (UK). Clinicians were asked to report on their clinical opinion regarding the presence of distress or any mental health complication after routine assessment of 401 mixed cancer patients. Patient-reported distress was defined by the distress thermometer at a cut-off of 4 or higher. Results: We found that the prevalence of patient-reported distress was 45.4%. The rates for mild, moderate and severe distress were: 23.4, 13.7 and 8.2, respectively. When looking for distress (or any mental health complication) nurse practitioners had a detection sensitivity of 50.5% and specificity 80.0%. Cohen’s kappa suggested fair agreement between staff and patients. Examining predictors of distress, clinicians were better able to recognise higher severities of distress (adjusted R² = .87 P = 0.001). There was lower sensitivity in palliative stages but no differences according to the type of cancer. There was also higher sensitivity but lower specificity in those clinicians with high self-rated confidence. Conclusions: Nurses working in cancer settings have difficulty identifying distress using their routine clinical judgement and tend to make more false-negative than false-positive errors. Evidence-based strategies that improve detection of mild and moderate distress are required in routine cancer care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This paper considers the proposed revisions to the DSM revision 5. The article discusses the process of classification in general and its application to the DSM. The argument in part is that classification schemes are judged by their usefulness in advancing social practices. The DSM serves a number of different such practices—most obviously research and treatment—and these may make different demands on any scheme. The paper goes on to consider the ethical issues involved in classifying mental disorders and in changing existing classifications. A preliminary scheme of ethical issues in relation to false negatives, false positives and social issues is offered. Finally, the paper considers the wider implications of the proposed changes to the classification of personality disorders and whether these changes may have a ripple effect on our understanding of ourselves and others.

Abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the occurrence of symptomatic and asymptomatic root compression caused by herniated discs and spondylotic foraminal stenosis by MRI in patients with recent onset cervical radiculopathy. Participants: 78 patients with symptoms and signs of cervical radiculopathy of less than one month's duration. Methods: The authors determined the clinically suspected level of root compression in each patient. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated MRIs, blinded for the clinical findings. For each patient, the level of root compression on MRI was compared with the clinically affected level. The authors also examined the cause of compression: herniated disc, spondylotic foraminal stenosis or both. Results: In 73% of patients, the clinically affected root was compressed on MRI. In 45%, MRI showed root compression without clinical substrate together with, or to a lesser extent without, the coexistence of compression of the clinically affected root. MRIs were assessed as normal in 13–15% of cases, and in 9–10% only asymptomatic roots were compressed. Herniated discs without spondylosis were more often responsible for root compressions only at the clinically affected level and spondylotic foraminal stenosis for multiple root compression including compression of clinically unaffected roots. Conclusion: MRI findings in patients with cervical radiculopathy should be interpreted together with the clinical findings, as false-positive and false-negative MRIs occur rather frequently.

Abstract = {With hippocampal atrophy both a clinical biomarker for early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and implicated in many other neurological and psychiatric diseases, there is much interest in the accurate, reproducible delineation of this region of interest (ROI) in structural MR images. Here we present Fast Marching for Automated Segmentation of the Hippocampus (FMASH): a novel approach using the Sethian Fast Marching (FM) technique to grow a hippocampal ROI from an automatically-defined seed point. Segmentation performance is assessed on two separate clinical datasets, utilising expert manual labels as gold standard to quantify Dice coefficients, false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). The first clinical dataset (denoted CMA) contains normal controls (NC) and atrophied AD patients, whilst the second is a collection of NC and bipolar (BP) patients (denoted BPSA). An optimal and robust stopping criterion is established for the propagating FM front and the final FMASH segmentation estimates compared to two commonly-used methods: FIRST/FSL and Freesurfer (FS). Results show that FMASH outperforms both FIRST and FS on the BPSA data, with significantly higher Dice coefficients (0.80 ± 0.01) and lower FPR. Despite some intrinsic bias for FIRST and FS on the CMA data, due to their training, FMASH performs comparably well on the CMA data, with an average bilateral Dice coefficient of 0.82 ± 0.01. Furthermore, FMASH most accurately captures the hippocampal volume difference between NC and AD, and provides a more accurate estimation of the problematic hippocampus–amygdala border on both clinical datasets. The consistency in performance across the two datasets suggests that FMASH is applicable to a range of clinical data with differing image quality and demographics.

Abstract = {Objectives: Evaluators examining the same evidence often arrive at substantially different conclusions in forensic assessments of child sexual abuse (CSA). This study attempts to identify and quantify subjective factors that contribute to such disagreements so that interventions can be devised to improve the reliability of case decisions. Methods: Participants included 1106 professionals in the field of child maltreatment representing a range of professional positions or job titles and years of experience. Each completed the Child Forensic Attitude Scale (CFAS), a 28-item survey assessing 3 forensic attitudes believed to influence professional judgments about CSA allegations: emphasis-on-sensitivity (i.e., a focus on minimizing false negatives or errors of undercalling abuse); emphasis-on-specificity (i.e., a focus on minimizing false positives or errors of overcalling abuse); and skepticism toward child and adolescent reports of CSA. A subset of 605 professionals also participated in 1 of 3 diverse decision exercises to assess the influence of the 3 forensic attitudes on ratings of case credibility. Results: Exploratory factor analysis identified 4 factors or attitude subscales that corresponded closely with the original CFAS scales: 2 subscales for emphasis-on-sensitivity and 1 each for emphasis-on-specificity and skepticism. Attitude subscale scores differed significantly by sample source (in-state trainings vs. national conferences), gender, years of experience, and professional position, with Child Protective Service workers unexpectedly more concerned about overcalling abuse and more skeptical of child disclosures than other professionals—a pattern of scores associated with an increased probability of disbelieving CSA allegations. The 3 decision exercises offered validation of the attitude subscales as predictors of professional ratings of case credibility, with adjusted R2s for the three exercises ranging from .06 to .24, suggesting highly variable effect sizes. Conclusions: Evaluator disagreements about CSA allegations can be explained, in part, by individual differences in 3 attitudes related to forensic decision-making: emphasis-on-sensitivity, emphasis-on-specificity, and skepticism toward child reports of abuse. These attitudes operate as predispositions or biases toward viewing CSA allegations as likely true or likely false. Several strategies for curbing the influence of subjective factors are highlighted including self-awareness of personal biases and team approaches to assessment.

In study 2, we evaluated the extent to which interval methods that were sensitive to changes in study 1 produced false positives. In part, the results show that momentary time sampling with interval sizes up to 30 s detected a wide range of changes in duration events and frequency events during lengthier observation periods.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in firefighters. Methods: Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat percentage (BF%) were assessed in 478 career and 199 volunteer male firefighters from randomly selected departments. Results: High prevalence rates of overweight + obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) were found in career (79.5%; 33.5%) and volunteer firefighters (78.4%; 43.2%). False-positive obesity misclassification based on BMI, compared to waist circumference and BF%, was low (9.8% and 2.9%, respectively). False negatives were much higher: 32.9% and 13.0%. Obese firefighters demonstrated unfavorable cardiovascular disease (CVD) profiles. Conclusions: The prevalence of overweight and obesity exceeded that of the US general population. Contrary to common wisdom, obesity was even more prevalent when assessed by BF% than by BMI, and misclassifying muscular firefighters as obese by using BMI occurred infrequently.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by J. Phelps and S. N. Ghaemi (see record [rid]2012-30246-002[/rid]). Phelps and Ghaemi's article highlighted the necessity of 'good' clinical practice. Their article provided a succinct review of some the concepts underlying manualized diagnostic criteria and their statistical relationship to low prevalence disorders, specifically bipolar disorder. Whether or not you concede with their conclusion that bipolar disorder is not overdiagnosed as commonly claimed, their article highlights the necessity for pragmatic and often neglected steps in the diagnostic encounter. Specifically, Phelps and Ghaemi advocate for the necessity of taking a comprehensive history coupled with clinicians having a thorough understanding of factors associated with the different mental disorders. Although this notion may seem somewhat simplistic as well as being key components of 'good' clinical practice, the necessity of such endeavors seem to have been overlooked in favor of a predominant focus upon the diagnostic criteria. Rather, the 'reworking' of the diagnostic criteria either through tightening to minimize false positives or through loosening to minimize false negatives has taken favor. Further changes to the diagnostic criteria can also bring with them unintended consequences such as a significant rise in the diagnosis of some disorders. Thus, highlighting the efficacy of Phelps and Ghaemi's assertion that moderate diagnostic criteria, coupled with a comprehensive history and a clinically relevant knowledge of factors associated with the different mental disorders, is the most effective mode through which both false positives and false negatives can be minimized. Hence, although Phelps and Ghaemi's recommendations may seem simplistic if they were followed, both false positive and false negative diagnoses could be minimized. Their recommendations are in accordance with best practice highlighting the crucial need to focus upon understanding the patient in the context of his or her presentation. Further, such an approach could also assist with overcoming the prognostic pessimism inherent in some of the DSM classifications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy and reliability of the computed tomographic (CT) diagnosis of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to evaluate the inter-observer variation of CT reports of acute TBI between two experienced neuroradiologists and a neuroradiologist in training. One hundred cranial CT examinations of suspected TBI were chosen randomly from those taken during 1 year at a university central hospital, with institutional ethics committee approval. Two neuroradiologists and one neuroradiologist in training read the scans independently and were blinded to the clinical data. The original reports of radiologists on call, who were either radiology residents or general radiologists, were reviewed. Main outcome measures were false-positive and false-negative findings, and the congruency of different readers’ reports. The reference standard was a group consensus formed by three neuroradiologists. Radiologists on call missed a significant number of brain contusions (67%), but with regard to intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhages and edema, their accuracy was moderate. They reported practically no false-positive brain contusion findings, and all readers found subdural hemorrhages reliably. The two experienced neuroradiologists had the smallest number of false-negative findings, but their reports differed significantly. Of the other neuroradiologists’ mistakes, 75% were false-positive, nearly all of these concerning contusions, whereas the other made random mistakes. In conclusion, there was a marked variation between readers in the detection of brain contusion findings on acute brain CT. Experience increased accuracy, yet even between the reports of the most experienced readers, there were marked differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study investigated the psychometric properties of the kindergarten Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI; Texas Education Agency and the University of Texas System, 2004–2006) Mid-Year screeners with a sample of 180 students. The TPRI screeners were designed to determine which students are not at risk for later reading failure. Results indicated adequate internal consistency reliability and concurrent and predictive validity for screening purposes. Classification validity analyses indicated low false negative rates and high negative predictive power but substantial false positive rates and low positive predictive power. The TPRI Mid-Year screeners were found to be adequate instruments for identifying students who are unlikely in need of further assessment. Recommendations are provided for using the TPRI within a response-to-intervention or other prevention-based service delivery model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {There is ongoing debate regarding the epidemiology of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in military personnel. Accurate and timely estimates of the incidence of brain injury and the prevalence of long-term problems associated with brain injuries among active duty service members and veterans are essential for (a) operational planning, and (b) to allocate sufficient resources for rehabilitation and ongoing services and supports. The purpose of this article is to discuss challenges associated with post-deployment screening for MTBI. Multiple screening methods have been used in military, Veterans Affairs, and independent studies, which complicate cross-study comparisons of the resulting epidemiological data. We believe that post-deployment screening is important and necessary—but no screening methodology will be flawless, and false positives and false negatives are inevitable. Additional research is necessary to refine the sequential screening methodology, with the goal of minimizing false negatives during initial post-deployment screening and minimizing false positives during follow-up evaluations.

Abstract = {Aims: To examine the correlation of S-100B to cranial computerized tomography (CCT) scan results in children after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Methods: One hundred and nine paediatric patients (0-18 years) with MTBI were included in this prospective single-centre study. Serum was collected within 6 h of trauma for determination of serum S-100B. The upper reference of S-100B was set to 0.16 μg/L. A CCT scan was performed in all patients and the results were correlated to the S-100B values. Results: Computerized tomography was abnormal in 36 patients showing intracerebral haemorrhages and/or skull fractures. Serum S-100B level was significantly higher in patients with a pathological condition as shown in CT scan results (p = 0.003). There were no false negative, but 42 false positive test results for S-100B. This resulted in a sensitivity of 1.00, specificity of 0.42, positive predictive value of 0.46 and negative predictive value of 1.00. An area under the receiver operating curve of 0.68 was calculated. Conclusion: S-100B is a valuable tool to rule out patients with pathological CCT findings in a collective of paediatric patients with MTBI. Elevations of S-100B do not necessarily lead to a pathological finding in the CT scan, but values below the cut-off safely rule out the evidence of intracranial lesions.

Abstract = {The use of survey data can be significantly hampered by the occurrence of measurement error, particularly that engendered by respondent misreporting. Previous studies have shown that public program participation tends to be substantially misreported and underestimated. Comparison with administrative records shows such a situation with the reporting of Medicaid enrollment in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS); for 36.2 percent of enrollees, their coverage was not reported in the survey. While false positive reporting also occurs, it is, on a percentage basis, much less frequent. To understand and correct for the false negative reporting, and to develop improvements to surveys to mitigate the occurrence of misreporting, it is useful to understand the factors that relate to it. This research sought to establish the relationship between false negative Medicaid reporting and various factors associated with the coverage (such as recency and intensity), the enrollee (such as demographics and the use of services), and differences in coverage status between the respondent and the person for whom he or she was reporting. Results show that coverage patterns including shared coverage, recency, and intensity of coverage all strongly relate to false negative Medicaid reporting in the CPS. The findings provide important guidance for questionnaire design improvements as well as model-based adjustments to the survey data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aims: The purpose of this literature review was to explore how women attending a national mammography screening programme reacted to the screening process on quality of life (QoL). The research question was what implications regarding true-negative results and false-positive results from mammography screening were found among women? Quality of life including life domains as psychological, physical and social was the theoretical reference in the study. Method: Guided by the concept of QoL on mammography screening a database search of Medline, Cinahl and Cochrane was carried out. Search terms such as QoL, anxiety and mammography have been used. Findings: A review of studies between 1995 and 2007 showed that the implications regarding a negative result were less than those regarding false-positive one. It was found that women with negative results after mammography screening experience minor negative psychological consequences, and some women have even measured less anxiety following mammography than before because of the reassurance given by a clear negative result. False-positive result and recalls were a problem for many women. The process following recalls do affect women emotionally, decrease their wellbeing and QoL for weeks and even months. Conclusion: Future research should be directed at measuring the short-term outcomes in representative populations for whom screening and prevention are indicated. This knowledge would be useful for the organisation of the mammography programmes and for communication with the general population, the women coming for screening and those who do not attend.

Abstract = {Acute otitis media (AOM) is a leading cause of family medicine consultations. Rates of AOM are traditionally determined by review of medical charts, which can be costly and time consuming. This information can also be obtained directly from patients (or parents) by self-administered surveys or personal interview. To ensure the quality of self-reported AOM as a proxy for physician-recorded diagnosis, we assessed its accuracy compared to medical report documentation. Self (and maternal) reports of AOM at outpatient consultations at family practice clinics and hospital emergency departments were collected prospectively by interview from participants in the Hutterite Influenza Prevention Study. Similar data were also collected by fax requests for medical record information to the medical facilities. We calculated AOM reporting by each data source. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of self-reported AOM using medical record documentation as the gold standard were determined. Compared to the medical records, the proportion of AOM cases was underestimated by participants (22% versus 16%), but this difference was not significant (p = 07). Self-report of AOM was a very specific measure (93%), but had lower sensitivity (47%) than medical records. Positive predictive value was moderate at 64% but negative predictive value was good at 86%. The positive likelihood ratio was 6.7, while the negative likelihood ratio was 0.57. Self-report of AOM in our sample had high specificity and good negative predictive value. However, reliance on self-report without verification by medical record may result in a number of false negatives, which may affect enrolment eligibility or outcome analyses in medical research.

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Social Communication Scale (SCO). Method: Throughout 2010-2011, we evaluated children who were between 18-60 months of age in the outpatient clinic who were diagnosed as having autism (n=49) or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n:=18) according to the DMS-IV criteria. The control group consisted of 51 children with developmental delay (25 mental retardation, 26 speech delay) and 71 children with typical development in the same age group. We used a one way analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey HSD test to compare the SCO scores of the groups. For the reliability and validity analysis the Cronbach alpha, item-total score correlations and test-retest correlations were used. Principal components analysis and varimax rotation were used to find the factor solutions. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were utilised to detect cut-off scores, sensitivity, specificity,and negative and positive predictive values. Results: The analysis yielded 3 factors named Language, Reciprocal Social Interaction and Stereotypic Behaviors/ Restricted Areas of Interest. The Cronbach alpha value of the total score was 0.88. The test-retest correlation was high (r=0.90, p<0.01). The SCO Total, Language, Reciprocal Social Interaction and Stereotypic Behaviors/Restricted Areas of Interest scores were significantly different among the groups. The SCO Total, Reciprocal Social Interaction and Stereotypic Behaviors/Restricted Areas of Interest scores were highest in the autism spectrum disorders group. The SCO Language and Stereotypic Behaviors/Restricted Areas of Interest scores were not significantly different between the developmental delay and the typical development groups. ROC analysis indicated that the SCO Total and Reciprocal Social Interaction scores differentiated very well between the autism spectrum and control group (area under the curve 0.89 and 0.91) while the Stereotypic Behaviors/ Restricted Areas of Interest score differentiated less (0.72). Using a cut-off score of 14.5 for the SCQ Total score, sensivity was 0.84, specificity was 0.81, positive predictive value was 0.82 and negative predictive value was 0.83. Using a cut-off score of 7.5 for the SCQ Reciprocal Social Interaction score, sensivity, specifity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0.91, 0.82, 0.83, 0.90, respectively Conclusion: The results indicated that in children younger than 60 months of age the SCQ Total score can differentiate subjects with autism spectrum disorders from children with developmental delay and typically developing controls; however, the Reciprocal Social Interactions score was more sensitive and specific. On the other hand, the negative and positive predictive values indicated that there was a fair percentage of false negatives and positives. Our results showed that, particularly in younger children, the Reciprocal Social Interaction items were more specific and were more helpful for differentiation of the children with autism spectrum disorders. The availability of the SCQ as a shorter and more practical form of the Autism Diagnostic Interview, revised in Turkish, is important as both a research and clinical tool.

Abstract = {Our study estimates the sensitivity and specificity of Medicare claims to identify clinically-diagnosed dementia, and documents how errors in dementia assessment affect dementia cost estimates. We compared Medicare claims from 1993-2005 to clinical dementia assessments carried out in 2001–2003 for the Aging Demographics and Memory Study (ADAMS) cohort (n = 758) of the Health and Retirement Study. The sensitivity and specificity of Medicare claims was 0.85 and 0.89 for dementia (0.64 and 0.95 for AD). Persons with dementia cost the Medicare program (in 2003) $7,135 more than controls (P < 0.001) when using claims to identify dementia, compared to $5,684 more when using ADAMS (P <0.001). Using Medicare claims to identify dementia results in a 110% increase in costs for those with dementia as compared to a 68% increase when using ADAMS to identify disease, net of other variables. Persons with false positive Medicare claims notations of dementia were the most expensive group of subjects ($11,294 versus $4,065, for true negatives P <0.001). Medicare claims overcount the true prevalence of dementia, but there are both false positive and negative assessments of disease. The use of Medicare claims to identify dementia results in an overstatement of the increase in Medicare costs that are due to dementia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {RCT methodology, to date, has focused on avoiding false-positive results, and, when the RCT "rules" are followed, RCTs are quite successful in doing so. However, the current problems with RCTs lie, not so much in false-positive results, but in false-negative results. Two major factors that, when ignored, can lead to false-negative results are moderators of treatment on outcome (baseline variables that identify subgroups with different effect sizes of treatment on outcome) and mediators of treatment on outcome. In absence of a strong rationale for hypothesizing a moderator or mediator, the best RCT design is a large simple RCT that would focus on the overall effect size. Exploratory studies done on that RCT's dataset after the a priori hypotheses were tested and the results reported, would then be used first to explore the possibility of moderators, and then, within moderated subgroups if any, the possibility of mediators. If then, moderators and mediators with theoretical rationale and empirical justification are found, subsequent RCTs would focus on documenting and elaborating their use in clinical decision-making. It is important to note that subgroup analysis, as has usually been conducted, is not the same as a moderator analysis. In exploratory subgroup analysis, what typically is done is to stratify the sample, say separating men and women, and to test the treatment effect separately in the two strata.

Abstract = {Connectionist simulation was employed to investigate processes that may underlie the relationships between prior expectancies or prejudices and the acquisition of attitudes, under conditions where learners can only discover the valence of attitude objects through directly experiencing them. We compared contexts analogous to learners holding either false negative expectancies ('prejudices') about a subclass of objects that were actually good or false positive expectancies about objects that were actually bad. We introduced expectancy-related bias either by altering the probability of approach, or by varying the rate of learning following experience with good or bad objects. Where feedback was contingent on approach, the false positive expectancies were corrected by experience, but negative prejudices resisted change, since the network avoided objects deemed to be bad, and so received less corrective feedback. These findings are discussed in relation to the effects of intergroup contact and expectancy-confirmation processes in reducing or sustaining prejudice.

Abstract = {Aim: To evaluate the validity and potential value of the parent-completed Infant/Child Monitoring Questionnaire (IMQ) as a screening measure for developmental delay in high-risk infants. Methods: One hundred and forty-one term infants born with moderate or severe newborn encephalopathy (NE) and 374 randomly selected comparison infants were administered a Griffiths Mental Development Scales (GMDS) assessment and an IMQ concurrently. Concordance of classifications between measures was compared for agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false positives and false negatives. Results: Overall, sensitivity and specificity of the IMQ for infants with NE averaged across all age groups was 87%, positive predictive value 57% and negative predictive value 97%. The IMQ did not perform as well for comparison infants with a sensitivity of 50%, specificity 94%, positive predictive value 15% and negative predictive value 99% averaged across all age groups. Overall under-referral for infants with NE was 13%, compared with 50% for comparison infants. Conclusions: Use of the IMQ as an accurate screening measure in infants ‘at risk’ of developmental delay is supported. The low sensitivity of the IMQ for the comparison infants indicates a need for caution when considering its application for general population screening.

Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that induced sad mood is associated with increased accuracy of recall in certain memory tasks; the effects of clinical depression, however, are likely to be quite different. The authors used the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm to examine the impact of clinical depression on erroneous recall of neutral and/or emotional stimuli. Specifically, they presented Deese-Roediger-McDermott lists that were highly associated with negative, neutral, or positive lures and compared participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and nondepressed control participants on the accuracy of their recall of presented material and their false recall of never-presented lures. Compared with control participants, major depressive disorder participants recalled fewer words that had been previously presented but were more likely to falsely recall negative lures; there were no differences between major depressive disorder and control participants in false recall of positive or neutral lures. These findings indicate that depression is associated with false memories of negative material. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We examined the role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in memory retrieval monitoring. Event-related potentials were recorded while patients with VMPFC lesions and matched controls viewed faces of personal acquaintances, and of famous and nonfamous people, and indicated whether they had personally encountered these individuals. Patients were more likely than controls to make both false positive and false negative errors. Both groups showed a large posterior negative wave peaking at ∼170 ms after face onset (N170). In controls, the N170 was larger for both types of familiar faces, regardless of whether overt recognition occurred. Specifically, personal acquaintances that were erroneously judged as unfamiliar evoked the same electrophysiological response as those who were explicitly recognized. Patients’ N170 was not modulated by familiarity suggesting VMPFC lesions disrupt early posterior memory-based preconscious cortical distinctions. Following the N170, there was a significant group difference over frontopolar scalp regions where patients were showing a smaller positive modulation at 230–260 ms for all stimulus types. In patients this modulation correlated highly with reaction times of correct responses, suggesting this early frontal modulation is related to the ability to make rapid correct decisions about memory content. Group differences over anterior sites were also noted at 350 ms after stimulus, reflecting a large sustained negativity of patients’ waveforms, equal across conditions. The findings are consistent with a hypothesis of frontally mediated dual-monitoring system. An early automatic (preconscious) component is followed by a late elaborate process. We hypothesize that when both components are damaged, confabulation may occur. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to measure the reliability, validity, and classification accuracy of a Spanish translation of a measure of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Pathological Gambling (PG). Participants were 263 male and 23 female patients seeking treatment for PG and a matched non-psychiatric control sample of 259 men and 24 women. A Spanish translation of a 19-item measure of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PG (Stinchfield 2003) was administered along with other validity measures. The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were found to be internally consistent with a coefficient alpha of .95 in the combined sample. Evidence of satisfactory convergent validity included moderate to high correlations with other measures of problem gambling. Using the standard DSM-IV cut-score of five, the ten criteria were found to yield satisfactory classification accuracy results with a high hit rate (.95), high sensitivity (.92), high specificity (.99), low false positive (.01), and low false negative rate (.08). Lowering the cut score to four resulted in modest improvements in classification accuracy and reduced the false negative rate from .08 to .05. The Spanish translation of a measure of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PG demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties and a cut score of four improved diagnostic precision.

Abstract = {Reports an error in "Deconstructing Mental Rotation" by Axel Larsen (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Advanced Online Publication, Feb 10, 2014, np). The value of the fixation duration increment, about 15 ms per 60° on simple and complex trials is erroneous. The correct value for the increment is about 7 ms per 60°. The error is found four times in the text: In the second line from the bottom of the “Abstract,” in the seventh line in the section “Integrating Local and Global Analyses of Mental Rotation,” and in the section “Concluding Remarks” 14th and 25th line from the bottom of that section. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-04872-001[/rid].) A random walk model of the classical mental rotation task is explored in two experiments. By assuming that a mental rotation is repeated until sufficient evidence for a match/mismatch is obtained, the model accounts for the approximately linearly increasing reaction times (RTs) on positive trials, flat RTs on negative trials, false alarms and miss rates, effects of complexity, and for the number of eye movement switches between stimuli as functions of angular difference in orientation. Analysis of eye movements supports key aspects of the model and shows that initial processing time is roughly constant until the first saccade switch between stimulus objects, while the duration of the remaining trial increases approximately linearly as a function of angular discrepancy. The increment results from additive effects of (a) a linear increase in the number of saccade switches between stimulus objects, (b) a linear increase in the number of saccades on a stimulus, and (c) a linear increase in the number and in the duration of fixations on a stimulus object. The fixation duration increment was the same on simple and complex trials (about 15 ms per 600), which suggests that the critical orientation alignment take place during fixations at very high speed.

Abstract = {Reports on cases of alleged drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) have increased since the mid-1990s. The aim of this study was to identify the extent and types of drugs found in cases of alleged sexual assault (DFSA) in the Netherlands. In total, 135 cases of alleged DFSA were identified. Most of the victims were women (94%), and the mean age of the victims was 25 years. Blood and urine samples were tested for the presence of alcohol, drugs (drugs of abuse and prescription drugs), or both. In 27% of the cases, no alcohol and ⁄ or drugs were found. With increasing time delay, more cases were found to be negative. Alcohol is the most commonly found drug followed by nonopiate analgesics, illicit drugs, and benzodiazepines. In some cases, the absence of alcohol and drugs may represent false-negative results owing to the time delay between alleged sexual assault and sampling.

Abstract = {Sick preterm and term newborns are highly vulnerable to neural injury, and thus there has been a major search for new, safe and efficacious neuro protective interventions in recent decades. Preclinical studies are essential to select candidate drugs for clinical trials in humans. This article focuses on 'negative' preclinical studies, i.e. studies where significant differences cannot be detected. Such findings are critical to inform both clinical and preclinical investigators, but historically they have been difficult to publish. A significant amount of time and resources is lost when negative results or nonpromising therapeutics are replicated in separate laboratories because these negative results were not shared with the research community in an open and accessible format. In this article, we discuss approaches to strengthen conclusions from negative preclinical studies and, conversely, to reduce false-negative preclinical evaluations of potential therapeutic compounds. Without being exhaustive, we address three major issues in conducting and interpreting preclinical experiments, including: (a) the choice of animal models, (b) the experimental design, and (c) issues concerning statistical analyses of the experiments. This general introduction is followed by synopses of negative data obtained from studies of three potential therapeutics for perinatal brain injury: (1) the somatostatin analog octreotide, (2) an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, to piramate, and (3) a pyruvate derivative, ethyl pyruvate.

Abstract = {Background: Postnatal depression (PND) is a serious condition associated with negative consequences for the wellbeing of mother and infant. In the UK routine screening for PND is not currently recommended, although the use of two case finding questions in routine practice to identify PND has been advocated in policy guidance. The diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of the two questions has been reviewed in general population samples; however a review of their validity in postnatal populations is unknown. The aim of this rapid review was to identify studies of DTA of two case finding questions (2CFQ) for PND detection. Methods: DTA studies were included which compared the 2CFQ to gold standard diagnostic criteria. Sources searched included Medline, PsychInfo, Medion, ARIF and cited reference search via Web of Science. Results: Seven studies were identified which used a two question instrument to detect PND. Only one study compared the 2CFQ to standardised diagnostic criteria in a USA postnatal population. The test reported 100% sensitivity and 62% specificity at 4 postnatal weeks. The test was excellent at 'ruling out' PND given a negative response to both questions. False positive rates were high indicating unnecessary follow-up for a substantial number of women. Conclusion: The review found limited evidence for use of the 2CFQ approach to detect PND. Further primary research should be undertaken to assess the DTA of the 2CFQ approach recommended for use in UK postnatal populations; this will ultimately inform the utility of current UK policy guidance.

Abstract = {Background: Behavioral and electrophysiological human ketamine models of schizophrenia are used for testing compounds that target the glutamatergic system. However, corresponding functional neuroimaging models are difficult to reconcile with functional imaging and electrophysiological findings in schizophrenia. Resolving the discrepancies between different observational levels is critical to understand the complex pharmacological ketamine action and its usefulness for modeling schizophrenia pathophysiology. Methods: We conducted a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacoimaging study in twenty-four male volunteers. Subjects were given low-dose S-ketamine (bolus prior to functional imaging: 0.1 mg/kg during 5 min, thereafter continuous infusion: 0.015625 mg/kg/min reduced by 10% every ten minutes) or placebo while performing a visual oddball task during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with continuous recording of event-related potentials (P300) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Before and after intervention, psychopathological status was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale. Results: P300 amplitude and corresponding BOLD responses were diminished in the ketamine condition in cortical regions being involved in sensory processing/selective attention. In both measurement modalities separation of drug conditions was achieved with area under the curve (AUC) values of up to 0.8–0.9. Ketamine effects were also observed in the clinical, behavioral and peripheral physiological domains (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, reaction hit and false alarm rate, electrodermal activity and heart rate) which were in part related to the P300/fMRI measures. Conclusion: The findings from our ketamine experiment are consistent across modalities and directly related to observations in schizophrenia supporting the validity of the model. Our investigation provides the first prototypic example of a pharmacoimaging study using simultaneously acquired fMRI/EEG. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Bootstrap methods have recently been introduced to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate the measurement uncertainty of ensuing diffusion parameters directly from the acquired data without the necessity to assume a noise model. These methods have been previously combined with deterministic streamline tractography algorithms to allow for the assessment of connection probabilities in the human brain. Thereby, the local noise induced disturbance in the diffusion data is accumulated additively due to the incremental progression of streamline tractography algorithms. Graph based approaches have been proposed to overcome this drawback of streamline techniques. For this reason, the bootstrap method is in the present work incorporated into a graph setup to derive a new probabilistic fiber tractography method, called BootGraph. The acquired data set is thereby converted into a weighted, undirected graph by defining a vertex in each voxel and edges between adjacent vertices. By means of the cone of uncertainty,which is derived using the wild bootstrap, a weight is thereafter assigned to each edge. Two path finding algorithms are subsequently applied to derive connection probabilities. While the first algorithm is based on the shortest path approach, the second algorithm takes all existing paths between two vertices into consideration. Tracking results are compared to an established algorithm based on the bootstrap method in combination with streamline fiber tractography and to another graph based algorithm. The BootGraph shows a very good performance in crossing situations with respect to false negatives and permits incorporating additional constraints, such as a curvature threshold. By inheriting the advantages of the bootstrap method and graph theory, the BootGraph method provides a computationally efficient and flexible probabilistic tractography setup to compute connection probability maps and virtual fiber pathways without the drawbacks of streamline tractography algorithms or the assumption of a noise distribution. Moreover, the BootGraph can be applied to common DTI data sets without further modifications and shows a high repeatability. Thus, it is very well suited for longitudinal studies and meta-studies based on DTI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The Self Harm Questionnaire (SHQ) aiming at identification of self-harm in adolescents has been developed and piloted in a sample of 12–17 year olds (n = 100). The adolescents were recruited from both in- and outpatient psychiatric services. Concurrent validity of the SHQ was evaluated by comparing the SHQ results with recorded self harm in the entire clinical records, while the predictive value of the SHQ was assessed by reviewing the clinical records for further episodes of self harm after three months. 71% of the young people endorsed self harm on the SHQ. While 3% showed a false negative result on the SHQ, 20% of the participants disclosed self harm on the SHQ, which was not recorded in their clinical records. At three months follow up there was no statistically significant difference in either sensitivity .95, 95% CI [.72, 1.0] vs. .74, 95% CI [.49, .90] or specificity .35, 95% CI [.25, .46] vs. .51, 95% CI [.39, .62] between the SHQ and the entire clinical record in predicting future episodes of self harm. The SHQ is an important addition to the clinical repertoire designed to improve identification of self harm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: It is important to monitor alcohol use in the care of patients with liver disease, but patient self-report can be unreliable. We therefore evaluated the performance of urine ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) in detecting alcohol use in the days preceding a clinical encounter. Methods: Subjects (n = 120) were recruited at a university-based hepatology clinic or during hospitalization. Alcohol consumption was ascertained by validated self-report measures. Urine EtG (cutoff 100 ng/ml) and EtS (cutoff 25 ng/ml) concentrations were assayed by a contracted laboratory using tandem mass spectrometry. The sensitivity and specificity of each biomarker in the detection of drinking during the 3 and 7 days preceding the clinic visit were determined, as well as the influence of liver disease severity on these results. Results: Urine EtG (sensitivity 76%, specificity 93%) and urine EtS (sensitivity 82%, specificity 86%) performed well in identifying recent drinking, and liver disease severity does not affect biomarker performance. After elimination of 1 false-negative self-report, urine EtG > 100 ng/ml was 100% specific for drinking within the past week, whereas 9% of the subjects without evidence of alcohol drinking for at least 1 week had EtS > 25 ng/ml. Conclusions: Urine EtG and EtS can objectively supplement the detection of recent alcohol use in patients with liver disease. Additional research may determine optimal methods for integrating these tests into clinical care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Several self-report instruments were developed to capture psychotic prodrome, and were claimed to have good predictive validity. The feasibility of screening is questionable considering the heterogeneity of the targeted populations and the negative ramifications of false positive identification. This study developed a questionnaire using data covering a wide range of clinical characteristics. Methods: One hundred and eleven putative pre-psychotic participants, 129 normal comparison subjects, and 95 non-psychotic psychiatric outpatients completed a 231-item questionnaire comprising a 110-item Wisconsin psychotic prone scale, 74-item schizotypal personality questionnaire, 33-item basic symptoms, and 14-item cognitive symptoms. Items showing the best discriminating power, estimated using chi-square statistics with Bonferroni correction,were extracted to create a brief version. A two-stage cut-off approach emphasizing specific items was applied to maximize sensitivity and specificity. The concurrent validity of the proposed approach was estimated using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure. Results: A 15-item self-report questionnaire was developed. Respondents checking at least eight items, or those checking three to seven items including any of the three referring to feeling stress in crowds, aloofness, and perceptual disturbance, would be considered putatively pre-psychotic with the largest sensitivity+specificity (0.784+0.705=1.489). This cut-off selection was the best estimate by calculating 1000 permutations in the cross-validation procedure. Conclusions: This investigation proposes a different orientation for applying questionnaires to screen putative pre-psychotic states, with less emphasis on attenuated psychotic symptoms and predictive values. Besides providing a handy tool for increasing awareness and referral, the instructions of such a screening questionnaire should be carefully worded.

Abstract = {Purpose: To prevent the recurrence of child maltreatment, actuarial risk assessment can help child protective services (CPS) workers make more accurate and consistent decisions. However, there are few published articles describing construction methodologies and performance criteria to evaluate how well actuarial risk assessments perform in CPS. This article describes methodology to construct and revise an actuarial risk assessment, reviews criteria to evaluate the performance of actuarial tools, and applies a methodology and performance criteria in one state. Methods: The sample included 6832 families who were followed for two years to determine whether they were re-reported and re-substantiated for maltreatment. Results: Both the adopted and the revised tools had adequate separation and good predictive accuracy for all families and for the state's three largest ethnic/racial groups (White, Latino, and African American). The adopted tool classified relatively few families in the low-risk category; the revised tool distributed families across risk categories. Conclusions: The revised tool classified more families as low-risk, allowing CPS to allocate more resources to higher-risk families, but at the cost of more false negatives.

Abstract = {Objective: The objective was to identify a potential core set of brief screeners for the detection of individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) in medical settings. Method: Data were from two multisite studies that evaluated stimulant use outcomes of an abstinence-based contingency management intervention as an addition to usual care (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network trials 006–007). The sample comprised 847 substance-using adults who were recruited from 12 outpatient substance abuse treatment settings across the United States. Alcohol and drug use disorders were assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Checklist. Data were analyzed by factor analysis, item response theory (IRT), sensitivity and specificity procedures. Results: Comparatively prevalent symptoms of dependence, especially inability to cut down for all substances, showed high sensitivity for detecting an SUD (low rate of false negative). IRT-defined severe (infrequent) and low discriminative items, especially withdrawal for alcohol, cannabis and cocaine, had low sensitivity in identifying cases of an SUD. IRT-defined less severe (frequent) and high discriminative items, including inability to cut down or taking larger amounts than intended for all substances and withdrawal for amphetamines and opioids, showed good-to-high values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in classifying cases and noncases of an SUD. Conclusion: Findings suggest the feasibility of identifying psychometrically reliable substance dependence symptoms to develop a two-item screen for alcohol and drug disorders.

Abstract = {One important consideration in the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as set forth in the criterion D of DSM-IV, is the assessment of clinically significant impairment in social and academic functioning. Despite the avowed importance in the assessment of ADHD, there is little guidance in DSM-IV in defining impairment. Rating scales assessing impairment are few in number and rarely used in clinical practice. Overlooking impairment in diagnostic approaches has strong clinical implications, leading to false positive or false negative diagnoses. The relation between impairment and symptoms remains currently undefined and a controversial field in the ADHD literature, as many children can display the full range of ADHD symptoms without necessarily displaying significant impairment in their functioning. The relation between symptoms and impairment is more obvious in older children, where domains of impairment are more expanded. This finding suggests that symptoms and impairment are related, but yet there are distinct domains that should be measured independently to confirm the presence of ADHD. In conclusion, an operational definition of impairment, valid measures and diagnostic decision rules for incorporating impairment into the assessment of ADHD is warranted. Additional research is also needed to determine whether the age of onset of symptoms (before the age of seven) is different or should be separated from the age of onset of impairment.

Abstract = {We compared the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Mini-Mult Depression Scale (Mini-D) in a sample of 87 geriatric medical outpatients who were classified as depressed or non-depressed with the DSM-III-based Symptom Checklist for Major Depressive Disorders (SCMDD). In addition, we evaluated the relationship between GDS and Mini-D depression classifications and performances on three tests of the overall cognitive functioning. Although GDS and Mini-D classifications were in moderate agreement with those of the SCMDD (71%), the former measure produced more false-positive errors and the latter produced more false-negative errors. Because neither the GDS nor the Mini-D affords entirely satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, appreciation of these operating characteristics will enable practitioners to select the instrument that yields the most acceptable balance of Type I and Type II errors within their particular clinical settings. Although participants demonstrated signs of a mild cognitive compromise, no relationship was noted between depression classification and overall cognitive functioning.

Abstract = {Monitoring the level of consciousness in brain-injured patients with disorders of consciousness is crucial as it provides diagnostic and prognostic information. Behavioral assessment remains the gold standard for assessing consciousness but previous studies have shown a high rate of misdiagnosis. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) entropy measurements in differentiating unconscious (coma or vegetative) from minimally conscious patients. Left fronto-temporal EEG recordings (10-minute resting state epochs) were prospectively obtained in 56 patients and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers. Patients were assessed in the acute (≤1 month post-injury; n = 29) or chronic (>1 month post-injury; n = 27) stage. The etiology was traumatic in 23 patients. Automated online EEG entropy calculations (providing an arbitrary value ranging from 0 to 91) were compared with behavioral assessments (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised) and outcome. EEG entropy correlated with Coma Recovery Scale total scores (r = 0.49). Mean EEG entropy values were higher in minimally conscious (73 ± 19; mean and standard deviation) than in vegetative/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients (45 ± 28). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an entropy cut-off value of 52 differentiating acute unconscious from minimally conscious patients (sensitivity 89% and specificity 90%). In chronic patients, entropy measurements offered no reliable diagnostic information. EEG entropy measurements did not allow prediction of outcome. User-independent time-frequency balanced spectral EEG entropy measurements seem to constitute an interesting diagnostic—albeit not prognostic—tool for assessing neural network complexity in disorders of consciousness in the acute setting. Future studies are needed before using this tool in routine clinical practice, and these should seek to improve automated EEG quantification paradigms in order to reduce the remaining false negative and false positive findings.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by D.W. Schapmire et al. (see record [rid]2010-22489-010[/rid]). They conclude that pain does not reasonably explain the failure of a statistically based validity criteria for detecting sincerity of effort and that their protocol is appropriate for use in a client population. There are, however, some serious concerns surrounding this paper that we wish to bring forward. These concerns are related to 1) the determinants of variability in motor behavior, especially disability behaviors; 2) the scientific methods used; and 3) the overall tone of the paper. Although many arguments we will make are interrelated, we will explain each of these concerns separately and conclude with a different view on FCE that is, in our opinion, more balanced and supported by current literature. No human being can consistently behave consistently, and this holds true for people with and without pain. However, Schapmire and colleagues use a lack of variability in motor behavior when subjects are distracted as their implicit theoretical basis for determining validity of effort. To our judgment, the FCE literature including this paper of Schapmire and colleagues has not provided evidence to support such claims. It is our personal opinion that FCEs should not be used for these purposes, because of the huge personal implications for the individuals being judged combined with unknown rates of false positives and false negatives within actual clinical samples.

Abstract = {Comments on an article, Error management theory: A new perspective on biases in cross-sex mind reading by M. G. Haselton & D. M. Buss (2000). According to error management theory (EMT). Error management theory: a new perspective on biases in cross-sex mind reading. This article evolved psychological mechanisms can lead to systematic cognitive errors whenever costs of false—positive and false—negative decisions have been asymmetrical over evolutionary history. In a courtship context, sex differences in reading commitment intent in a potential partner seem to be a result of these psychological mechanisms. EMT predicts a bias in women toward underperception of men's commitment intentions. Haselton and Buss found evidence for a commitment—skepticism bias in studies testing young women. These findings have not been replicated yet in the published literature. The present two studies compared postmenopausal women with fertile women in a German sample, extending EMT with a life—history perspective. According to the original commitment—skepticism hypothesis, women err on the side of underestimating prospective mates' commitment to avoid the high costs of pregnancy without support. We hypothesize that for postmenopausal women the costs of errors would be more equal or possibly reversed, such that these women face greater costs of missed opportunities with investing partners who could assist them in caring for extant offspring and grand offspring than from falsely assuming that a partner was committed. Therefore, we hypothesize that commitment–skepticism will not occur in postmenopausal women. Confirming our predictions, whereas we replicated the commitment—skepticism in the younger sample, postmenopausal women did not show a bias toward underinferring men's commitment intentions.

Abstract = {Gunderson (2010) recently offered a sharp criticism of the draft proposal for diagnosing personality disorders in DSM-5. Based on a review of phenomenological, factor analytic, social psychology, family, neurobiological, and treatment studies of borderline personality disorder (BPD), he proposed an alternative revision of the BPD criteria. One of the suggested changes was a modification of the DSM-IV diagnostic algorithm. Gunderson did not, however, provide any data on the impact this new diagnostic algorithm would have on the prevalence of BPD, or the validity of this alternative approach compared to the DSM-IV algorithm. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project we administered semi-structured diagnostic interviews to 3,081 psychiatric outpatients and examined diagnostic concordance between DSM-IV and Gunderson's proposal, and whether there is incremental validity in Gunderson's diagnostic approach. The results did not indicate that the alternative diagnostic algorithm improved validity, and, depending on the threshold used, could result in false negative diagnoses.

Abstract = {Background: A current proposal for the DSM-5 general anxiety disorder (GAD) definition is to remove fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbance from the list of associated symptoms, and to require the presence of one of two retained symptoms (restlessness or muscle tension) for diagnosis. Relevant evaluations in youth to support such a change are sparse. Methods: The present study evaluated patterns and correlates of the DSM-IV GAD associated symptoms in a large outpatient sample of anxious youth (N = 650) to empirically consider how the proposed diagnostic change might impact the prevalence and sample composition of GAD in children. Results: Logistic regression found irritability to be the most associated, and restlessness to be the least associated, with GAD diagnosis. Fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances—which have each been suggested to be nonspecific to GAD due to their prevalence in depression—showed sizable associations with GAD even after accounting for depression and attention problems. Among GAD youth, 10.9% would not meet the proposed DSM-5 associated symptoms criterion. These children were comparable to GAD youth who would meet the proposed criteria with regard to clinical severity, symptomatology, and functioning. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of youth with excessive, clinically impairing worry may be left unclassified by the DSM-5 if the proposed GAD associated symptoms criterion is adopted. Despite support for the proposed criterion change in adult samples, the present findings suggest that in children it may increase the false negative rate. This calls into question whether the proposed associated symptoms criterion is optimal for defining childhood GAD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Screening for a major depressive episode (MDE) in high-risk groups of patients within the primary care setting has been suggested by several Central Health Organizations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether patients rated as “psychiatric cases” by their general practitioner (GP) were likely to suffer from MDE and therefore qualified for systematic diagnostic screening. Design: Cross-sectional survey of primary care patients assessed through depression screening questionnaires and GP consultations. Setting: A total of 676 general practices in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Subjects: A total of 8879 unselected primary care patients. Main outcome measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and Youden Index of the GPs' diagnoses of depression and psychiatric caseness versus patients' MDE status. Results: The proportion of primary care patients receiving a false-positive diagnosis of depression by their GP ranged from 12.4% to 25.2% depending on country. The corresponding numbers for the false-negative diagnoses were 0.5–2.5%. Among patients with MDE, GPs recognize the disease in 56–75% of cases. However, GPs recognize as many as 79–92% of patients with MDE as “psychiatric cases”. Conclusions: This report confirms that misclassifications of MDE are common in the primary care setting. In addition, it shows that psychiatric caseness is a valid marker for the presence of MDE in primary care patients. This relationship should be considered in future screening recommendations.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by M. B. First (see record [rid]2010-22931-010[/rid]). The single most important point in First’s letter, as I understand it, is this: An uncooperative patient cannot be diagnosed with a specific paraphilia on the sole grounds that he has offended against x or more victims in a way symptomatic of that paraphilia, because such a practice would produce an excessive number of false positive diagnoses. First's view is related to the notion that behavior is a more fallible indicator of paraphilia than is self-report. He further asserts that a diagnostic criterion for uncooperative subjects based on a minimum number of individual victims would produce excessive false negatives as well as false positives, because it neglects the frequency of sexual interactions with a given victim and the time period over which repeated interactions with that victim occurred. First writes, in places, as if the unacceptable false positive rate that would result from diagnosing paraphilias by victim count were self-evident or already known as fact. First devotes a substantial proportion of his letter to explaining the vicissitudes of behavior in the diagnostic criteria for the paraphilias in DSM-IV. First's preference for patterns over counts may be based on a feeling that patterns are in the spirit of the DSM whereas counts are not. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: MS-pathogenesis is known to involve both multiple environmental events, and several independent genetic risk-factors. Methods: A model of susceptibility is developed and a mathematical analysis undertaken to elucidate the nature of genetic susceptibility to MS and to understand the constraints that are placed on the genetic basis of MS, both by the known epidemiological facts of this disease and by the known frequency of the HLA DRB1*1501 allele in the general populations of northern Europe and North America. Results: For the large majority of cases (possibly all), MS develops, in part, because an individual is genetically susceptible. Nevertheless, 2.2% or less of the general population is genetically susceptible. Moreover, from the model, the number of susceptibility-loci that need to be in a “susceptible allelic state” to produce MS-susceptibility is small (11-18), whereas the total number of such susceptibility-loci is large (50-200), and their “frequency of susceptibility” is low (i.e., ≤ 0.12). The optimal solution to the model equations (which occurs when 80% of the loci are recessive) predicts the epidemiological data quite closely. Conclusions: The model suggests that combinations of only a small number of genetic loci in a “susceptible allelic state” produce MS-susceptibility. Nevertheless, genome-wide associations studies with hundreds of thousands of SNPs, are plagued by both false-positive and false-negative identifications and, consequently, emphasis has been rightly placed on the replicability of findings. Nevertheless, because genome-wide screens don’t distinguish between true susceptibility-loci and disease-modifying-loci, and because only true susceptibility-loci are constrained by the model, unraveling the two will not be possible using this approach. The model also suggests that HLA DRB1 may not be as uniquely important for MS-susceptibility as currently believed. Thus, this allele is only one among a hundred or more loci involved in MS susceptibility. Even though the “frequency of susceptibility” at the HLA DRB1 locus is four-fold that of other loci, the penetrance of those susceptible genotypes that include this allele is no different from those that don’t. Also, almost 50% of genetically-susceptible individuals, lack this allele. Moreover, of those who have it, only a small fraction (≤ 5.2%) are even susceptible to getting MS.

Abstract = {Objective: The present study was designed to test some assumptions about screening procedures for ADHD in adults. Method: Twenty-eight incarcerated male adults completed a self report scale of attention deficits as a part of an examination of attention and reading skills. Further assessment of attention included a battery of tests that assessed vigilance, attention shifts, and other aspects of cognitive control. Results: Fifty seven percent of the sample showed test performance indicating a high probability of ADHD. Correlation analyses yielded significant effects for self report scales and objective tests of attention. Conclusion: The results support the assumption that the self report measures share a significant part of the variance with tests of attention commonly used in clinical assessment. However, the risk of making both false positive and false negative inferences about ADHD is present, as the specificity and the sensitivity of the rating scale needs to be further explored.

Abstract = {The present study focuses on both the clinical symptom of confabulation and experimentally induced false memories in patients suffering from Korsakoff’s syndrome. Despite the vast amount of case studies of confabulating patients and studies investigating false memories in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm, the nature of Korsakoff patients’ confabulatory behaviour and its association with DRM false memories have been rarely examined. Hence, the first aim of the present study was to evaluate confabulatory responses in a large sample of chronic Korsakoff patients and matched controls by means of the Dalla Barba Confabulation Battery. Second, the association between (provoked) confabulation and the patients’ DRM false recognition performance was investigated. Korsakoff patients mainly confabulated in response to questions about episodic memory and questions to which the answer was unknown. A positive association was obtained between confabulation and the tendency to accept unstudied distractor words as being old in the DRM paradigm. On the other hand, there was a negative association between confabulation and false recognition of critical lures. The latter could be attributed to the importance of strategic retrieval at delayed memory testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Purpose: A barrier to using HRQOL questionnaires for individual patient management is knowing what score represents a problem deserving attention. We explored using needs assessments to identify HRQOL scores associated with patient-reported unmet needs. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 117 cancer patients (mean age 61 years; 51% men; 77% white) who completed the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS) and EORTC QLQ-C30. SCNS scores were dichotomized as “no unmet need” versus “some unmet need” and served as an external criterion for identifying problem scores. We evaluated the discriminative ability of QLQ-C30 scores using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Domains with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) ≥ .70 were examined further to determine how well QLQ-C30 scores predicted presence/absence of unmet need. Results: We found AUCs ≥ .70 for 6 of 14 EORTC domains: physical, emotional, role, global QOL, pain, fatigue. All 6 domains had sensitivity ≥ .85 and specificity ≥ .50. EORTC domains that closely matched the content of SCNS item(s) were more likely to have AUCs ≥ .70. The appropriate cut-off depends on the relative importance of false positives and false negatives. Conclusions: Needs assessments can identify HRQOL scores requiring clinicians’ attention. Future research should confirm these findings using other HRQOL questionnaires and needs assessments.

We used the classic Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm to compare false memory production in schizophrenia patients who were currently experiencing delusions (ED), patients not experiencing delusions (ND) and healthy control participants. The ED group recalled twice as many false-positive memories (i.e., memory for words not previously seen) as both the controls and crucially, the ND group. Both patient groups also recognised fewer correct words than the healthy controls and both showed greater confidence in their false memories; however, on the recognition task, the ED group made more false-negative (i.e. rejecting previously seen words) high confidence responses than the ND group.

Abstract = {The determination of brain death is based on a comprehensive clinical assessment. A confirmatory test—at least, in adult patients in the United States—is not mandatory, but it typically is used as a safeguard or added when findings on clinical examination are unwontedly incomplete. In other countries, confirmatory tests are mandatory; in many, they are optional. These tests can be divided into those that test the brain's electrical function and those that test cerebral blood flow. A false-positive result (i.e., the test result suggests brain death, but clinically the patient does not meet the criteria) is not common but has been described for tests frequently used to determine brain death. A false-negative result (i.e., the test result suggests intact brain function, but clinically the patient meets the criteria) in one test may result in more confirmatory tests and no resolution when the test results diverge. Also, pathologic studies have shown that considerable areas of viable brain tissue may remain in patients who meet the clinical criteria of brain death, a fact that makes these tests less diagnostic. Confirmatory tests are residua from earlier days of refining comatose states. A comprehensive clinical examination, when performed by skilled examiners, should have perfect diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract = {This study investigated multiple models for assessing oral reading fluency, including 1-minute oral reading measures that produce scores reported as words correct per minute (wcpm). The authors compared a measure of wcpm with measures of the individual and combined indicators of oral reading fluency (rate, accuracy, prosody, and comprehension) to examine construct, criterion, and consequential validity. Oral reading data and standardized comprehension test scores were analyzed for students in grades 2, 4, and 6. The results indicate that assessments designed to include multiple indicators of oral reading fluency provided a finer-grained understanding of oral reading fluency and fluency assessment and a stronger predictor of general comprehension. Comparisons across grade levels also revealed developmental differences in the relation between oral reading fluency and comprehension, and in the relative contributions of oral fluency indicators to comprehension. When commonly used benchmarks were applied to wcpm scores to identify students at risk of reading difficulty, both false positives and false negatives were found. This study raises issues regarding the alignment of oral reading fluency definitions and assessment. It also raises concerns about the widespread use of wcpm measures and benchmarks to identify students at risk of reading difficulty and to plan instruction.

Abstract = {Performance on the Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT) was examined in 193 consecutively referred patients aged 8 through 17 years who had sustained a mild traumatic brain injury. A total of 33 participants failed to meet actuarial criteria for valid effort on the MSVT. After accounting for possible false positives and false negatives, the base rate of suboptimal effort in this clinical sample was 17%. Only one MSVT failure was thought to be influenced by litigation. The present results suggest that a sizable minority of children is capable of putting forth suboptimal effort during neuropsychological exam, even when external incentives are not readily apparent. The MSVT appears to have good potential value as an objective measure for detecting symptom invalidity in school-age youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {It is important both clinically and forensically to gain information to provide an understanding of the veracity of a child’s allegations of sexual abuse. Even though it is reasonable to hypothesize that most allegations are true—children are not infallible and thus some allegations are false. A systematic model of pathways to false allegations—however rare or common—is important because so much depends on this question (i.e., both false positives and false negatives are harmful to children). We propose that there are two major pathways to false allegations of child sexual abuse: (1) the child is lying and (2) the child has a false memory due to his or her problems in information processing. We conclude by presenting a more detailed protocol for more formally evaluating these pathways to false allegations in specific cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Rational decision theory could be more fully exploited for the prudent management of uncertain-risk situations. After an integrative circumscription of the precautionary principle (PP), 10 key issues are discussed covering assessment, decision and control. In view of this, a variety of decision-theoretic considerations are explored. ‘Sufficient evidence’ for precautionary action is treated as a diagnostic decision in the framework of signal detection theory. Thus, an assessment about ‘danger’ versus ‘no danger’ should depend on prior probability, evidence strength and the relative seriousness of false-positive versus false-negative outcomes. From an illustrated survey of simple and more complex decision rules, it appears that ‘precaution’ may be variously expressed via, for example, maximin utility, minimax regret, maximin expected utility and maximising expected utility-minus-regret. Logically, serious uncertain risk (against modest benefits) may provoke a precautionary approach—under the PP. In contrast, however, an uncertain ‘great opportunity’ (against modest costs) may elicit a venturous approach—following the venture principle (VP). Thus, the PP amounts to a basic attitude rather than a normative principle, whose practical application hinges on straightforward albeit uncertain decision variables. Decision postponement, temporal discounting and risk–risk tradeoffs are summarily reviewed. General conclusions are drawn and some suggestions for policy-making and further research are proposed.

Abstract = {Objective: This study examined whether benefits of conflict probe automation would occur in a future air traffic scenario in which air traffic service providers (ATSPs) are not directly responsible for freely maneuvering aircraft but are controlling other nonequipped aircraft (mixed-equipage environment). The objective was to examine how the type of automation imperfection (miss vs. false alarm) affects ATSP performance and attention allocation. Background: Research has shown that the type of automation imperfection leads to differential human performance costs. Method: Participating in four 30-min scenarios were 12 full-performance-level ATSPs. Dependent variables included conflict detection and resolution performance, eye movements, and subjective ratings of trust and self confidence. Results: ATSPs detected conflicts faster and more accurately with reliable automation, as compared with manual performance. When the conflict probe automation was unreliable, conflict detection performance declined with both miss (25% conflicts detected) and false alarm automation (50% conflicts detected). Conclusion: When the primary task of conflict detection was automated, even highly reliable yet imperfect automation (miss or false alarm) resulted in serious negative effects on operator performance. Application: The further in advance that conflict probe automation predicts a conflict, the greater the uncertainty of prediction; thus, designers should provide users with feedback on the state of the automation or other tools that allow for inspection and analysis of the data underlying the conflict probe algorithm.

Abstract = {This review summarises recent systematic reviews and evidence-based guidelines that deal with the issue of how best to diagnose or define obesity in children and adolescents. A recent systematic review showed that parents typically fail to recognise obesity in their children and adolescents, and a good deal of other evidence suggests that health professionals under-diagnose obesity in children and adolescents when using informal methods based on observation. There is therefore a need for practical, objective, methods that both identify the fattest children and adolescents adequately, and identify those who are at greatest risk of the 'co-morbidities' of obesity. A large body of consistent evidence shows that a high body mass index (BMI) for age and sex identifies the fattest children adequately, with low-moderate false negative rate and a low false positive rate. Furthermore, children and adolescents at high BMI for age are at much greater risk of the co-morbidities of obesity. A recent systematic review found that the use of BMI for age with national reference data and cut-off points (such as the 95th percentile to define obesity) was superior to the Cole-International Obesity Task Force international approach for defining obesity based on BMI for age. The same systematic review also found no evidence that use of waist circumference for age improved the diagnosis of obesity, or the cardio-metabolic co-morbidities of obesity, in children and adolescents. Recent systematic reviews are therefore supportive of current guidelines that recommend percentile-based cut-offs relative to national reference data to (e.g. BMI at or above the 95th or 98th percentile in the UK) to define obesity for clinical applications in children and adolescents.

Abstract = {The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in non-human primates is on the increase. It is known that the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal varies not only as a function of local neuronal energy consumption but also as a function of cardiac and respiratory activity. We mapped these cyclic cardiac and respiratory artifacts in anesthetized macaque monkeys and present an objective analysis of their impact on estimates of functional connectivity (fcMRI). Voxels with significant cardiac and respiratory artifacts were found in much the same regions as previously reported for awake humans. We show two example seeds where removing the artifacts clearly decreased the number of false positive and false negative correlations. In particular, removing the artifacts reduced correlations in the so-called resting state network. Temporal bandpass filtering or spatial smoothing may help to reduce the effects of artifacts in some cases but are not an adequate replacement for an algorithm that explicitly models and removes cyclic cardiac and respiratory artifacts.

Abstract = {Background: There have been many changes in clinical trials methodology since the introduction of lithium and the beginning of the modern era of psychopharmacology in 1949. The nature and importance of these changes have not been fully addressed to date. As methodological flaws in trials can lead to false-negative or false-positive results, the objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of methodological changes in psychopharmacology clinical research over the past 60 years. Methodology/Principal Findings:We performed a systematic review from 1949 to 2009 on MEDLINE and Web of Science electronic databases, and a hand search of high impact journals on studies of seven major drugs (chlorpromazine, clozapine, risperidone, lithium, fluoxetine and lamotrigine). All controlled studies published 100 months after the first trial were included. Ninety-one studies met our inclusion criteria. We analyzed the major changes in abstract reporting, study design, participants’ assessment and enrollment, methodology and statistical analysis. Our results showed that the methodology of psychiatric clinical trials changed substantially, with quality gains in abstract reporting, results reporting, and statistical methodology. Recent trials use more informed consent, periods of washout, intention-to-treat approach and parametric tests. Placebo use remains high and unchanged over time. Conclusions/Significance: Clinical trial quality of psychopharmacological studies has changed significantly in most of the aspects we analyzed. There was significant improvement in quality reporting and internal validity. These changes have increased study efficiency; however, there is room for improvement in some aspects such as rating scales, diagnostic criteria and better trial reporting. Therefore, despite the advancements observed, there are still several areas that can be improved in psychopharmacology clinical trials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The response-signal speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure was used to investigate the relationship between measures of working memory capacity and the time course of short-term item recognition. High- and low-span participants studied sequentially presented 6-item lists, immediately followed by a recognition probe. Analyses of composite list and serial position SAT functions found no differences in retrieval speed between the 2 span groups. Overall accuracy was higher for high spans than low spans, with more pronounced differences for earlier serial positions. Analysis of false alarms to recent negatives (lures from the previous study list) revealed no differences in the timing or magnitude of early false alarms, thought to reflect familiarity-based judgments. However, analyses of false alarms later in retrieval indicated that recollective information accrues more slowly for low spans, which suggests that recollective information may also contribute less to judgments concerning studied items for low-span participants. These findings can provide an explanation for the greater susceptibility of low spans to interference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Major depression (MD) is the most common psychiatric disorder after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Yet, diagnosing MD is often challenging because of cognitive, emotional, and somatic symptoms that overlap with TBI and other psychiatric disorders. Best current evidence suggests that depressed mood is characterized more by irritability, anger, and aggression than by sadness and tearfulness in persons with TBI. Rumination, self-criticism, and guilt may best differentiate depressed persons from nondepressed persons. Anxiety, aggression, sleep problems, alcohol use, lower-income levels, and poor social functioning appear to be primary associated factors toMD. Objective levels of injury severity, impairment, and functioning do not appear to be related to developing MD. The presence of “organic” TBI sequelae that overlap with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Version IV MD criteria does not appear to lead to false-positive MD diagnoses, and anosognosia does not appear to lead to false-negative MD diagnoses. Only the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 and Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory–Depression demonstrated evidence of acceptably ruling out MD in persons with TBI; the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 had the best ability to rule in the presence of MD following TBI. Apathy, anxiety, dysregulation, and emotional lability require careful clinical consideration when making a differential diagnosis of MD in persons with TBI. Lastly, recommendations are provided on how clinicians can improve diagnostic accuracy and what future research is required to improve our understanding of MD in persons with TBI.

Abstract = {A dangerous paradox threatens the integrity of psychiatric diagnosis and the safety of psychiatric treatment. First arm—the younger the person, the harder it is to make an accurate diagnosis. Kids have very short track records and their individual developmental differences weigh in too heavily and too unpredictably to be very certain what their futures will bring. Second arm—despite this, diagnosing and treating younger and younger children has become an exploding growth industry. The result of the paradox—many kids are mislabeled and are treated unnecessarily, sometimes with medicines that have serious side effects and life-altering complications. Of contextual note: all the recent fads in psychiatric diagnosis have targeted children—a 40-fold increase in childhood bipolar a 20-fold increase in autism, and a tripling of attention deficit disorder. Some of the skyrocketing prevalence doubtless represents beneficial identification of previous false-negatives, but most of the rate jumps probably result from the capture of mislabeled false-positives. Diagnostic ads always result in a big overshoot. The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemic should provide a cautionary tale highlighting the risk of medicalizing what are no more than individual differences in normal development. I am also surprised by parent passivity in the face of this bureaucratic threat to their parental discretion. Given the untried and experimental nature of the intervention, I think that participation should require informed parental consent after the risks have been fully described. And there should be no incentives or penalties to influence decisions. People shouldn't be forced or induced to participate in what amounts to an unproven research study. Simply stated, this is a bad idea on psychiatric grounds and unjustifiable as public policy. Australia will be flying blind and taking on unknown risks for probably illusory gains.

Dr Christensen brings up an important point when considering the utility of dementia screening tests, namely the prevalence of disease. Psychometric properties of screening tests should also be closely examined when deciding how one can best utilize a test and interpret its meaningfulness. The most common properties, namely sensitivity/specificity and predictive values differ greatly in this regard. Dr Christensen correctly points out that the world-wide prevalence of dementia ranges from 2.4% to 19.5% in a meta-analysis of Asia, Europe and the Americas, while the prevalence rates for the studies we have published on the AD8 are significantly higher, being drawn from a longitudinal study and a memory disorders clinic. While the difference in prevalence rates would not impact the sensitivity and specificity of the AD8 with both properties averaging 85% in the multiple studies, the positive predictive value of the AD8 would be significantly lower when applied to a broad population. However, four important points are lost in the discussion. First, population-based studies often underestimate the frequency of Alzheimer's dementia because their diagnostic methods tend not to capture individuals with milder stages of dementia. Second, dementia screening as a secondary prevention measure is proposed as an early detection of symptoms in individuals in whom the disease process has already begun and who may be experiencing very mild clinical symptoms not yet detected in the usual course of medical care. Third, the inherent challenges of broad dementia screening of a population with a low prevalence would be an obstacle with all dementia screening tools. Last, predictive values may not be the most effective method of evaluating screening tests. As we state in the article, dementia screening requires a consideration of the population at risk and the sensitivity and specificity of the instruments used. A large number of false positive individuals might expend limited healthcare dollars; a large number of false negative individuals would be denied treatment and miss opportunities to participate in clinical research. Thus, a staged dementia screening approach would make the most sense clinically and economically. The value of the AD8 is that it is not only brief but corresponds to more detailed evaluations, neuropsychological testing and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, an argument that many other screening tests have not yet made. A more important point we make is that informant-based methods, whether the brief AD8 or the more detailed Clinical Dementia Rating, are at least as good as any objective measures. Thus, if simple screening is the goal, because the AD8 is comparable to the Clinical Dementia Rating both in direct comparison and in its relationship to biomarkers, it could be recommended for this simple goal on the basis of utility and brevity.

Abstract = {Responds to the comments made by Nada L. Stotlan (see record [rid]2010-17469-023[/rid]) on the current authors' original article (see record [rid]2010-04564-011[/rid]). Our article revealed the ineffectiveness of DSM-IV's clinical significance criterion in eliminating major depression false positive diagnoses, suggesting that further efforts are necessary. Dr. Stotland eloquently reminds us that further efforts are also necessary regarding false negatives. She observes that some depressed individuals mask their symptoms, and thus do not appear depressed, yet may be suicidal. However, the described patient satisfies major depression diagnostic criteria, and thus would not logically be a false negative. Finally, as Dr. Stotland observes, many suicides do not result from major depression, nor is there any evidence for the prevalence of the particular type of example she describes. Such affects as anxiety, shame, or rage as well as impulsive reactions to distress or the effects of substance intoxication may be potent triggers of suicidal behavior in some individuals. Moreover, there are also rational deliberative or culturally sanctioned decisions to end one’s life. This variety is reflected in the DSM-5’s useful proposal for a suicide risk assessment scale that would routinely be applied across diagnostic categories.

Abstract = {Background: The San Francisco Syncope Rule has been proposed as a clinical decision rule for risk stratification of patients presenting to the emergency department with syncope. It has been validated across various populations and settings. We undertook a systematic review of its accuracy in predicting short-term serious outcomes. Methods: We identified studies by means of systematic searches in seven electronic databases from inception to January 2011. We extracted study data in duplicate and used a bivariate random-effects model to assess the predictive accuracy and test characteristics. Results: We included 12 studies with a total of 5316 patients, of whom 596 (11%) experienced a serious outcome. The prevalence of serious outcomes across the studies varied between 5% and 26%. The pooled estimate of sensitivity of the San Francisco Syncope Rule was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–0.93), and the pooled estimate of specificity was 0.52 (95% CI 0.43–0.62). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity (resulting in a 95% prediction interval for sensitivity of 0.55–0.98). The probability of a serious outcome given a negative score with the San Francisco Syncope Rule was 5% or lower, and the probability was 2% or lower when the rule was applied only to patients for whom no cause of syncope was identified after initial evaluation in the emergency department. The most common cause of false-negative classification for a serious outcome was cardiac arrhythmia. Interpretation: The San Francisco Syncope Rule should be applied only for patients in whom no cause of syncope is evident after in itial evaluation in the emergency department. Consideration of all available electrocardiograms, as well as arrhythmia monitoring, should be included in application of the San Francisco Syncope Rule. Between-study heterogeneity was likely due to inconsistent classification of arrhythmia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Introduction: The usefulness of diagnostic tests consists of the ability to detect and separate a person with a disease from a healthy person, and not to produce false positives or negatives. The properties of diagnostic tests have traditionally been described using sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. An additional way to consider the probability of a disease is by calculating the likelihood ratio which helps to estimate how many times more (or less) likely patients with a disease are to have a particular result than patients without the disease. Objective: To describe the main properties of diagnostic tests. Important concepts, such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and likelihood ratio are explained, as well as their usefulness and applicability in clinical practice.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test the validity, in the Chinese population, of the Lifting The Burden diagnostic questionnaire for the purpose of a population- based survey of the burden of headache in China. From all regions of China, a population-based sample of 417 respondents had completed the structured questionnaire in a door-to-door survey conducted by neurologists from local hospitals calling unannounced. They were contacted for re-interview by telephone by headache specialists who were unaware of the questionnaire diagnoses. A screening question ascertained whether headache had occurred in the last year. If they had, the specialists applied their expertise and ICHD-II diagnostic criteria to make independent diagnoses which, as the gold standard, were later compared with the questionnaire diagnoses. There were 18 refusals; 399 interviews were conducted in 202 women and 197 men aged 18–65 years (mean age 44.4 ± 12.6 years). In comparison to the specialists’ diagnoses, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Cohen’s kappa (95% CI) of the questionnaire for the diagnosis of migraine were 0.83, 0.99, 0.83, 0.99 and 0.82 (0.71–0.93), respectively; for the diagnosis of tension-type headache (TTH), they were 0.51, 0.99, 0.86, 0.92 and 0.59 (0.46–0.72), respectively. In conclusion, the questionnaire was accurate and reliable in diagnosing migraine (agreement level excellent), less so, but adequate, for TTH (sensitivity relatively low, false negative rate relatively high and agreement level fair to good). The non-specific features of TTH do not lend themselves well to diagnosis by questionnaire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Previous papers have reported that clusterin (CLU, also called apolipoprotein J) maintains amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) solubility and protects against Aβ neurotoxicity. Recently, two large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified that a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the gene has been reported to modify the risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The present study aimed to investigate whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the CLU gene are associated with AD. Methods: Six SNP, genotyped using TaqMan technology, were analyzed using a case–control study design. Furthermore, an analysis of the cases divided according to apolipoprotein E (APO E) status was also carried out. Our case–control dataset consisted of 180 AD patients and 130 age-matched controls. Results: The present study failed to detect any association between the SNP of the CLU gene and AD. Although rs7982 and rs1532277 showed marginal association in the APO E4 negative group, the linkage disequilibrium analysis results suggest this to be a false positive. Conclusion: The negative associations were mainly the result of our small sample size. Larger genetic studies in different ethnics and future meta-analysis are needed to clarify the relationship between the CLU gene and AD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Purpose: To assess how different diagnostic decision aids perform in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and harm. Methods: Four diagnostic decision aids were compared, as applied to a simulated patient population: a findings-based algorithm following a linear or branched pathway, a serial threshold–based strategy, and a parallel threshold– based strategy. Headache in immune-compromised HIV patients in a developing country was used as an example. Diagnoses included cryptococcal meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, tuberculous meningitis, bacterial meningitis, and malaria. Data were derived from literature and expert opinion. Diagnostic strategies’ validity was assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and harm related to mortality and morbidity. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were performed. Results: The parallel threshold– based approach led to a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 65%. Sensitivities of the serial threshold–based approach and the branched and linear algorithms were 47%, 47%, and 74%, respectively, and the specificities were 85%, 95%, and 96%. The parallel threshold–based approach resulted in the least harm, with the serial threshold– based approach, the branched algorithm, and the linear algorithm being associated with 1.56-, 1.44-, and 1.17-times higher harm, respectively. Findings were corroborated by sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses. Conclusion: A threshold-based diagnostic approach is designed to find the optimal trade-off that minimizes expected harm, enhancing sensitivity and lowering specificity when appropriate, as in the given example of a symptom pointing to several life-threatening diseases. Findings-based algorithms, in contrast, solely consider clinical observations. A parallel workup, as opposed to a serial workup, additionally allows for all potential diseases to be reviewed, further reducing false negatives. The parallel threshold–based approach might, however, not be as good in other disease settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We use matched Danish health survey and register data to investigate discrepancies between register-based diagnoses and self-reported morbidity. We hypothesize that false negatives (medical diagnoses existing in the register but not reported in the survey) arise partly because individuals fear career repercussions of being discovered suffering a chronic or severe illness that potentially lowers productivity. We find evidence of substantial underreporting, which is indeed systematically higher for individuals in the labor market. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Recently, Walters (“Dementia: Continuum or distinct entity?”, Psychology and Aging, 2010, 25, 534–544) published a taxometric study suggesting a dimensional latent structure for the construct of dementia. However, because that study did not conceptualize dementia according to accepted conventions (i.e., there were no measures of cognitive change or independent functioning), its results may represent a false negative error caused by insufficient content coverage. We replicated Walters, and we used the same taxometric methods and the same data source—but with indicators of cognitive change and functional independence. Our results support a categorical interpretation of dementia; whereas Walters' results suggest that cognitive ability, rather than dementia, is dimensional in nature.

Abstract = {Latent class analysis (LCA) has been hailed as a promising technique for studying measurement errors in surveys, because the models produce estimates of the error rates associated with a given question. Still, the issue arises as to how accurate these error estimates are and under what circumstances they can be relied on. Skeptics argue that latent class models can understate the true error rates and at least one paper (Kreuter et al., 2008) demonstrates such underestimation empirically. We applied latent class models to data from two waves of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), focusing on a pair of similar items about abortion that are administered under different modes of data collection. The first item is administered by computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI); the second, by audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Evidence shows that abortions are underreported in the NSFG and the conventional wisdom is that ACASI item yields fewer false negatives than the CAPI item. To evaluate these items, we made assumptions about the error rates within various subgroups of the population; these assumptions were needed to achieve an identifiable LCA model. Because there are external data available on the actual prevalence of abortion (by subgroup), we were able to form subgroups for which the identifying restrictions were likely to be (approximately) met and other subgroups for which the assumptions were likely to be violated. We also ran more complex models that took potential heterogeneity within subgroups into account. Most of the models yielded implausibly low error rates, supporting the argument that, under specific conditions, LCA models underestimate the error rates.

Abstract = {Objectives: Using a large image bank, we systematically examined how the use of different ratios of abnormal to normal cases affects trainee learning. Methods: This was a prospective, double‐blind, randomised, three‐arm education trial conducted in six academic training programmes for emergency medicine and paediatric residents in post‐licensure years 2–5. We developed a paediatric ankle trauma radiograph case bank. From this bank, we constructed three different 50‐case training sets, which varied in their proportions of abnormal cases (30%, 50%, 70%). Levels of difficulty and diagnoses were similar across sets. We randomly assigned residents to complete one of the training sets. Users classified each case as normal or abnormal, specifying the locations of any abnormalities. They received immediate feedback. All participants completed the same 20‐case post‐test in which 40% of cases were abnormal. We determined participant sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio and signal detection parameters. Results: A total of 100 residents completed the study. The groups did not differ in accuracy on the post‐test (p = 0.20). However, they showed considerable variation in their sensitivity–specificity trade‐off. The group that received a training set with a high proportion of abnormal cases achieved the best sensitivity (0.69, standard deviation [SD] = 0.24), whereas the groups that received training sets with medium and low proportions of abnormal cases demonstrated sensitivities of 0.63 (SD = 0.21) and 0.51 (SD = 0.24), respectively (p < 0.01). Conversely, the group with a low proportion of abnormal cases demonstrated the best specificity (0.83, SD = 0.10) compared with the groups with medium (0.70, SD = 0.15) and high (0.66, SD = 0.17) proportions of abnormal cases (p < 0.001). The group with a low proportion of abnormal cases had the highest false negative rate and missed fractures one‐third more often than the groups that trained on higher proportions of abnormal cases. Conclusions: Manipulating the ratio of abnormal to normal cases in learning banks can have important educational implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Depression is a major burden for the health-care system worldwide. Most care for depression is delivered by general practitioners (GPs). We assessed the rate of true positives and negatives, and false positives and negatives in primary care when GPs make routine diagnoses of depression. Methods: We undertook a meta-analysis of 118 studies that assessed the accuracy of unassisted diagnoses of depression by GPs. 41 of these studies were included because they had a robust outcome standard of a structured or semistructured interview. Findings: 50,371 patients were pooled across 41 studies and examined. GPs correctly identified depression in 47.3% (95% CI 41.7% to 53.0%) of cases and recorded depression in their notes in 33.6% (22.4% to 45.7%). 19 studies assessed both rule-in and rule-out accuracy; from these studies, the weighted sensitivity was 50.1% (41.3% to 59.0%) and specificity was 81.3% (74.5% to 87.3%). At a rate of 21.9%, the positive predictive value was 42.0% (39.6% to 44.3%) and the negative predictive value was 85.8% (84.8% to 86.7%). This finding suggests that for every 100 unselected cases seen in primary care, there are more false positives (n=15) than either missed (n=10) or identified cases (n=10). Accuracy was improved with prospective examination over an extended period (3–12 months) rather than relying on a one-off assessment or case-note records. Interpretation: GPs can rule out depression in most people who are not depressed; however, the modest prevalence of depression in primary care means that misidentifications outnumber missed cases. Diagnosis could be improved by re-assessment of individuals who might have depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Methods: A structured interview was designed in which women, scheduled for surgery for an adnexal mass, were confronted with fictive scenarios of the different approaches. Women were asked at what probability of a false negative test result of frozen section diagnosis they would prefer frozen section diagnosis over primary radical surgery. Furthermore, the women were asked at what probability of ovarian malignancy they would prefer laparoscopy over laparotomy. Results: We interviewed 43 women. When the probability of frozen section diagnosis being false negative was set at 90%, 97% of the women preferred primary radical surgery. The mean threshold at which women switched their preference from primary radical surgery to frozen section diagnosis was at a risk of 49% on a false negative test result of frozen section diagnosis. In the choice between laparoscopy over laparotomy, the mean threshold at which the women switched their preference from laparoscopy to laparotomy was at a risk of 55% on ovarian malignancy. Conclusion: Women scheduled for surgery of an adnexal mass at low risk of ovarian malignancy, prefer frozen section diagnosis over primary radical surgery and prefer laparoscopy over laparotomy.

Abstract = {Background: This study explored with a false memory paradigm whether (1) depressed patients revealed more false memories and (2) whether more negative false than positive false recognition existed in subjects with depressive disorders. Methods: Thirty-two patients suffering from a major depressive episode (DSM-W criteria), and 30 age- and education-matched normal control subjects participated in this study. After the presentation of a list of positive, negative, and neutral association items in the learning phase, subjects were asked to give a yes/no response in the recognition phase. They were also asked to rate 81 recognition items with emotional valence scores. Results: The results revealed more negative false memories in the clinical depression group than in the normal control group; however, we did not find more negative false memories than positive ones in patients. When compared with the normal group, a more conservative response criterion for positive items was evident in patient groups. It was also found that when compared with the normal group, the subjects in the depression group perceived the positive items as less positive. Conclusions: On the basis of present results, it is suggested that depressed subjects judged the emotional information with criteria different from normal individuals, and patients' emotional memory intensity is attenuated by their mood.

Abstract = {To gain insight into memory disturbances in Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Complex PTSD), we investigated declarative memory function and medial temporal lobe activity in patients and healthy non-traumatized controls. A case-control study was performed in nine patients with Complex PTSD and nine controls. All respondents performed a declarative memory task with neutral and emotional, negative words during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Memory performance of neutral words was impaired in Complex PTSD with a relative conservation of recall of negative words. Deep encoding of later remembered negative words, as well as correct recognition of negative words and false alarms, was associated with an enhanced Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response in the left hippocampus extending into the parahippocampal gyrus of Complex PTSD patients compared with controls. Post-hoc volumetric comparisons did not reveal significant anatomical differences in the medial temporal lobe between Complex PTSD patients and controls. We conclude that in Complex PTSD preferential recall of negative words is associated with increased activation in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus during both successful and false recall. These findings support a model of an abnormally functioning hippocampus in Complex PTSD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Interleukin-1 (IL1) can contribute to pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by promoting deposition of amyloid- β in the brain. The gene encoding IL1 alpha (IL1A) has a common polymorphism in its 5’ regulatory region (rs1800587) with possible functional effects. IL1A T/T genotype has been associated with AD but the overall effect is modest and negative studies have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the IL1A rs1800587 polymorphism with AD in two independent case-control groups from Greece (Athens) and Italy (Faenza and Granarolo). Preliminary results from the ongoing sample (110 patients with sporadic AD and 130 nonpsychiatric controls) showed no association between IL1A variants and AD, however C/T heterozygotes had more severe depression in AD (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia) compared to other genotypes (F = 4.56, d.f = 1, p = 0.037) after controlling for age, illness duration and cognitive impairment (MMSE). Despite the small sample size and the possibility of a false negative finding, our preliminary data support the hypothesis the IL1A rs1800587 variants are not associated with AD. The effect of the IL1A on depressive symptomatology warrants further investigations, however the lack of a gene-dose relationship would suggest a false positive.

Abstract = {Scientists hope other laboratories will replicate their findings—any competent researcher should be able to re-do an experiment and produce the same effect, and independent replication is the benchmark of cumulative science. For good reason, we all dread publishing findings that fail to replicate. But replication failures happen for many reasons. Statistically, replication failures should happen some of the time, even for direct replications of a real effect, individual studies are samples of reality, noisy estimates of the truth. As a field, we could reduce the likelihood of false positives and enhance our ability to detect them if journals were more willing to publish both successful and failed replications. Perhaps more, importantly, we need to rethink the publishing incentives in psychology to encourage multiple replication attempts for important new findings. The goal of scientific psychology should be to obtain an, accurate estimate of the actual size of the effects we measure. The more direct replication attempts, the better the estimate of the true effect. In light of recent evidence for publication bias, investigator degrees of freedom in analysis, and the risk of false positives, any individual finding, especially one from an underpowered study, should be viewed with as much skepticism as a single failure to replicate. What the field needs are many direct replication attempts for each important finding. Only then can we be confident that an intriguing finding is more than a false positive or that a replication failure is more than a false negative.

Abstract = {Since the 1980s a large body of empirical effort has been devoted to mood-congruent memory (MCM) biases in clinical depression. Whereas there is broad, albeit not unequivocal, evidence that depressive patients retain negative-valenced memory items better than neutral material, few studies have investigated false memories in depression. In a pilot study we gathered support for both enhanced true and false memory for emotional material in depression. The present study aimed to extend these preliminary findings. In view of investigations suggesting that arousing and meaningful stimuli have facilitated access to memory, personal salience was considered a moderator for MCM. In the present study 21 depressed and 22 healthy participants were presented six false memory lists dealing with neutral, negative, and positive themes. At recognition, each item had to be appraised for its degree of valence subsequent to an old-new judgment. Pre-categorized and subjective valence did not discriminate groups. However, relative to controls, depressed patients showed both more veridical as well as false recognition for items that concurrently elicited higher salience ratings in patients. In contrast, group differences in recognition performance did not significantly affect salience ratings. Results indicate that salience modulates MCM and may account for discrepancies in the literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This study investigated the classification validity of the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) using a sample of kindergarteners (N = 177). Results indicated the cutoff scores for determining at-risk status on the DIBELS produced substantial false negative rates. Cutoff scores identifying students as at some risk produced substantial false positive rates. At both levels of risk status, the DIBELS showed low positive predictive power, but high negative predictive power, indicating it was far better at identifying students with adequate reading skills than those with inadequate reading skills. Recommendations for appropriate use of the DIBELS for reading screening and suggestions for future research are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: An appropriate bedside test for small fiber neuropathy does not exist so far. Cold hypaesthesia occurs as an early onset symptom, and the new handheld device NeuroQuick (NQ) was recently claimed to be a valid and reliable screening tool for its quantitative assessment. Aims: Comparison of the NQ with standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) in patients suffering from chronic painful dysaesthesia with and without pathological cold detection threshold (CDT). Methods: Forty-one patients with and without diabetes mellitus displaying chronic painful dysaesthesia were included (18 men, 55.8 ± 13 years). According to the German network protocol QST was performed in the body area with the severest symptoms and at the opposite side as control after thorough clinical-neurological examination. The NeuroQuick, developed as quantitative bedside testing of cold thermal perception based on the wind chill, was used subsequently. Results: DT was pathologically increased in 14 and within normal range in 27 patients; NQ values were pathological in 9 and non-pathological in 32 patients. Thus NQ obtained 7.4% false positive and 50% false negative results in detecting cold hypaesthesia, corresponding to 92.6% specificity, 50% sensitivity and a positive and negative predictive value of 78%, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the NeuroQuick is not an adequate screening device for cold hypaesthesia in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. It exhibits a high specificity but only low sensitivity in the identification of such small fiber dysfunction; a reliable and valid screening tool should necessarily provide opposite features.

Abstract = {Aims: The detection of false negative results of urine morphine test caused by adulterants was the main goal of this study. Design/setting: Screening test for urine morphine check was done by two methods of immunochromatography rapid tests and the positive results confirmation was done by thin layer chromatography TLC. Participants: Urine samples that were referred to the Military Laboratory Science Research Center were used in this study. Intervention: Sodium chloride, vinegar, lemon juice, nitrites, hydrogen peroxide, bleach, and pH and gravity effects were consider as common adulterants in the urine morphine check. Measurements: Urine was checked for the presence and absence of the above-mentioned adulterants in urine samples. Finding: The study data showed that test performance using the two methods of analysis, using a presence and absence threshold amount of morphine (300 ng/ml), showed a 100% sensitivity for revealing false negative results due to interference with adulterants. Conclusion: Urine morphine test in double format, with and without threshold amount of morphine, can reveal adulterant interference and prevent false negative reporting. This strategy will be effective in detecting false negatives in urine samples contaminated with adulterants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Remembering negative events can stimulate high levels of false memory, relative to remembering neutral events. In experiments in which the emotional valence of encoded materials was manipulated with their arousal levels controlled, valence produced a continuum of memory falsification. Falsification was highest for negative materials, intermediate for neutral materials, and lowest for positive materials. Conjoint-recognition analysis produced a simple process-level explanation: As one progresses from positive to neutral to negative valence, false memory increases because (a) the perceived meaning resemblance between false and true items increases and (b) subjects are less able to use verbatim memories of true items to suppress errors.

Abstract = {Despite a large body of false memory research, little has addressed the potential influence of an event's emotional content on susceptibility to false recollections. The Paradoxical Negative Emotion (PNE) hypothesis predicts that negative emotion generally facilitates memory but also heightens susceptibility to false memories. Participants were asked whether they could recall 20 "widely publicised" public events (half fictitious) ranging in emotional valence, with or without visual cues. Participants recalled a greater number of true negative events (M = 3.31/5) than true positive (M = 2.61/5) events. Nearly everyone (95%) came to recall at least one false event (M = 2.15 false events recalled). Further, more than twice as many participants recalled any false negative (90%) compared to false positive (41.7%) events. Negative events, in general, were associated with more detailed memories and false negative event memories were more detailed than false positive event memories. Higher dissociation scores were associated with false recollections of negative events, specifically. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The performance of 40 children with complicated mild to severe traumatic brain injury on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; Wechsler, 2003) was compared with that of 40 demographically matched healthy controls. Of the four WISC-IV factor index scores, only Processing Speed yielded a statistically significant group difference (p < .001) as well as a statistically significant negative correlation with length of coma (p < .01). Logistic regression, using Processing Speed to classify individual children, yielded a sensitivity of 72.50% and a specificity of 62.50%, with false positive and false negative rates both exceeding 30%. We conclude that Processing Speed has acceptable criterion validity in the evaluation of children with complicated mild to severe traumatic brain injury but that the WISC-IV should be supplemented with other measures to assure sufficient accuracy in the diagnostic process.

Abstract = {Several association studies support the hypothesis that genetic variants can modify the influence of environmental factors on behavioral outcomes, i.e., G × E interaction. The case-control design used in these studies is powerful, but population stratification with respect to allele frequencies can give rise to false positive or false negative associations. Stratification with respect to the environmental factors can lead to false positives or false negatives with respect to environmental main effects and G × E interaction effects as well. Here we present a model based on Fulker et al. (1999) and Purcell (2002) for the study of G × E interaction in family-based association designs, in which the effects of stratification can be controlled. Simulations illustrate the power to detect genetic and environmental main effects, and G × E interaction effects for the sib pair design. The power to detect interaction was studied in eight different situations, both with and without the presence of population stratification, and for categorical and continuous environmental factors. Results show that the power to detect genetic and environmental main effects, and G × E interaction effects, depends on the allele frequencies and the distribution of the environmental moderator. Admixture effects of realistic effect size lead only to very small stratification effects in the G × E component, so impractically large numbers of sib pairs are required to detect such stratification.

Abstract = {Introduction: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder characterized by persistent, excessive worrying. Even if GAD's ill consequences on health and quality of life are well documented, this disorder is still difficult to identify in primary care. The worry and anxiety questionnaire (WAQ) is a questionnaire assessing specific GAD symptoms, as defined by the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders—4th ed. (DSM-IV). Objectives: This study aimed at assessing the capacity of the French version of the WAQ's to identify individuals with GAD in a sample of individuals reporting a certain level of anxiety. A second objective was to identify which of its items better distinguish individuals with GAD from those without. According to these results, different scoring algorithms have been developed and their effect on the WAQ's sensitivity and specificity indicators has been explored. Design of the study: The sample was drawn from a mother study in which 1110 health-care users completed questionnaires while waiting for a medical consultation with a family physician. Of those, a subsample of 219 individuals reported anxiety symptoms typical of GAD, as assessed by the WAQ. Among those who agreed to participate in the study's second phase (n = 176), 100 were randomly selected and invited within one to three months to a clinical interview assessing their anxiety symptoms more thoroughly. Thirty-three individuals accepted and thus formed the present sample. The clinical interview was the anxiety disorders interview schedule (ADIS). The ADIS is a semi-structured diagnostic interview following the DSM-IV criteria. It assesses all anxiety disorders and includes screening questions on mood, substance use and psychotic disorders. Participants also completed the WAQ for a second time at the time of the interview. Results: Nineteen individuals received a diagnosis of GAD after completing the ADIS while 13 did not. Sixteen of the 19 individuals with GAD were correctly identified with the WAQ, compared to eight out of 13 for individuals without GAD. Sensitivity of the WAQ's actual scoring algorithm is thus of 84.2% and its specificity of 61.5%. The number of false negatives produced by the WAQ in this sample (3/19, 15.8%) was lower than the number of false positives (5/13, 38.5%). Positive and negative predictive power is thus of 76.2% and 72.7%, respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses indicated that the most useful items to identify individuals with GAD were those assessing the presence of excessive worrying, the number of days disturbed by worries, the degree with which worries interfere with daily functioning and the degree of control over worries. Knowing an individual's outcome on the WAQ increases the probability of correctly identifying an individual with or without GAD by 8.5 times compared to mere chance. A new scoring algorithm, where the cut-off score on the excessive worrying item was increased by one unit, considerably improves the WAQ's specificity (84.6%), without altering its sensitivity by much (78.9%). This new scoring algorithm thus increases the probability of correctly identifying individuals with and without GAD to 20.6 times (again compared to chance). Conclusion: The WAQ is thus a useful instrument in screening GAD, even in a sample of anxious individuals. Its original scoring algorithm shows excellent sensitivity, a valued quality in an instrument used for screening. On the other hand, it is possible to increase the specificity of the WAQ by raising the cut-off point on the excessive worrying item, making the instrument useful as a diagnostic aid or as a screening questionnaire for GAD, in particular among a sample displaying anxiety. This questionnaire is thus an easy-to-complete and adaptable instrument that can be used by family physicians to help them identifying individuals with GAD.

Abstract = {Losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q are deemed correlated with diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, higher chemosensitivity and better prognosis. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the usefulness of these correlations in daily clinical practice. The rates of deletions relative to histology (WHO classifications) were extracted from 33 studies, including 2666 patients. The 1p deletions and 1p19q codeletion mean rates were respectively 65.4 and 63.3% in oligodendrogliomas, 28.7 and 21.6% in oligoastrocytomas, 13.2 and 7.5% in astrocytomas, 11.6 and 2.9% in glioblastomas. The presence of 1p deletion and 1p19q codeletion were strongly correlated with the histological diagnosis corresponding to oligodendroglioma. Calculation of specificity, sensitivity, predictive positive values and false negative rates suggests that presence of deletion 1p or codeletion represents a strong argument in favor of the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. However, considering the high false negative rate, absence of such deletions does not rule out the diagnosis. In grade 3 oligodendroglial tumors, the probability of responding to chemotherapy, and the duration of response, were higher when codeletions were present. This suggests that, in these tumors, the presence of codeletion is a strong argument in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy should not be systematically excluded when codeletions are absent, as the chances of response are about 33% in this situation. Data concerning low-grade gliomas were more controversial. Oligodendroglial tumors with 1p deletion or 1p19q codeletion seemed to have a better prognosis, as five-year survival rates were 50% higher than in tumors without deletion. This might be explained by the correlation between 1p deletion and other identified prognosis factors: (1) higher chemosensitivity, (2) tumor location more frequently in the frontal lobe, leading to better resection and lower risk of neurological deficit, (3) slower growth rate, (4) higher risk of epilepsy, leading to an early detection.

Abstract = {Objective: To obtain quality-of-life (QOL) valuations associated with mammography screening and breast cancer treatment that are suitable for use in cost-effectiveness analyses. Methods: Subjects comprised 131 women (age range 50-79 years) randomly sampled from a breast cancer screening program. In an in-person or telephone interview, women rated the QOL impact of 14 clinical scenarios (ranging from mammography to end-of-life care for breast cancer) using a visual analogue scale anchored by death (0) and perfect health/quality of life (100). Results: Women rated the scenarios describing true negative results, false positive results, and routine screening mammography at 80 or above on a scale of 0-100, suggesting that they perceive these states as being close to perfect health. They rated adjuvant chemotherapy (39.7; range 10-90), palliation/end-of-life care (35.8; range 0-100), and recurrence at 1 year (33.0; range 0-95) the lowest, suggesting that these health states are perceived as compromised. Women rated receiving news of a breast cancer diagnosis (true positive) (45.7; range 5-100) and receiving delayed news of a breast cancer diagnosis (false negative) (48.5; range 5-100) as being comparable to undergoing mastectomy (48.3; range 10-100) and radiation therapy (46.2; range 5-100) for breast cancer. Conclusions: These data can be used to update cost analyses of mammography screening that wish to take into account the QOL impact of screening.

Abstract = {There is disagreement in the literature about whether a "positivity effect" in memory performance exists in older adults. To assess the generalizability of the effect, the authors examined memory for autobiographical, picture, and word information in a group of younger (17-29 years old) and older (60-84 years old) adults. For the autobiographical memory task, the authors asked participants to produce 4 positive, 4 negative, and 4 neutral recent autobiographical memories and to recall these a week later. For the picture and word tasks, participants studied photos or words of different valences (positive, negative, neutral) and later remembered them on a free-recall test. The authors found significant correlations in memory performance, across task material, for recall of both positive and neutral valence autobiographical events, pictures, and words. When the authors examined accurate memories, they failed to find consistent evidence, across the different types of material, of a positivity effect in either age group. However, the false memory findings offer more consistent support for a positivity effect in older adults. During recall of all 3 types of material, older participants recalled more false positive than false negative memories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background and objective: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report quality of care for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with the intention of rewarding superior performing hospitals. The aim of the study was to compare identification of superior hospitals for providing financial rewards using 2 different scoring systems: a latent score that weights individual clinical performance measures according to how well each discriminated hospital quality and a raw sum score (the system adopted by CMS). Methods: This observational cohort study used 2761 acute care hospitals in the United States reporting AMI clinical performance measures, 3271 reporting CHF measures, and 3714 hospitals reporting CAP measures. For each clinical condition, the main outcome measures included the average raw sum score, the latent score estimated from an item response theory (IRT) model, and the percentage of false negative superior designations made on the basis of raw sum scores relative to latent scores. Results: The average raw sum score was highest for AMI (88.8%) and lower for CHF (73.1%) and CAP (76.3%). AMI measures were equally nondiscriminating of hospital quality; hospital discharge instruction was most discriminating of CHF quality; pneumococcal vaccination was most discriminating of CAP quality. False negative rates varied 2-fold: AMI (10%), CHF (16%), and CAP (24%). Conclusions: Neither the AMI raw sum score nor latent score discriminates hospital quality due to ceiling effects. Current methods for aggregating measures result in different hospital superior designations than those based on the latent score. Organizations that financially reward hospitals on the basis of such scores need to assess predictive validity of scores and determine a minimum level of classification accuracy.

Random effect logistic models were used to estimate risk adjustment models for 5 outcomes: pressure ulcers for high and low risk patients, physical restraints, and pain for long- and short-stay patients. These models were used to create 5 QMs with extended risk adjustment, enhanced QMs (EQMs). The EQMs were compared with the corresponding QMs. Subjects: All (17,469) nursing homes that reported MDS data in the period 2001-2005, and their 9.6 million residents. Measures: QMs were compared with EQMs for all nursing homes in terms of agreement on outlier identification: Kappa, false positive and false negative error rates. Results: Kappa values ranged from 0.63 to 0.90. False positive and negative error rates ranged from 8% to 37%. Agreement between QMs and EQMs was better on high quality rather than on low quality. Conclusions: More extensive risk adjustment changes quality ranking of nursing homes and should be considered as potential improvement to the current QMs. Other methodological issues related to construction of the QMs should also be investigated to determine if they are important in the context of nursing home care.

Abstract = {Multiple hypotheses testing is concerned with appropriately controlling the rate of false positives, false negatives or both when testing several hypotheses simultaneously. Nowadays, the common approach to testing multiple hypotheses calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses referred to as the false discovery rate (FDR) or suitable measures based on the positive false discovery rate (pFDR). In this paper, we consider the problem of determining levels that both false positives and false negatives can be controlled simultaneously. As our risk function, we use the expected value of the maximum between the proportions of false positives and false negatives, with the expectation being taken conditional on the event that at least one hypothesis is rejected and one is accepted, referred to as hybrid error rate (HER). We then develop, based on HER, an analog of p-value termed as h-value to test the individual hypotheses. The use of the new procedure is illustrated using the well-known public data set by Golub et al. [Molecular classification of cancer: class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring, Science 386 (1999) 531-537] with Affymetrix arrays of patients with acute lymphoic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia.

Abstract = {HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent, especially in regions like South Africa where HIV prevalence is high but access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) is limited. The incidence of HIV dementia (HAD) has been halved with the use of ART, but the prevalence remains high. Appropriate brief screening tools to screen for HAD are needed in order to facilitate treatment initiation. The validity of the International HIV Dementia Scale has not been established in a region where infection with HIV clade C is predominant. The International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) was administered together with a detailed neuropsychological test battery to 96 HIV-positive individuals who had not received ART and who were attending primary care HIV clinics. The validity of the IHDS was established using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. HIV-positive individuals displayed greater impairment when compared to HIV-negative controls on the IHDS and a range of neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological tests discriminated well across HAND categories for HIV-positive individuals. In ROC analysis, the IHDS showed an area under the curve of 0.64, with a sensitivity of 45% and specificity of 79% at a cutoff score of 10. Individuals with HAD, who screened negative on the IHDS, performed poorly on some tests of executive function. These data suggest that the IHDS may have limitations as a tool to screen for HAD in South Africans infected with HIV. Variable performance in neuropsychological testing may account for false negative screens. The inclusion of brief tests of executive function in a screening battery should be considered.

Abstract = {Single subject fMRI has proved to be a useful tool for mapping functional areas in clinical procedures such as tumor resection. Using fMRI data, clinicians assess the risk, plan and execute such procedures based on thresholded statistical maps. However, because current thresholding methods were developed mainly in the context of cognitive neuroscience group studies, most single subject fMRI maps are thresholded manually to satisfy specific criteria related to single subject analyzes. Here, we propose a new adaptive thresholding method which combines Gamma-Gaussian mixture modeling with topological thresholding to improve cluster delineation. In a series of simulations we show that by adapting to the signal and noise properties, the new method performs well in terms of total number of errors but also in terms of the trade-off between false negative and positive cluster error rates. Similarly, simulations show that adaptive thresholding performs better than fixed thresholding in terms of over and underestimation of the true activation border (i.e., higher spatial accuracy). Finally, through simulations and a motor test–retest study on 10 volunteer subjects, we show that adaptive thresholding improves reliability, mainly by accounting for the global signal variance. This in turn increases the likelihood that the true activation pattern can be determined offering an automatic yet flexible way to threshold single subject fMRI maps.

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of the Neurological Depressive Disorders Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) and the depression component of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS-D) for identifying depression and suicide risk in adults with epilepsy. Methods: A total of 147 (87 female [59%]) outpatients attending a tertiary epilepsy center in Sydney Australia completed the NDDI-E and HADS-D. They then completed the depression and suicide sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MINI) with a clinician blind to symptom measure scores. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was performed for the clinical cutoff scores for depression on the NDDI-E ≥15 and HADS-D ≥ 8 to identify MINI-determined depression and suicidality. Results: The NDDI-E indicated strong sensitivity (84%) and acceptable specificity (78%), whereas the HADS-D had poor sensitivity (42%) but good specificity (97%) for identifying depression. For identifying suicide risk, the NDDI-E indicated strong sensitivity (81%) and reasonable specificity (66%), whereas the HADS-D had poor sensitivity (43%) but acceptable specificity (90%). Area under the curve comparisons for these measures were not significant. Conclusion: In clinical practice, it is essential that screening measures have the highest possible sensitivity values to limit the chances of false-negative results. In accordance with these guidelines, the NDDI-E was a superior screening measure compared with the HADS-D. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the NDDI-E for identifying both major and minor depression and serious suicide risk. The poor sensitivity of the HADS-D suggests that it should not be used as a screen for depression or suicidality in adults with epilepsy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Users of peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks risk the inadvertent disclosure of personal health information (PHI). In addition to potentially causing harm to the affected individuals, this can heighten the risk of data breaches for health information custodians. Automated PHI detection tools that crawl the P2P networks can identify PHI and alert custodians. While there has been previous work on the detection of personal information in electronic health records, there has been a dearth of research on the automated detection of PHI in heterogeneous user files. Objective: To build a system that accurately detects PHI in files sent through P2P file-sharing networks. The system, which we call P2P Watch, uses a pipeline of text processing techniques to automatically detect PHI in files exchanged through P2P networks. P2P Watch processes unstructured texts regardless of the file format, document type, and content. Methods: We developed P2P Watch to extract and analyze PHI in text files exchanged on P2P networks. We labeled texts as PHI if they contained identifiable information about a person (eg, name and date of birth) and specifics of the person’s health (eg, diagnosis, prescriptions, and medical procedures). We evaluated the system’s performance through its efficiency and effectiveness on 3924 files gathered from three P2P networks. Results: P2P Watch successfully processed 3924 P2P files of unknown content. A manual examination of 1578 randomly selected files marked by the system as non-PHI confirmed that these files indeed did not contain PHI, making the false-negative detection rate equal to zero. Of 57 files marked by the system as PHI, all contained both personally identifiable information and health information: 11 files were PHI disclosures, and 46 files contained organizational materials such as unfilled insurance forms, job applications by medical professionals, and essays. Conclusions: PHI can be successfully detected in free-form textual files exchanged through P2P networks. Once the files with PHI are detected, affected individuals or data custodians can be alerted to take remedial action. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The study investigated current police practices employed to identify those with a mental illness in police custody, and to evaluate the predictive utility of the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS) and the Jail Screening Assessment Tool (JSAT). One hundred and fifty detainees were recruited from two police stations in Melbourne, Australia. Measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR, BJMHS and JSAT. Axis-I disorders were compared with police decisions regarding identification of mental illness based on their usual practices. Participants were classified as requiring referral for further mental health evaluation according to the screening tools. Results indicated that current police practices produced high false negatives, with many of those experiencing mental illness not identified. There was no significant difference in performance between BJMHS (AUC = 0.722) and JSAT (AUC = 0.779) in identifying those with a serious mental illness (p = 0.109). However, JSAT performed significantly better at identifying any Axis-I disorder, excluding substance use disorders, as compared with BJMHS (AUC = 0.815, vs AUC = 0.729; p = 0.018). Given the high prevalence of mental illness among detainees, there is a pressing need to introduce standardised screening tools for mental illness in police custody. This can assist the police in managing detainees appropriately and securing mental health services as required. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Acute stroke is a time-and expertise-critical emergency. An immediate and correct diagnosis by emergency medical services (EMS) in the pre hospital phase and patient transfer to the nearest adequate hospital with a stroke unit is required for early treatment of acute stroke. Patients and methods: We evaluated all patients who were admitted by the EMS of Münster to one of the two stroke units in the town between October 2008 and December 2010 with a diagnosis of acute stroke. Furthermore all patients were critically analyzed who were admitted without a diagnosis of acute stroke by the EMS but nonetheless had a stroke and the correct diagnosis was not found until examination in the neurological department. Results: We analyzed 615 patients who we readmitted to the stroke units with the diagnosis of acute stroke. In 561 cases (91%) this diagnosis could be confirmed, but in 54 patients (9%) the diagnosis by the EMS was incorrect. Epileptic seizure was the most frequent-positive diagnosis in this group of patients (39%; n = 21). Although the acute symptoms were caused by a stroke, the correct diagnosis was not defined by the EMS in 127 patients. This accounted for 18% of all patients admitted to the emergency departments by the EMS where ultimately a stroke was diagnosed. In 24% of these cases (n = 30) the emergency doctor missed the correct diagnosis, which meant 4% of all patients admitted by the EMS, finally diagnosed with an acute stroke. In all other cases in the group with a false-negative diagnosis (76% or 97 patients) an emergency doctor was not involved in the referral by the EMS. Conclusion: Emergency medical services should be involved in the establishment of admission programs for acute stroke patients to provide the fastest means of transportation to a stroke unit. Coma, symptoms of posterior cerebral circulation and epileptic seizures cause difficulties in ensuring an immediate and correct diagnosis. Sending an emergency doctor to the scene increases diagnostic certainty which is essential to initiate early treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Phosphomannomutase 2 deficiency (PMM2- CDG) patients may present as mild phenotypes, with the cerebellum frequently involved. In those cases, false-negative results in screening may occur when applying conventional biochemical procedures. Our aim was to report two patients with a diagnosis of PMM2-CDG presenting with mild clinical phenotype. Patient 1—at 9 months of age, she presented with just psychomotor delay, tremor, hypotonia, and slight lipodystrophy. Patient 2 —she presented at 8 months of age with psychomotor delay, hand stereotypes, hypotonia, convergent bilateral strabismus, and tremor but no . Routine biochemical parameters including blood count, clotting factors, proteins, and thyroid hormone were normal in both cases. Cranial MRI evidenced mild cerebellar atrophy with moderate vermis hypoplasia. In case 1, sialotransferrin pattern showed very slightly increased disialotransferrin with no asialotransferrin, and in case 2, the transferrin pattern was impaired in the first study but nearly normal in the second. Nevertheless, in all the samples, quantification of the patterns obtained by capillary zone electrophoresis analysis gave results out of the control range. High residual PMM2 activity was observed in both cases and the genetic analysis showed that patient 1 was heterozygous for c.722G > C (p.C241S) and c.368G > A (p.R123Q) mutations, and patient 2 showed the c.722G > C and the c.470T > C (p. F157S) mutations in the PMM2 gene. We would like to stress the importance of the use of sensitive semiquantitative methods of screening for CDG in order to achieve early identification of patients with mild phenotypes. Intentional tremor was an atypical but remarkable clinical feature in both cases, and the global cerebellar atrophy with vermis hypoplasia reinforced the early clinical suspicion of a PMM2-CDG disease.

Abstract = {Comments on an article, "Predicting the development of schizophrenia in high-risk populations: systematic review of the predictive validity of prodromal criteria" by J. Chuma & P. Mahadun (2011). Chuma & Mahadun report on a much needed and topical meta analysis of prospective studies investigating the predictive validity of prodromal criteria in schizophrenia. The potential importance of early identification and treatment cannot be underestimated. The authors should be congratulated for helping clarify whether the identification component is currently worthwhile. I have no doubt that this paper is generally well conducted and for the 'ultra-high-risk strategy' sample size reasonable but I am afraid I cannot agree with their interpretation of results. In particular, they conclude that that both ultra-high-risk and basic-symptoms criteria are valid and useful tools in predicting the future development of schizophrenia among the 'at-risk population', and that ultra-high-risk criteria were able to 'correctly predict schizophrenia', while being able to 'exclude this condition with some certainty'. appreciate that many might find these statistical terms confusing. Previously, I have proposed a simple adjustment of false positives and false negatives per every 100 patients seen, which I called real-world interpretation/yield. So, for every 100 individuals thought to be at risk and subject to ultra-high-risk criteria, 17 would be correctly classified as converters to schizophrenia and 4 would be missed; and 53 would be correctly classified as non-converters but 26 would be falsely identified. In effect, there would be six times as many false positives as false negatives. I therefore ask the authors to reconsider whether these approaches are entirely valid for both rule-in and rule-out purposes when the data suggest mainly the latter.

Abstract = {Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been implicated in brain mechanisms related to motivation, reward, and drug addiction. Successful identification of these neurons in vitro has historically depended upon the expression of a hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) and immunohistochemical demonstration of the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for DA synthesis. Recent findings suggest that electrophysiological criteria may be insufficient for distinguishing DA neurons from non-DA neurons in the VTA. In this study, we sought to determine factors that could potentially account for the apparent discrepancies in the literature regarding DA neuron identification in the rodent brain slice preparation. We found that confirmed DA neurons from the lateral VTA generally displayed a larger amplitude Ih relative to DA neurons located in the medial VTA. Measurement of a large amplitude Ih (>100 pA) consistently indicated a dopaminergic phenotype, but non-dopamine neurons also can have Ih current. The data also showed that immunohistochemical TH labeling of DA neurons can render false negative results after relatively long duration (>15 min) whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We conclude that whole-cell patch clamp recording in combination with immunohistochemical detection of TH expression can guarantee positive but not negative DA identification in the VTA.

Abstract = {One undeniable risk of allowing blood donation by men who have sex with men is a false-negative result on HIV testing, i.e., the occurrence of a negative result when the donor is, in fact, infected with HIV. This consideration applies to all prospective donors, including heterosexual people and other individuals, who may have been judged to be risk-free on the basis of an administered questionnaire. Another concern is that gay men who believe they are in stable, long-term monogamous relationships could be deceived by their partners about the latter’s monogamy. Although this concern cannot be discounted, it is just as relevant for both heterosexual donors and men who have sex with men. Innovations in HIV testing, especially the increased availability of rapid testing, will result in more men who have sex with men being tested, learning their HIV status, reducing risky behavior and receiving treatment earlier. This, in turn, would benefit blood safety—should men who have sex with men be allowed to donate—because they would learn about their HIV status and that of their partners through a mechanism outside the blood system. The risk can be measured in terms of the number of people potentially infected by donated blood relative to the total number of people who donate;4 zero risk is, of course, impossible to attain.

Abstract = {Objective: There are few data concerning a clear relationship between the clinical effect of paroxetine and plasma drug concentrations, although therapeutic ranges have been established for some tricyclic antidepressants. Methods: In this study, 120 patients with major depressive disorders were treated with 10–40 mg/day of paroxetine for 6 weeks, and a total of 89 patients completed the protocol. A clinical evaluation using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was performed at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Results: Significant correlations were found between the plasma concentrations of paroxetine and the percentage improvement in the total MADRS scores (r = −0.282, p < 0.01) and the final MADRS scores at 6 weeks (r = 0.268, p < 0.05). The conventional receiver-operating- characteristic curve showed the fraction of true positive results and false negative results for various cut-off levels of paroxetine concentration for response and remission. The thresholds for both response and remission that gave the maximal sensitivity and specificity for paroxetine concentrations were 64.2 ng/ml. Conclusions: These results suggest that plasma paroxetine concentrations are negatively associated with improvement and that response occurs at the upper threshold of 64.2 ng/ml of paroxetine. These findings should be replicated with a larger patient sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {A valid 1 item screen (‘‘In the past 12 months, have you ever had an issue with your gambling?’’) is potentially important in both a primary care setting and in research applications where an extended screen is not practical or affordable. Prior research by Thomas et al. (A one item screening tool for problem gambling for use in primary care settings, Unpublished Manuscript, Monash University, 2010) and Thomas et al. (MJA 189(3):135–136, 2008) found that the 1 item screen provided acceptable performance when compared to the 9-item Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI, Ferris and Wynne in The Canadian problem gambling Index: Final report, Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 2001). The current study sought to replicate these findings in a different geographic area. Data were collected from a telephone survey of 1,292 respondents in Queensland. Results from the phone survey showed a very high proportion of false negatives (79%), indicating that approximately 4/5 of positively identified problem gamblers from the PGSI refused to admit to having any ‘‘issues with (their) gambling’’ in the last 12 months. Further investigation using Rasch analysis (Andrich in Medical Care, 42(1):7–16, 2004) revealed that while the internal construct validity of the PGSI was good, the 1 item screen was ineffective as an indicator of those who are presently at risk for problem gambling. One possible explanation for the discrepancy with past results is that the present study employed the qualifier of ‘‘In the past 12 months’’ to match with the questions on the PGSI, whereas the prior research excluded this timeframe limit. Nevertheless, the current study casts doubt on the ability or willingness of people with severe gambling problems to self-diagnose their behavior as problematic.

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the comments made by E. M. Hill-Burns et al. (see record [rid]2011-18070-018[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2011-07987-014[/rid]). Direct replication is especially challenging in epidemiological studies as scientific conditions often vary and alternative explanations can explain the lack of consistency between studies. Herein, we consider at least three possible explanations that might explain Hill-Burns et al.'s failure to replicate our findings. First, smoking or population-stratification might confound the CYP1A2–PD associations and coffee–CYP1A2 interactions observed in our study. Second, lack of replication could be due to true heterogeneity between the studies owing to differences in study populations and methods for ascertaining exposures. Third, the lack of replication could result from false-positive or false-negative findings. Hill-Burns et al. report is false-negative because of the study population and exposure ascertainment methods used in the NGRC consortium. Additional replication studies are warranted given the importance of identifying biological explanations for the inverse association between caffeine and Parkinson's disease.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by M. Schöll et al. (see record [rid]2012-20786-009[/rid]). The authors draw attention to a limitation of Aβ imaging in early onset familial AD (eoFAD). Using PET imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), they showed that 2 carriers of the E693G substitution in the APP gene (the “Arctic mutation” or APParc), which is fully penetrant for eoFAD, lacked detectable PiB retention. This was distinct from the positive PiB pattern seen in 2 persons carrying other eoFAD mutations and in 7 patients with sporadic AD, but was similar to the negative PiB scans seen in 5 noncarriers from families with the APParc mutation and 7 healthy controls. Interpreting a negative result is a perilous endeavor. As the authors attest, there are various explanations for the lack of PiB binding in these subjects, including affinity of PiB for other moieties not present in the pathology associated with APParc. The report brings attention to a limitation of Aβ imaging— the potential for false-negative scans due to atypical Aβ assembly structure or plaque organization. In demonstrating the lack of concordance between PiB signal and other biomarkers in a subset of persons with AD, the authors have underscored the diversity of the pathology that can underlie the “Alzheimer diseases,” the full spectrum of which we must better comprehend if we are going to diagnose and treat them optimally.

The author requests clarification of methods relating to recruitment of participants for our study and evaluation of the predictive accuracy in the independent validation cohort. Patients were prospectively recruited to the study from 3 single centers and 3 cooperative research groups and individually consented to an optional research needle biopsy of their newly diagnosed breast cancer prior to initiation of chemotherapy that was preoperative (neo-adjuvant) in all of the discovery cohort and 183 of 198 patients in the validation cohort. The ROC is a meaningful tool for describing the range of trade-offs between false-positive and false-negative predictions that can be achieved by selecting any threshold within continuous, quantitative results. The diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) are well-characterized indicators of diagnostic test performance and differentiation potential (discrimination) between 2 alternative outcomes and have a clear clinical interpretation. The DOR is defined as the ratio DLR /DLR− and provides the odds for relapse of those predicted as treatment insensitive vs treatment sensitive.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by M. Marinoni et al. (see record [rid]2011-01729-011[/rid]). It is not clear in the article why the use of Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography preceded a clinical examination for suspected brain death (BD). The study design and methodology also raises some important concerns. The definition of hypotension used by the authors during the TCD examination is questionable. The authors report that there were no false positives in this series, but it is not clear what did they use as a standard to compare TCD in order to report false positivity? The authors report false-negative TCD patterns in five patients, four of which had decompressive craniotomy. This finding is not surprising or unexpected, because large skull defects including decompressive craniectomy interfere with the development of intracranial hypertension. The authors report TCD pattern of BD in a patient treated with extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and intra-aortic balloon pump where they emphasize the noise in the background of the Doppler spectrum due to the ECLS device. However, curiously, the TCD waveform does not show the patterns and characteristics of intra-aortic balloon pump. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Failure is defined as committing a homicide or attempted homicide or being the victim of a homicide or an attempted homicide. These are very rare events in the population of individuals studied, which can make these outcomes extremely difficult to forecast accurately. Building in the relative costs of false positives and false negatives, machine learning procedures are applied to construct useful forecasts. The central question addressed is what role race should play as a predictor when as an empirical matter the majority of perpetrators and victims are young, African American, males.

Abstract = {This paper presents a method for improved automatic delineation of dendrites and spines from three-dimensional (3-D) images of neurons acquired by confocal or multi-photon fluorescence microscopy. The core advance presented here is a direct grayscale skeletonization algorithm that is constrained by a structural complexity penalty using the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and additional neuroanatomy-specific constraints. The 3-D skeleton is extracted directly from the grayscale image data, avoiding errors introduced by image binarization. The MDL method achieves a practical tradeoff between the complexity of the skeleton and its coverage of the fluorescence signal. Additional advances include the use of 3-D spline smoothing of dendrites to improve spine detection, and graph-theoretic algorithms to explore and extract the dendritic structure from the grayscale skeleton using an intensity-weighted minimum spanning tree (IWMST) algorithm. This algorithm was evaluated on 30 datasets organized in 8 groups from multiple laboratories. Spines were detected with false negative rates less than 10% on most datasets (the average is 7.1%), and the average false positive rate was 11.8%. The software is available in open source form.

Abstract = {The statistical concept of accuracy has never been applied to verify the history data collected on seizure disorders by open format interview. We compared patients’/witnesses’ descriptions of epileptic seizures with videotaped seizure characteristics and analyzed the accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), false-positive rate (FPR), and false-negative rate (FNR) of various components of the semiology in patients with partial epilepsy. Language disturbances, complex automatisms, and autonomic signs have high ACC and intermediate FNRs. This means that these manifestations are most obvious to the witness/patient and, therefore, are memorized easily. Dystonic posturing and upper limb automatisms have the highest FNRs, leading to low ACC. These are very subtle signs, not vigorous enough to be paid attention to, but their predictive value in partial epilepsy syndromes is relatively high. We believe these signs need to be directly sought in the interview, because often the patient/witness pays limited attention to them. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To compare examples of three styles of psychiatric interviews for youth: the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) (“respondent-based”), the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) (“interviewer-based”), and the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) (“expert judgment”). Method: Roughly equal numbers of males and females of white and African American ethnicity, aged 9 to 12 and 13 to 16 years, were recruited from primary care pediatric clinics. Participants (N = 646) were randomly assigned to receive two of the three interviews, in counterbalanced order. Five modules were used: any depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. At two sessions about 1 week apart, parent and child completed one of two interviews plus five screening questionnaires. Results: When interviewed with the DAWBA, 17.7% of youth had one or more diagnoses, compared with 47.1% (DISC) and 32.4% (CAPA). The excess of DISC diagnoses was accounted for by specific phobias. Agreement between interview pairs was 0.13 to 0.48 for DAWBA-DISC comparisons, 0.21 to 0.61 for DISC-CAPA comparisons, and 0.23 to 0.48 for CAPA-DAWBA comparisons. DAWBA-only cases were associated with higher parent-report questionnaire scores than DISC/DAWBA cases, but equivalent child-report scores. Conclusions: The DAWBA is shorter and cases were probably more severe, making it a good choice for clinical trials, but the user cannot examine the data in detail. The DISC and CAPA are similar in length and training needs. Either would be a better choice where false-negative results must be avoided, as in case-control genetic studies, or when researchers need to study individual symptoms in detail.

Abstract = {Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) deficiency causes encephalomyopathies, of which there are four major categories: (1) neonatal encephalopathy with lactic acidosis; (2) an early infantile form,which (3) at times resembles Leigh syndrome; and (4) a later-onset form. Long-term clinical and radiological follow-up is still incompletely elucidated. We report a 12-year-old-male with intermittent-relapsing PDHC deficiency who presented with three typical acute episodes of metabolic decompensation over 7 years. Neuroimaging showed reversible signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, inferior olivary nuclei, periaqueductal grey matter, and dentate nuclei, with evidence of lactate on magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Molecular analysis of PDH1A revealed a novel hemizygous c.1045G > Amutation, predicting a p.A349T missense mutation. He was treated with thiamine supplementation and, while on this regimen, he experienced several intercurrent febrile episodes without neurological compromise. This case report stresses the importance of performing neuroimaging during acute clinical episodes because brain lesions in PDHC deficiency may be transient and reversible, and false-negative results may mislead the diagnosis and delay the treatment.

Abstract = {This study used criterion groups validation to determine the accuracy of the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) in detecting malingered pain-related disability (MPRD) across a range of cutoffs in chronic pain patients undergoing psychological evaluation (n = 604). Data from patients with traumatic brain injury (n = 45) and dementia (n = 59) are presented for comparison. TOMM scores decreased and failure rates increased as a function of greater external evidence of intentional under-performance. The TOMM detected from 37.5% to 60.2% of MPRD patients, depending on the cutoff. False positive (FP) error rates ranged from 0% to 5.1%. Accuracy data for Trial 1 are also reported. In chronic pain the original cutoffs produced no FP errors but were associated with high false negative error rates. Higher cutoffs increased sensitivity without adversely affecting specificity. The relevance of these findings to research and clinical practice is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The brain is the body’s largest energy consumer, even in the absence of demanding tasks. Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.

Abstract = {Sports-related concussions are complex injuries with biomechanical and biochemical etiology that present with central and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Current methods for assessing concussions and basing return-to-play decisions rely on symptom resolution, rating scales, and neuropsychological testing, all of which are indirect measures of injury severity and detect functional capabilities but do not directly measure injury location or severity. In addition, these downstream measures are susceptible to false negatives because compensatory mechanism, such as unmasking and redundancies in brain circuitry can return functional capabilities before injury resolution. The multifactorial nature of concussion necessitates rapid, inexpensive, and easily applied multimodal analysis methods that can offer greater sensitivity and specificity. This article discusses how new approaches utilizing electrophysiology (e.g., QEEG, ERP, ECG, HRV), quantified balance measures, and biochemistry are necessary to advance the science of concussion assessment, treatment, recovery projections, and return-to-play decisions. These additional assessment tools offer a more direct window into the severity and location of the injury, real-time measures of brain function, and the ability to measure the multiple body systems negatively affected by concussion.

Abstract = {Background: For early detection of autism, it is difficult to maintain an efficient level of sensitivity and specificity based on observational data from a single screening. The Extraction and Refinement (E&R) Strategy utilizes a public children’s health surveillance program to produce maximum efficacy in early detection of autism. In the extraction stage, all cases at risk of childhood problems, including developmental abnormality, are identified; in the refinement stage, cases without problems are excluded, leaving only cases with conclusive diagnoses. Methods: The city of Yokohama, Japan, conducts a routine child health surveillance program for children at 18 months in which specialized public health nurses administer YACHT-18 (Young Autism and other developmental disorders CHeckup Tool), a screening instrument to identify children at risk for developmental disorders. Children who screen positive undergo further observation, and those without disorders are subsequently excluded. To study the efficacy of early detection procedures for developmental disorders, including autism, 2,814 children born in 1988, examined at 18 months of age, and not already receiving treatment for diseases or disorders were selected. Results: In the extraction stage, 402 (14.3%) children were identified for follow-up. In the refinement stage, 19 (.7%) of these were referred to the Yokohama Rehabilitation Center and diagnosed with developmental disorders. The extraction stage produced four false negatives, bringing total diagnoses of developmental disorders to 23 (.8%)—including 5 with autistic disorder and 9 with pervasive developmental disorder—not otherwise specified (PDDNOS). Sensitivity was 60% for autistic disorder and 82.6% for developmental disorders. Specificity for developmental disorders rose to 100% with the E&R Strategy. Picture cards used in YACHT-18 provided a finer screen that excluded some false positive cases. Conclusions: An extraction and refinement methodology utilizing child health surveillance programs achieve high efficacy for early detection of autism.

Abstract = {A false feedback paradigm was used to produce a discrepancy between expected and "actual" tumescence among 57 sexually dysfunctional and 58 sexually functional men randomly assigned to one of four false tumescence feedback conditions: negative (NEG), neutral (NEU), positive (POS), or no (NO) feedback. Participants predicted an erection score before viewing an erotic film and then received false tumescence feedback based on this score. Tumescence and cognitive ratings were obtained before and after the feedback. It was predicted that discrepancies would differ between dysfunctional and functional participants such that functional participants would have the ability to overcome discrepancies, whereas dysfunctional participants would not. As expected, POS decreased tumescence for dysfunctional participants and NO did not influence tumescence for either group. Unexpectedly, NEU decreased tumescence for dysfunctional participants and NEG decreased tumescence for functional participants. Despite tumescence changes, cognitive ratings generally followed the feedback that was given. These results only partially support current models of sexual dysfunction and behavioral regulation. Anxiety, self-focused attention, cognitive interference, and unexpectedness of the feedback could not account for the partial support. However, most feedback that was outside of the realm of the status quo for both functional and dysfunctional participants did decrease tumescence, despite outcome expectancies. These results suggest that both functional and dysfunctional men may be at risk for erectile failure should feedback about their performance be discrepant from what they expect. Prevention and treatment should focus on preparing men for occasional erectile failure and on helping them overcome discrepant feedback. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Clearly, the discussion leads to recommendations about appropriate sampling, measurement, design, analysis, and presentation and evaluation of results. Rather than repeating these, let us instead indulge in a flight of fancy on "How to Lie with Statistics." We would then consider the relative importance of false positives versus false negatives, and set w. Then, we would proceed to execute the study, to estimate probabilities in the two-by-two table and to compute the appropriate k(w) from the data. To get 95% two-tailed confidence intervals, we would use a bootstrap procedure. If zero is not contained within that confidence interval we would be assured that association was "statistically significant" at the two-tailed 5% level To assess the clinical significance of the finding, we might compare the estimated k(w) against the intraclass reliability kappa for D, or against other possible tests for D. The results would undoubtedly be far less exciting than those from the first study, but would likely be closer to the truth, and more likely to be replicable across future studies.

For each targeted percentage, low, moderate, and high inter-response times (IRTs) to event-run ratios were compared with reversal designs to determine whether sensitivity increased with either variation of MTS. The results showed that (a) combinations of 30 s and 1 min MTS/PIR yielded increased sensitivity over MTS alone; however, the increased sensitivity was offset by an increased probability of generating false positives and (b) variable-interval MTS produced comparable sensitivity to fixed-interval MTS. Thus, none of the methods increased detection of small behavior changes (decreased false negatives) without also increasing false positives.

Abstract = {Functional mapping of eloquent cortex is often necessary prior to invasive brain surgery, but current techniques that derive this mapping have important limitations. In this article, we demonstrate the first comprehensive evaluation of a rapid, robust, and practical mapping system that uses passive recordings of electrocorticographic signals. This mapping procedure is based on the BCI2000 and SIGFRIED technologies that we have been developing over the past several years. In our study, we evaluated 10 patients with epilepsy from four different institutions and compared the results of our procedure with the results derived using electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) mapping. The results show that our procedure derives a functional motor cortical map in only a few minutes. They also show a substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS mapping. Specifically, compared with ECS maps, a next-neighbor evaluation showed no false negatives, and only 0.46 and 1.10% false positives for hand and tongue maps, respectively. In summary, we demonstrate the first comprehensive evaluation of a practical and robust mapping procedure that could become a new tool for planning of invasive brain surgeries.

Abstract = {Recent studies in the United States indicate that some neurologically intact minority groupings perform well below White Americans on neuropsychological tests. This has sparked the production of race-norms, especially for African Americans, that seek to reduce false positive rates (i.e., neurologically intact individuals misdiagnosed with cognitive impairment) in neuropsychological assessments. There are problems with this enterprise including: possible justification for inferior/superior treatment of different racial groupings; unknown effects on false negative rates (i.e., cognitive deficit misdiagnosed as normal); the overlooking of factors possibly responsible for group racial differences (e.g., acculturation); non-scientific and non-operational definitions of race/ethnic groupings; and an impossibly large number of potential race/ ethnic groupings for which to generate race-norms. An alternative approach is to use a single set of combined race/ ethnic norms and estimate preexisting neuropsychological skill levels by using individual comparison standards. This alternative has been poorly researched, a situation that needs correcting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Many epilepsy centers use provocative techniques (inductions) during EEG-video monitoring to aid in the diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Provocative techniques are not always necessary, and they should only be used when they help establish the diagnosis. There are several situations where inductions have significant advantages. When attacks do not occur spontaneously, provocative techniques can turn an inconclusive evaluation into a diagnostic one. Triggering an attack with induction can shorten the evaluation, decreasing its cost and reducing waiting time in the monitoring unit. Patients with infrequent episodes (that do not occur frequently enough to obtain a spontaneous event during monitoring) can be scheduled for a brief outpatient monitoring with induction. In clinical scenarios where symptoms are consistent with a "simple partial" seizure, the very presence of suggestibility is in itself a very strong additional argument to support a psychogenic etiology. The arguments against inductions are mainly based on ethical concerns. While these concerns have some validity, they are, in the real world, far outweighed by the alternatives. It is far more unethical to not obtain a definitive diagnosis when it would be possible, since the consequences of perpetuating the wrong diagnosis are many and serious. Even with placebo the benefits far outweigh the very minor ethical theoretical concerns, and the use of placebo is not even necessary. When correctly performed and interpreted, the specificity of inductions is over 90%. All tests have limitations, with some false positives and false negatives. Like all other tests, inductions must be used appropriately and with awareness of their limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Problems associated with alcohol abuse are recognized by the World Health Organization as a major health issue, which according to most recent estimations is responsible for 1.4% of the total world burden of morbidity and has been proven to increase mortality risk by 50%. Because of the size and severity of the problem, early detection is very important. This requires easy to use and specific tools. One of these is the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Aim: This study aims to standardize the questionnaire in a Greek population. Methods: AUDIT was translated and back-translated from its original language by two English speaking psychiatrists. The tool contains 10 questions. A score ≥11 is an indication of serious abuse/dependence. In the study, 218 subjects took part: 128 were males and 90 females. The average age was 40.71 years (±11.34). From the 218 individuals, 109 (75 male, 34 female) fulfilled the criteria for alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), and presented requesting admission; 109 subjects (53 male, 56 female) were healthy controls. Results: Internal reliability (Cronbach α) was 0.80 for the controls and 0.80 for the alcohol dependent individuals. Controls had significantly lower average scores (t test P < 0.001) when compared to the alcoholics. The questionnaire's sensitivity for scores >8 was 0.98 and its specificity was 0.94 for the same score. For the alcohol-dependent sample 3% scored as false negatives and from the control group 1.8% scored false positives. In the alcohol-dependent sample there was no difference between males and females in their average scores (t test P > 0.05). Conclusion: The Greek version of AUDIT has increased internal reliability and validity. It detects 97% of the alcohol-dependent individuals and has a high sensitivity and specificity. AUDIT is easy to use, quick and reliable and can be very useful in detection alcohol problems in sensitive populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: This paper draws on cognitive psychology research and clinical observation to propose a model for the formation of auditory hallucinations that are located externally, and experienced in noisy environments. Method: This model highlights a series of cognitive processes that may make an individual prone to detecting false positives, i. e. believing they have heard something that is absent. A case study is used to illustrate the model. Results: It is suggested that the false positives may be a by-product of a perceptual system that has evolved to reduce false negatives in conditions of threat. The term hypervigilance hallucination is proposed for this type of experience. Conclusion: The clinical implications of the model are discussed.

Abstract = {Performance of robots in human robot teams has always been a topic of interest for many researchers in human robot interaction community. Traditionally adopted neglect tolerance model for performance measurements assume ideal conditions in which the operator switches control between robots sequentially based on acceptable performance level for each robot ignoring any false alarms due to erroneous interactions. In this paper, we present the false alarm demand, a new metric for measuring effects of false alarms on human robot team performance and extend the neglect tolerance model to situations in which false positives and false negatives are prevalent. Experiments were performed with real and virtual humanoid soccer robots across tele-operated, and point to point modes of autonomy. Measured false alarm demand and robot performances were largely consistent with the proposed extended neglect tolerance model predictions for real and virtual experiments for both autonomy modes. Experiments also showed that extended neglect tolerance model offered better estimation of robot performances as compared to the traditionally adopted neglect tolerance model for situations wherein false alarms are prevalent.

Abstract = {Background: The volume of research involving adjustment disorder (AD) is limited. The scientific neglect of AD seems to result from the inadequate operationalisation of AD in DSM-IV and ICD-10. The aims of the present proposal are to discuss the shortcomings of AD conceptualizations and to present recommendations for the future. Sampling and Methods: This conceptual paper is based on an iterative process of debate between the authors. Results: The current operational definition of AD is characterized by 3 main limitations: (1) the inadequately defined clinical significance criterion, (2) the relegation of AD behind other diagnoses and (3) the missed recognition of the importance of contextual factors, such that normal human adaptive processes might be pathologised. Furthermore, subtypes of AD lack operational clarity. Based on a discussion of the limitations, recommendations for DSM-V are presented, including the addition of new subtypes. Conclusions: The revision of AD criteria will reduce the likelihood of false-positive and false-negative diagnoses. These changes will enable the scientific exploration of this common and relevant disorder, and will make epidemiological studies, and ultimately service planning based on these, more reliable than at present.

Abstract = {Background: Two types of transdermal electrochemical sensors that detect alcohol at the skin surface were evaluated. One, the AMS SCRAMTM device, is locked onto the ankle and is based on a fuel cell sensor; the other, a Giner WrisTASTM device, worn on the wrist, is based on a proton exchange membrane. SCRAM is used by several court systems in the United States to monitor alcohol offenders, WrisTAS, a research prototype, is not commercially available. Methods: The 2 devices were worn concurrently by 22 paid research subjects (15 men, 7 women), for a combined total of 96 weeks. Subjects participated in both laboratory-dosed drinking to a target of 0.08 g ⁄ dl blood alcohol concentration (BAC), and normal drinking on their own; all subjects were trained to use and carry a portable fuel-cell breath tester for BAC determinations. Overall 271 drinking episodes with BAC ≥ 0.02 g ⁄ dl formed the signal for detection—60 from laboratory dosing, and 211 from self-dosed drinking, with BAC ranging from 0.02 to 0.230 g ⁄ dl (mean 0.077 g ⁄ dl). Results: False negatives were defined as a transdermal alcohol concentration response equivalent <0.02 g ⁄ dl when BAC ≥ 0.02 g ⁄ dl. The overall true-positive hit rate detected by WrisTAS was 24%. The low detection rate was due to erratic output and not recording during nearly 67% of all episodes; reportedly a chipset, not a sensor problem. SCRAM correctly detected 57% across all BAC events, with another 22% (total 79%) detected, but as <0.02 g ⁄ dl. When subjects dosed themselves to BAC ≥ 0.08 g ⁄ dl, SCRAM correctly detected 88% of these events. SCRAM devices lost accuracy over time likely due to water accumulation in the sensor housing. Neither unit had false-positive problems when true BAC was <0.02 g ⁄ dl. Conclusions: Each device had peculiarities that reduced performance, but both types are able to detect alcohol at the skin surface. With product improvements, transdermal sensing may become a valuable way to monitor the alcohol consumption of those who should be abstaining.

Abstract = {From an evolutionary psychological perspective, the authors elaborate on the methodology and fundamental theory in the research of cognitive biases. This perspective holds that biased cognition may often be a design feature done by evolutionary selection. The error management theory of cognitive biases predicts that if cognitions are made under uncertainty, and the costs of false positive and false negative errors have been asymmetric over evolutionary history, evolutionary selection will favor a bias toward making the least costly error. The approach of evolutinary psychology in the research of cognition biases will contribute to yielding new content specific predictions of congnition biases by the number.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by J. W. Lee (see record [rid]2013-23816-028[/rid]). Lee and colleagues reporting that nimodipine may be an effective therapy in the treatment of headache associated with sexual activity. The article postulated a pathophysiological relationship between orgasmic headache (OH) and migraine, especially with respect to vasoconstriction. The causes of headaches related to sexual activity range from the benign to the life-threatening. Segmental vasospasm may exert a role in the pathogenesis of this uncommon type of headache. Some authors suggest that there is a possible link between orgasmic headaches and migraines. Others found that women treated for migraine displayed a high rate of sexual symptoms and distress. Although brain computed tomography (CT) showed no subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), primary headache associated with sexual activity, including preorgasmic and orgasmic, can be a manifestation of structural disease. SAH must be ruled out when headache associated with sexual activity occurs for the first time. CT is likely to give false negatives. Although the patient has no sign of meningeal irritation, it seems mandatory to exclude SAH by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, even if the presentation is typical for OH. CSF examination should be the rule in thunderclap headache with no SAH on brain CT, especially if the latter was performed two or more days after the onset of headache. Moreover, the authors failed to point out when the CT was performed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Kotzalidis, Simone Di Pietro, Antonio Del Casale and Antonella De Carolis (European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2014[Jan], Vol 23[1], 53-55). In the original article, the family name of fourth author was erroneously reported as ‘‘Casale’’. The correct family name should be ‘‘Del Casale’’. The correction is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-16383-001[/rid]). The delusional misidentification syndromes, occurring within the context of different nosological settings, such as schizophrenia, are psychopathological phenomena related to the experience of depersonalisation/derealisation. Extensive research indicates that individuals meeting specific "prodromal" criteria, such as attenuated psychotic symptoms, brief intermittent psychotic symptoms, or functional decline and family history of schizophrenia have increased risk for impending psychosis. Despite depersonalisation and/or derealisation often precede psychotic onset, they are not included among the prodromal criteria of the Australian–American approach. A 17-year-old boy with acute agitation, violent behaviour and aggression, and dissociative amnesia had a mild verbal memory impairment and temporo-limbic hypometabolism on the positron-emission tomography. The patient was assessed with both the ultra-high risk (UHR) and the basic symptom approaches and was not found to be prodromal with imminent risk of transition to psychosis. He was hospitalised briefly and 2 weeks after discharge he developed delusional misidentification. This case shows that even the integration of both UHR and basic symptoms criteria may give false negatives in the prediction of psychosis, especially in those cases in which a long prodromal phase is absent.

Abstract = {In this work we develop and apply a class of hierarchical directed graphical models on the task of recognizing affective categories from prosody in both acted and natural speech. A strength of this new approach is the integration and summarization of information using both local (e.g., syllable level) and global prosodic phenomena (e.g., utterance level). In this framework speech is structurally modeled as a dynamically evolving hierarchical model in which levels of the hierarchy are determined by prosodic constituency and contain parameters that evolve according to dynamical systems. The acoustic parameters have been chosen to reflect four main components of speech thought to reflect paralinguistic and affect-specific information: intonation, loudness, rhythm and voice quality. The work is first evaluated on a database of acted emotions and compared to human perceptual recognition of five affective categories where it achieves rates within nearly 10% of human recognition accuracy despite only focusing on prosody. The model is then evaluated on two different corpora of fully spontaneous, affectively-colored, naturally occurring speech between people: Call Home English and BT Call Center. Here the ground truth labels are obtained from examining the agreement of 29 human coders labeling arousal and valence. The best discrimination performance on the natural spontaneous speech, using only the prosody features, obtains a 70% detection rate with 30% false alarms when detecting high arousal negative valence speech in call centers.

Abstract = {Objective: To delineate the F wave latency/height (Fmin/He) or F wave latency/limb length (Fmin/L) ratio as a more useful alternative for the currently reported shortest latency in milliseconds. Methods: One hundred and sixty-six healthy volunteers, 85 upper limbs and 84 lower limbs entered the study. Minimum F wave latencies were determined in median, ulnar, tibial and peroneal nerves. The Fmin/He and Fmin/L ratios of each nerve were calculated. Results: F latencies of all nerves had significant correlation with height and limb length but there was no correlation between either Fmin/He or Fmin/L and height in any nerve except for peroneal Fmin/He (p = 0.04, r = 0.23). Conclusions: Using the Fmin/He or Fmin/L ratios are more accurate than reporting only the F wave minimum latency, since these ratios incorporate corrections for height and/or limb length. This method also eliminates the false positive and negative reports caused by using a single reference table for all heights. Significance: A unique reference table can be produced using the Fmin/He or Fmin/L for all populations and races, so that the comparison between different population samples can be done easily. Also data of different investigations can be pooled together for meta-analysis purposes when a single reference table is used for different samples.

Abstract = {Background: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are a core symptom of schizophrenia. Previous reports on neural activity patterns associated with AVHs are inconsistent, arguably owing to the lack of an adequate control group (i.e., patients with similar characteristics but without AVHs) and neglect of the potential confounding effects of medication. Methods: The current study was conducted in a homogeneous group of patients with schizophrenia to assess whether the presence or absence of AVHs was associated with differential regional cerebral glucose metabolic patterns. We investigated differences between patients with commenting AVHs and patients without AVHs among a group of dextral antipsychotic-naive inpatients with acute first-episode schizophrenia examined with [¹⁸F]fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) at rest. Univariate and multivariate approaches were used to establish between-group differences. Results: We included 9 patients with AVHs and 7 patients without AVHs in this study. Patients experiencing AVHs during FDG uptake had significantly higher metabolic rates in the left superior and middle temporal cortices, bilateral superior medial frontal cortex and left caudate nucleus (cluster level p < 0.005, family wise error–corrected, and bootstrap ratio > 3.3, respectively). Additionally, the multivariate method identified hippocampal–parahippocampal, cerebellar and parietal relative hypoactivity during AVHs in both hemispheres (bootstrap ratio < −3.3). Limitations: The FDG-PET imaging technique does not provide information regarding the temporal course of neural activity. The limited sample size may have increased the risk of false-negative findings. Conclusion: Our results indicate that AVHs in patients with schizophrenia may be mediated by an alteration of neural pathways responsible for normal language function. Our findings also point to the potential role of the dominant caudate nucleus and the parahippocampal gyri in the pathophysiology of AVHs. We discuss the relevance of phenomenology-based grouping in the study of AVHs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: In many English-speaking countries neuropsychological assessment of non-English speakers is often performed in English or through an interpreter. Relying on interpreters often involves unstandardized and ad hoc translations of tests which may limit valid assessment. Methods: In a sample of 75 Italian-born elderly Australians from the general community (48 women and 27 men, aged 56-90 years) we administered standardized and normed psychological tests in both English (WMS-III, WAIS-III, BNT, Schonell Graded Word Reading Test) and Italian (Milan Overall Dementia Assessment, MODA). We examined the hypothesis that long-term retrieval ability assessed in English is primarily influenced by cognitive abilities assessed in Italian and by English language competence. Results: Regression analysis showed that the strongest predictor of long-term retrieval in English was long-term retrieval in Italian (R² = 0.229, F(72) = 29.12, p < 0.01). After inclusion of an estimate of general cognitive ability in Italian, English language competence failed to add significantly to variance explained in memory tested in English (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Results of the present study support the view that long-term retrieval memory is not significantly affected by second language proficiency after control of cognitive ability assessed in Italian. As a consequence, if an Italian-born elder Australian with English as a second language scores poorly on a diagnostic memory test, this result may be due to cognitive impairment rather than language issues. If, instead, we attribute poor performance to language competence, an increased risk of false negative diagnosis may arise. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: Computerized continuous performance test (CPT) is a widely used diagnostic tool for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It measures the number of correctly detected stimuli as well as response times. Typically, when calculating a cut-off score for discriminating between normal and abnormal, only the normal children’s data are collected. Then the average and standard deviation of each measure or variable is computed. If any of variables is larger than 2 sigma above the average, that child is diagnosed as abnormal. We will call this approach as "T-score 70" classifier. However, its performance has a lot to be desired due to a high false negative error. In order to improve the classification accuracy we propose to use novelty detection approaches for supporting ADHD diagnosis. Methods and material: Novelty detection is a model building framework where a classifier is constructed using only one class of training data and a new input pattern is classified according to its similarity to the training data. A total of eight novelty detectors are introduced and applied to our ADHD datasets collected from two modes of tests, visual and auditory. They are evaluated and compared with the T-score model on validation datasets in terms of false positive and negative error rates, and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AuROC). Results: Experimental results show that the cut-off score of 70 is suboptimal which leads to a low false positive error but a very high false negative error. A few novelty detectors such as Parzen density estimators yield much more balanced classification performances. Moreover, most novelty detectors outperform the T-score method for most age groups statistically with a significance level of 1% in terms of AuROC. In particular, we recommend the Parzen and Gaussian density estimators, kernel principal component analysis, one-class support vector machine, and K-means clustering novelty detector which can improve upon the T-score method on average by at least 30% for the visual test and 40% for the auditory test. In addition, their performances are relatively stable over various parameter values as long as they are within reasonable ranges. Conclusion: The proposed novelty detection approaches can replace the T-score method which has been considered the "gold standard" for supporting ADHD diagnosis. Furthermore, they can be applied to other psychological tests where only normal data are available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Building on a handful of studies demonstrating battered women's accuracy in assessing their risk of being physically reabused, this study examined how accurately victims assess their risk of future psychological abuse. Participants' ratings of the likelihood that their partner would engage in controlling/dominance behaviors or efforts to humiliate/degrade them in the coming year and their reports 18 months later of whether this had actually occurred were used to create a four category version of accuracy (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative). Victims were more likely to be right than wrong in their assessments of risk; PTSD symptoms, the recency of physical violence, and the degree of stalking and psychological abuse in the relationship predicted membership in the four accuracy categories. These findings overlap considerably with those examining victim accuracy in predicting physical abuse and inform ongoing debates about the value of incorporating victims' insights into risk assessment efforts.

Abstract = {Objective: The aims of the study were to translate and adapt both the negative and positive items of the Psychological Consequences Questionnaire (PCQ) into Danish and to test the translated version for comprehension, suitability, and content coverage by developing new items in a setting of false-positive screening mammography. Design: The translation was carried out following an internationally accepted method involving two panels: bilingual and lay. Subjects: The suitability and the content coverage of the PCQ were tested in six group interviews. Participants in the interviews were women who had had a false-positive screening mammography. They were grouped according to additional examinations they experienced following abnormal screening mammography. The audio-recordings from the group interviews were thematically analysed to identify the key consequences of abnormal and false-positive screening mammography. Results: Fifteen new items were generated to cover the negative psychosocial consequences of abnormal and false-positive screening mammography comprehensively. Five new items were produced that concerned the consequences of screening mammography during the period after being declared “free from” suspicion of cancer. Three items from the PCQ were deleted because they were judged by interviewees to be irrelevant. Response options for the positive items were changed to allow responses in both positive and negative directions. Conclusion: Because of the major changes to both parts of the PCQ the measure derived from this study should be regarded as a new questionnaire with two parts: Consequences Of Screening in Breast Cancer (COS-BC). Part II focuses on the long-term consequences of a false-positive screening mammography. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {This editorial presents an argument for the publication of clinical trials with negative results. Randomized, controlled clinical trials with negative results are viewed with more skepticism than trials with positive results. A widely held assumption is that negative results are not interesting and therefore do not deserve a place in the peer-reviewed literature. Journals may reject manuscripts in the belief that the results represent a false negative because of a flawed study design or poor trial execution. No journal wants to publish false positive or false negative results, so the same criteria should be applied to all trials. Trial design, conduct, and statistical analysis must be satisfactory.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by S. A. Meda et al. (see record [rid]2012-06484-001[/rid]). Meda et al. have reported an interesting and technically advanced study that seeks to explore the relationships between species of psychosis at the level of brain systems or networks. In doing so, they carry forward another seminal concept that has been in the background of psychiatry since the 19th century: the idea, arguably originating with Meynert and Wernicke, that psychotic disorders arise from a disruption of connections between different brain regions. In their study, Meda et al. measured brain functional networks using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample comprising patients with bipolar disorder, patients with schizophrenia, the first-degree relatives of both patient groups, and healthy volunteers. This was a relatively large and carefully characterized sample for an fMRI-based investigation, which is one of the fundamental strengths of the study. The resting state fMRI measurements from each participant were first analyzed using independent component analysis to define 16 large-scale brain networks, so-called resting state networks (RSNs). On this basis, Meda et al. explored differences of Internetwork coupling in the relatives compared with healthy volunteers, predicting that if the network abnormalities in patients were markers of genetic risk, they should be evident also in the first-degree relatives of patients. This prediction was partly supported by the data: the relatives of patients with bipolar disorder showed abnormalities of between-network connectivity that largely overlapped with the profile seen in bipolar patients. However, there were no significant abnormalities of network organization demonstrated in the relatives of patients with schizophrenia. The study by Meda et al. is an important proof of principle. It demonstrates the utility and feasibility of using resting state fMRI measurements to find diagnostically cross-cutting biomarkers that represent commonality of brain disorganization across nosologically distinct species of disorder. It thus stands as an example of the ambition to progressively refine and enrich, possibly to reconstruct, diagnostic systems in psychiatry by making greater use of biological data. Sample composition and sample size are always important considerations. The study by Meda et al. is unusually large and carefully composed, certainly by the general standard of fMRI research in psychiatry. But it remains possible that some of the negative results, such as the lack of abnormality of network metrics in the relatives of people with schizophrenia, could be false-negative or type 2 errors. If we want functional neuroimaging to advance to the point of being able to reconstruct long-established diagnostic frameworks or to provide endophenotypes that might be the targets of genetic association analysis, we will need larger, epidemiologically principled samples whose collection will entail coordination across multiple clinical research groups.

Abstract = {Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an important health problem affecting millions of people each year. A significant high incidence of UTI can be seen in individuals with disabilities, especially those with paralysis due to spinal cord injury. Dip stick screening tests may offer promise as an early warning system of UTI since they are easy to perform and can be self-administered. Here, we report our experience of the diagnostic value of the urine strip test for white blood cell count in medical laboratory practice. The sensitivity of urine strip test was 100%, the specificity 92.2%, the positive predictive value 33.8% and the negative predictive value 100%. False positive was 7.8% and false negative 0%. This can confirm the needs for further examination in cases with positive urine strip screening test. Hence, the usage of urine strip examination as a screening tool for pyuria, an early sign of UTI among people with disabilities is recommended.

Abstract = {Ranking a group of candidate sites and selecting from it the high-risk locations or hotspots for detailed engineering study and countermeasure evaluation is the first step in a transport safety improvement program. Past studies have however mainly focused on the task of applying appropriate methods for ranking locations, with few focusing on the issue of how to define selection methods or threshold rules for hotspot identification. The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a multiple testing-based approach to the problem of selecting hotspots. Following the recent developments in the literature, two testing procedures are studied under a Bayesian framework: Bayesian test with weights (BTW) and a Bayesian test controlling for the posterior false discovery rate (FDR) or false negative rate (FNR). The hypotheses tests are implemented on the basis of two random effect or Bayesian models, namely, the hierarchical Poisson/Gamma or Negative Binomial model and the hierarchical Poisson/Lognormal model. A dataset of highway-railway grade crossings is used as an application example to illustrate the proposed procedures incorporating both the posterior distribution of accident frequency and the posterior distribution of ranks. Results on the effects of various decision parameters used in hotspot identification procedures are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Eight- and 12-year-old children were presented with neutral and negative emotional Deese-Roediger-McDermott lists equated on familiarity and associative strength. Both recall and recognition (A′) measures were obtained. Recall measures exhibited the usual age increments in true and false recollection. True neutral items were better recalled and recognized than true negative emotional items. Although the children showed more false recall for neutral than for negative emotional lists, false recognition was higher for negative emotional than for neutral items. A′ analyses also showed that whereas true neutral information and false neutral information were easily discriminated by children regardless of age, the same was not the case for true and false negative emotional information. Together, these results suggest that although children may be able to censor negative emotional information at recall, such information promotes relational processing in children's memory, making true and false emotional information less discriminable overall.

Abstract = {Using four categories of accuracy (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative), this study explored (1) how accurately intimate partner violence (IPV) victims are able to assess their risk of re-abuse; and (2) potential predictors of accuracy. Women seeking help for IPV (N = 246) rated the likelihood that they would experience physical re-abuse in the coming year and then reported 18 months later whether those risks had been realized. Victim assessments were more likely to be right than wrong, and were subject to neither a pessimistic nor optimistic bias. In the multivariate analysis, significant/marginally significant predictors of the accuracy categories were the history of violence from this and former partners, level of substance use, PTSD symptoms, and the recency of the violence. Among the more robust findings were the connection between level of stalking and true positives, and between substance use and false negatives.

Participants included women without sexual dysfunction (n = 16) and women with Sexual Arousal Disorder (SAD; n = 15). Measures of subjective sexual arousal, physiological sexual arousal (vaginal pulse amplitude), expectancies, affect, and anxiety were obtained in response to viewing an erotic film. Results indicated that false positive feedback significantly increased subjective levels of sexual arousal, whereas false negative feedback significantly decreased subjective levels of sexual arousal in both groups. Sexually functional women had overall higher expectancies for sexual arousal than women with SAD. Unexpectedly, false positive feedback did not significantly impact physiological sexual arousal in sexually functional women; however, it resulted in significantly decreased responses in physiological sexual arousal in women with SAD. False negative feedback had no significant effect on physiological sexual response in sexually functional women or women with SAD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Method: A total of 1000 subjects over the age of 65 years were recruited for the study. The community health workers identified nine subjects as having dementia. This was compared against an education adjusted diagnosis of dementia made in accordance with the 10/66 dementia research group protocol. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the community health worker diagnosis was 3.8% and 99.4% respectively. The false positive rate and positive predictive values were 55.6% and 44.4%, respectively. The false negative rate and negative predictive value were 10.3% and 89.7% respectively. Similar values were obtained against a DSM IV diagnosis. Subjects with dementia who were correctly diagnosed by the community health workers and those whose condition was missed did not differ significantly on socio-demographic and clinical variables.

Abstract = {Objectives: The primary objective in this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a two-item screening interview for depression versus the formal psychiatric interview, in the setting of a specialist palliative in-patient unit so that we may identify those individuals suffering from depressive disorder and therefore optimise their management in this often-complex population. Methods: A prospective sample of consecutive admissions (n = 167) consented to partake in the study, and the screening interview was asked separately to the formal psychiatric interview. Results: The two-item questionnaire, achieved a sensitivity of 90.7% (95% CI 76.9-97.0) but a lower specificity of 67.7% (95% CI 58.7-75.7). The false positive rate was 32.3% (95% CI 24.3-41.3), but the false negative rate was found to be a low 9.3% (95% CI 3.0-23.1). A subgroup analysis of individuals with a past experience of depressive illness, (n = 95), revealed that a significant number screened positive for depression by the screening test, 55.2% (16/29) compared to those with no background history of depression, 33.3% (22/66) (P = 0.045). Conclusion: The high sensitivity and low false negative rate of the two-question screening tool will aid health professionals in identifying depression in the in-patient specialist palliative care unit. Individuals, who admit to a previous experience of depressive illness, are more likely to respond positively to the two-item questionnaire than those who report no prior history of depressive illness (P = 0.045).

Some results seem to indicate that negative mood may reduce false recall and thus suggest an influence of emotional valence on false memory. The present research tested the effects of both valence and arousal on recall and recognition and indicates that the effect is actually due to arousal. In fact, whether participants' mood is positive, negative, or neutral, false memories are significantly more frequent under conditions of high arousal than under conditions of low arousal.

Abstract = {Objectives: Depressive disorders are overrepresented among the patients admitted to non-psychiatric units in general hospitals. However, the majority of depressed patients fail to be identified within this care setting. Since a self-administered questionnaire (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) has given encouraging results in English and Spanish, new research should test its criterion validity in a French-speaking environment. Design: The study included 292 patients admitted to the internal medicine units of the University Hospitals of Geneva. Each patient filled the PHQ-9; 212 patients also underwent a blinded DSM-IV diagnostic assessment by a psychiatrist. Methods: In order to assess the validity of PHQ-9 against the gold standard of the psychiatrist's DSM-IV diagnosis, we calculated overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and Cohen kappa coefficients. We also studied the relationship between the PHQ-9 diagnostic and the severity of depression. Finally, analysis focused on the presence of a diagnosis of depression. Results. Within the framework of the study, PHQ-9 showed an acceptable level of specificity. However, its sensitivity in detecting major depression was low (about 50% of false-negative results). As regards the overall presence of depressive disorders, this instrument performed hardly any better (35% of false negatives). Other characteristics of the population under investigation may have affected the data. Conclusions: The French version of PHQ-9 demonstrated low sensitivity as compared with psychiatrist-established diagnosis of DSM-IV A criterion and major depressive episode.

Abstract = {Objective: We completed a systematic review of information reported as included in decision aids (DAs) for adult patients, to determine if it is complete, balanced and accurate. Search strategy: DAs were identified using the Cochrane Database of DAs and searches of four electronic databases using the terms: 'decision aid'; shared decision making' and 'patients'; 'multimedia or leaflets or pamphlets or videos and patients and decision making'. Additionally, publications reporting DA development and actual DAs that were reported as publicly available on the Internet were consulted. Publications were included up to May 2006. Data extraction: Data were extracted on the following variables: external groups consulted in development of the DA, type of study used, categories of information, inclusion of probabilities, use of citation lists and inclusion of patient experiences. Main results: 68 treatment DAs and 30 screening DAs were identified. 17% of treatment DAs and 47% of screening DAs did not report any external consultation and, of those that did, DA producers tended to rely more heavily on medical experts than on patients' guidance. Content evaluations showed that (i) treatment DAs frequently omit describing the procedure(s) involved in treatment options and (ii) screening DAs frequently focus on false positives but not false negatives. About 1/2 treatment DAs reported probabilities with a greater emphasis on potential benefits than harms. Similarly, screening DAs were more likely to provide false-positive than false-negative rates. Conclusions: The review led us to be concerned about completeness, balance and accuracy of information included in DAs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Episodic memory impairment is a hallmark for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Most actual tests used to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease do not assess the spatiotemporal properties of episodic memory and lead to false-positive or -negative diagnosis. We used a newly developed, nonverbal navigation test for Human, based on the objective experimental testing of a spatiotemporal experience, to differentially Alzheimer’s disease at the mild stage (N = 16 patients) from frontotemporal lobar degeneration (N = 11 patients) and normal aging (N = 24 subjects). Comparing navigation parameters and standard neuropsychological tests, temporal order memory appeared to have the highest predictive power for mild Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis versus frontotemporal lobar degeneration and normal aging. This test was also nonredundant with classical neuropsychological tests. As a conclusion, our results suggest that temporal order memory tested in a spatial navigation task may provide a selective behavioral marker of Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract = {Objective: A high rate of comorbidity among the personality disorders has been consistently identified as a problem. To address the problem of excessive comorbidity, the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group recommended reducing the number of specific personality disorder diagnoses from 10 to 5 by eliminating paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, narcissistic, and dependent personality disorders. No study has examined the impact of this change. The present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project examined the impact of eliminating these 5 personality disorders on the prevalence of personality disorders in a large sample of psychiatric outpatients presenting for treatment, comorbidity among the personality disorders, and association with psychosocial morbidity. Method: From September 1997 to June 2008, 2,150 psychiatric patients presenting to the Rhode Island Hospital outpatient practice were evaluated with semistructured diagnostic interviews for DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II disorders and measures of psychosocial morbidity. Results: More than one-quarter of the patients were diagnosed with one of the 10 DSM-IV personality disorders (28.6%, n = 614). When 5 personality disorders were excluded from consideration, then 25.8% (n = 555) were diagnosed with at least 1 of the 5 personality disorders proposed for retention in DSM-5, and the comorbidity rate dropped from 29.8% to 21.3%. Compared to patients without a personality disorder, the patients with either a retained or an excluded personality disorder had greater psychosocial morbidity. There was little difference in psychosocial morbidity between patients with a retained and an excluded personality disorder. Conclusions: The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group's desired goal of reducing comorbidity would be achieved by deleting 5 personality disorders, although comorbidity would not be eliminated. The reduction of comorbidity could come with a cost of false-negative diagnoses. The results therefore do not provide unambiguous support for the DSM-5 proposed elimination of 5 personality disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Jonathan C. Bardin et al. (see record [rid]2012-05875-005[/rid]). Bardin et al. have suggested a supplemental way to assess the command-following and communication capabilities of patients with severe brain injury that is more sensitive than conventional methods, if their proof of concept is confirmed. Bardin et al's discovery in this patient using the combination of multivariate pattern analysis and logical reasoning is thus akin to identifying a transcription error when intact messenger RNA arrives at the ribosome but enters out of frame. Bardin et al. do show their deontological importance for the rare patient who is found to be significantly more aware. In such cases, broadening the method to include the Bardin et al. refinements could be critical, further decreasing the probability of a false-negative result. At a meta-level, the attention of Bardin et al. to the question of latency and the impaired processing speed of the injured brain also points to the temporal disconnect between the time course over which the injured brain recovers and how care is reimbursed and how rehabilitation programs are paid by Medicare.

Abstract = {The term "cognitive distortion" is defined as "incorrect" information processing. These "deformed" thoughts lead the individual to reach negative and false conclusions, as in the case of pathological gambling. Before and during gambling, gamblers present certain cognitive distortions which make them think in a particular way and encourage them to continue to gamble. In this article, the authors study the illusion of control, superstition and predictive control. They also discuss the various psychometric tools available to evaluate cognitive distortions during the management of pathological gambling. This article demonstrates the value of analysis of cognitive distortions in the management of pathological gambling, particularly in cognitive and behavioural therapy.

Abstract = {Presents a case report where eight pedicle screws were stimulated via a monopolar intraoperative stimulation probe. Empirical data support the stimulation of pedicle screws intraoperatively to reduce the risk of neural damage to exiting nerve roots post-operatively. The reference was placed in the wound rostral to stimulation, not far from the stimulus. A rep rate of 2.79 Hz and duration of .2 msec was utilized. Sub-maximal stimulation was utilized to obtain the response. This is the least amount of current needed to elicit a compound muscle action potential. Intraoperative fluoroscopy did not indicate a medial breach. However, a medial breach was found upon manual inspection. Direct stimulation to the point of the breach elicited a triggered electromyography (t-EMG) response at 1.7 mA, thus confirming a medial breach. The screw was redirected and re-stimulated. After reposition, the screw elicited an EMG response at 24 mA. To summarize, the left SI screw was placed medially however, intraoperative x-ray and electroneurophysiological monitoring indicated that the screw was completely within pedicle. A red-flag was raised when the rest of the screws elicited t-EMG responses that would indicate false negatives occurring. However, instead of focusing on the seven screws that had abnormally high impedance thresholds, the focus turned to the anomaly of the group, the 12 mA screw.

In this paper I show that robustness mainly refers to α, the type-I error.

Abstract = {Objective: Eating disorders (ED) are disabling, unpredictable, and difficult to treat. The high percentage of false negatives at screening test indicates that up to now the prevalence of ED in adolescents could have been underestimated. The aim of the study was to evaluate the Factor structure of "Risk Test" (RT), a 16-item questionnaire recommended by Italian Government for screening young people to assess the risk for ED by studying their behaviour style and emotional/affective involvement related to eating attitudes and the need to apply the RT in a non clinical context. Method: 422 students, between 16 and 32 years, were assessed using RT. All participants spoke Italian as their mother-tongue or were fluent in Italian. Results: An exploratory Factor Analysis was used in order to generate hypotheses about underlying processes measured by the instrument. A five factor solution was generated by the analysis, accounting for 69.7% of the total variance. Conclusions: The RT was well accepted by the patients and needed very little supervision by the interviewer. Our data suggests the importance of the dimensions evaluation of RT ("Fear-emotional-impulsive factor", "Behavioural factor", "Physical and mood disruption", "Safe" and "Unsafe attitude"). The factor structure of the RT is consistent with the underlining cognitive structure of disturbed eating behaviour which is able to be treated with a preventive, cognitively oriented psychological approach.

Abstract = {In their stimulating article, David and Montgomery (2011) underscore the importance of identifying pseudoscientific and potentially harmful psychotherapies, and observe that the criteria for empirically supported therapies neglect to take into account the theoretical support for treatment packages. They propose a framework for evidence-based therapies that includes empirical support for both the efficacy of the treatment and the theory that spawned it. I discuss several challenges to this and similar frameworks, including (a) the absence of convincing data regarding how most current therapies work, (b) the underdetermination of theory by data, making it difficult to strongly corroborate models of therapeutic change mechanisms using only a small number of studies, and (c) the risk of false negatives, viz., efficacious treatments derived from nonexistent or flawed theories. As a friendly amendment, I propose a Bayesian alternative to David and Montgomery’s classification that incorporates the role of theoretical plausibility while minimizing the aforementioned difficulties.

The neuropathologic study and meta-analysis cited by Dr. Rothstein report nonhypothermia patients. These results may not extend to patients treated with hypothermia. Caution is warranted when adopting prognostic parameters from nonhypothermia patients to hypothermia patients. In addition, and in contrast to the study by Rothstein, the meta-analysis of Wijdicks et al. found a 0.7% false-positive rate for bilateral negative N20. In view of these recent studies, we agree with Dr. Rothstein that somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) are a valuable prognostic parameter, even in hypothermia patients. Pooled analysis of the mentioned SSEP studies on hypothermia patients gives a 1.2% false-positive rate (1/85), which falls within the 95% confidence interval for nonhypothermia patients. While recent studies—including our own—suggest that only a small minority of patients may recover despite absent N20, it is important to establish this fact more reliably. Finally, the timing of SSEP recordings after cardiac arrest should be reevaluated to avoid false decisions in individual patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: The SCID-I structured clinical interview based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria is widely used internationally, but the reliability and validity of its Hungarian version has not been investigated. This paper presents the results of the first validity and reliability study of the Hungarian version of the SCID-I/NP's (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders Non-patient Edition) Anxiety Disorders module. Methods: The language adaptation of the diagnostic interview and of the user's guide was conducted in accordance with the WHO recommendations. Measures: SCID-I/NP Overview and Screening module; SCID-I/NP Module F: Anxiety Disorders; Tests providing external validity: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The study sample consisted of 741 patients attended at three CP's offices. The trial's duration was two months. Statistical analyses: GLM analysis, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Kappa and weighted Kappa statistics. Results: Results showed a significant interrater-agreement between the rater pairs. For screening modules yielding negative results, the false-negative analysis indicated a subthreshold positive diagnosis in one case. External validity analyses showed significant discrepancies in terms of gender, marital status and past psychiatric treatments among the three sample groups including those with diagnosis present, subthreshold diagnosis, diagnosis absent. In terms . the psychometric scales, we found significant differences on the BAI and the ASRS in these groups. In the case of AQ we found significant differences in total score and in the factors of hostility and anger: the diagnosis present group showed significantly elevated severity values compared to the other two groups. Conclusions: The Anxiety Disorders Module of the SCID-I/NP is suitable for detecting anxiety disorders in non-psychiatric population, and hence enables the early admission for treatment.

Abstract = {The current study sought to report the base rates of Symptom Validity Test (SVT) failure in an active duty military sample as well as to compare the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Effort Index (EI) to stand-alone measures of symptom validity. SVT failure varied from previous studies and even among different subgroups in the current sample, ranging from 8% to 30%. The RBANS EI demonstrated modest sensitivity in the detection of suboptimal effort when compared with stand-alone SVTs. Although the index appears to add some utility to the detection of suboptimal effort, sole use of the EI as a measure of symptom validity could conceivably result in an unnecessarily high rate of false negatives.

Abstract = {Background: The capacity of friends and family member informants to make judgments about the presence of a mood disorder history in an older primary care patient has theoretical, clinical, and public health significance. This study examined the accuracy of informant-reported mood disorder diagnoses in a sample of primary care patients aged 65 years or older. We hypothesized that the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of informant reports would vary with the patient's personality. Methods: Hypotheses were tested in 191 dyads consisting of patients and their friends or relatives (informants) recruited from primary care settings. Gold-standard mood disorder diagnoses were established at consensus conferences based on a review of medical charts and data collected in a structured interview with the patient. Patients completed an assessment battery that included the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of informant-derived mood disorder diagnoses were related to patient personality. Sensitivity of informant-derived lifetime mood disorder diagnoses was compromised by higher Extraversion and higher Agreeableness. Specificity of informant-derived lifetime mood disorder diagnoses was compromised by lower Agreeableness and higher Conscientiousness. Conclusion: Patient personality has implications for the accuracy of mood disorder histories provided by friends and family members. Given that false negatives can have grave consequences, we recommend that practitioners be particularly vigilant when interpreting collateral information about their extraverted, agreeable patients.

Abstract = {Whole brain extraction is an important pre-processing step in neuroimage analysis. Manual or semi-automated brain delineations are labour-intensive and thus not desirable in large studies, meaning that automated techniques are preferable. The accuracy and robustness of automated methods are crucial because human expertise may be required to correct any suboptimal results, which can be very time consuming. We compared the accuracy of four automated brain extraction methods: Brain Extraction Tool (BET), Brain Surface Extractor (BSE), Hybrid Watershed Algorithm (HWA) and a Multi-Atlas Propagation and Segmentation (MAPS) technique we have previously developed for hippocampal segmentation. The four methods were applied to extract whole brains from 682 1.5 T and 157 3 T T₁-weighted MR baseline images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Semi-automated brain segmentations with manual editing and checking were used as the gold-standard to compare with the results. The median Jaccard index of MAPS was higher than HWA, BET and BSE in 1.5 T and 3 T scans (p < 0.05, all tests), and the 1st to 99th centile range of the Jaccard index of MAPS was smaller than HWA, BET and BSE in 1.5 T and 3 T scans ( p < 0.05, all tests). HWA and MAPS were found to be best at including all brain tissues (median false negative rate ≤ 0.010% for 1.5 T scans and ≤ 0.019% for 3 T scans, both methods). The median Jaccard index of MAPS were similar in both 1.5 T and 3 T scans, whereas those of BET, BSE and HWA were higher in 1.5 T scans than 3 T scans (p < 0.05, all tests). We found that the diagnostic group had a small effect on the median Jaccard index of all four methods. In conclusion, MAPS had relatively high accuracy and low variability compared to HWA, BET and BSE in MR scans with and without atrophy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: Malformations of the cerebral cortex may be associated with severe epilepsy and status epilepticus. It has been shown that status epilepticus models induce excitotoxic cell death. In humans, very few data are available. Case and results: We report a case of a multifocal disorder of the lamination diagnosed in a neonate, borne at 30 weeks’ gestation, who died from a refractory status epilepticus at two months and half. This abnormality was not detected by repeated MRI studies. Only microscopic investigations permitted to identify this disorder of the lamination. We found also little cell death or cell loss. Discussion: Our report highlights the possible false negative results of MRI in a newborn. We can also discuss that immature human brain maybe less sensitive to neuronal injury than mature as described in animal models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Subcortical infarcts are most commonly the consequence of perforating artery occlusion and pure motor deficit is the most frequent syndrome resulting from an interruption of the corticospinal tract at the level of the corona radiate, the internal capsule or the brainstem. Motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring is used as an adjunct to surgery as somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) have been found to be insensitive to these lesions. Two different techniques have been used for monitoring MEPs during aneurysm surgery: transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS). TES may result in patient movement, interfering with microdissection. There is also concern that TES MEP may not detect subcortical motor pathway ischemia by stimulating deeper subcortical structures and may thereby bypass the ischemic area. DCS produces focal muscle activation, less movement and more superficial stimulation that should detect cortical and superficial subcortical ischemia, hence avoiding false-negatives. However, this technique also has disadvantages including subdural bleeding and injury to the brain. Using close-to-motor-threshold stimulation and focal stimulating electrode montages, TES and DCS MEPs do not vary significantly in their capacity to detect lesions of the motor cortex or its efferent pathways. Both techniques are prone to interference by anesthetic agents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: Scientific literature on stalking behaviors is not sufficiently uniform and shows no clear definition of the theorical construct of stalking. In order to respond to current scientific criteria for defining a psychological and behavioral construct, the definition of "stalking" should be exhaustive and specific at the same time. There must be also a positive consensus by scholars on a definition of a construct, for that definition becoming operationalized and therefore profitably applicable in theory and research. Methods: Exploring the theoretical definitions of stalking that are privileged in current literature, and reviewing the different behavioral markers suggested for identifying the construct, this article analyzes the multifaceted characteristics of stalking behaviors. The review of literature was based on international database of peer-reviewed articles (Psychinfo, ProQuest, Psycharticles) as well as authoritative Italian and international books on the topic, and it allowed to detect specific categories of behaviors enacted by a stalker against his or her victim. These categories include both the most violent acts (such as physical and sexual assaults, threats and harassments), which are ever considered as disturbing, and the less violent, more silent and intrusive, stalking behaviors. Some stalking behaviors are in fact most difficult to detect, and victims often misinterpret such behaviors as a simple search for intimacy by the stalker: this easily leads to "false negatives", in research terms, while practically results in the victim missing the chance to protect him- or herself from the stalker. The article also highlights potential motivation and drives underlying different stalking behaviors, and it explores the specific aims pursued by different typologies of stalkers in relation to their victim. The information on stalking behaviors were ultimately discussed emphasizing the direction of future researches and suggesting the development of appropriate strategies for prevention, intervention and harm reduction related to such disturbing behaviors. Results: This review of the international literature concerning the behaviors of stalkers leads to an operational definition of stalking. "Stalking" consists in an interpersonal behavior characterized by threats or harassment toward a specific victim; it has relational purposes, it is repeated over time and/or it results particularly intense, and it is perceived as disturbing by the victim of such behaviors. This definition seems comprehensive enough to encompass the entire range of stalking behaviors and it is not limited only to the behaviours of romantic stalkers; at the same time, this definition should result detailed enough to be operationalized in theoretical and empirical reasearches on the construct. The discussion of stalkers' typology based on their possible motivation could be further useful for future reasearch, opening the doors toward new promising directions. Conclusions: A review of the national and international literature on stalking behaviors shows that still are present some uncertainties on this topic, and a lack of scientific exactness in relation to the construct, but it allows anyway to develop more exhaustive and at the same time comprehensive definition of "stalking", which are particularly needed for research and theory in this field. The definition proposed in this article could perhaps patch a little such a big hole. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The first concern regarding the study is the ethnic difference regarding the cutoff point of the PHQ-9. Second, there was no significant difference between receiver operating characteristic curves for two levels of depression between the PHQ-9 and the Beck Depression Inventory. The PHQ-9 as a screening tool should be used carefully to avoid false-negative judgment. Further analyses with a large enough number of subjects are needed before using PHQ as a valid screening tool.

Abstract = {Objective: Lack of self-esteem may play an important role in the development of eating disorders (ED). This study investigated the differential impact of positive and negative feedback on implicit and explicit self-esteem in women with an ED (N = 25) as compared to women without an ED (N = 29). Method: False feedback (positive or negative) was given on participant’s performance on a specifically developed intellectual test. Before and after the performance, explicit and implicit self-esteem was measured. Results: On the explicit measure ED patients reacted congruently with the nature of the feedback. On the implicit measure only ED patients responded to the positive feedback with an improvement of self-esteem, with no effect for negative feedback. The control group was unaffected by either feedback. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the explicit and implicit measures, a finding suggesting that these measurements tap different constructs. Conclusion: Positive feedback affects implicit self-esteem of female patients with eating disorders. The results underline the importance of positively approaching women with ED.

Abstract = {A total of 979 Chinese college students were recruited in order to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen (CSOGS). The C-SOGS was internally consistent and correlated with gambling-related problems and negative mental health status. Results of likelihood ratios (LRs) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve supported the C-SOGS as a valid screening instrument for probable pathological gambling. Using the DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling, the conventional cut score of 5 on the C-SOGS showed satisfactory sensitivity, specificity and false negative rates. This cut score identified 85% of the true positives and 95% of the true negatives. In general, the C-SOGS overestimated the number of pathological gamblers relative to DSM-IV criteria. Future research on Chinese gambling should build on current empirical work on the SOGS to refine the C-SOGS for use with Chinese populations.

Abstract = {Diagnosing past hypomania is a difficult task. Current structured interviews (e.g. CIDI, SCID) limit the ability to probe for hypomania. A modified SCID Hypomania Module was published by us (Benazzi and Akiskal, J Affect Disord 2003; Akiskal and Benazzi, J Clin Psychiatry 2005) in order to overcome the limitations of structured interviewing. Our papers outlined the framework of the modified SCID. In response to requests from many readers of this journal and other clinicians and investigators, we are hereby providing a more explicit step-by-step phenomenologic probing interview. DSM-IV criteria have to be met, but the probing for hypomania is very different from that of the SCID. All past hypomanic symptoms are assessed. No negative meaning is given to symptoms, as hypomania often improves functioning and it is seen by patients as a state of well being. The first step is probing for overactivity (increase in goal-directed activity), because observable behaviors are easier to remember by patients and key informants. There is no gold-standard for overactivity: each person becomes his/her own standard to ‘measure’ a clear-cut departure form the usual behavior. Questions, correspondingly, can change from patient to patient. The emotions associated with behavioral change are easier to be remembered than asking them first, as in the structured interviews. Structured interviews have mood change (elation, irritability) as stem question (corresponding to the criterion A of DSM-IV, which postulates that it must always be present). However, apart from a likely recall bias of past emotions, the description of mood change appears more or less negative in structured interviews (to increase specificity but by much reducing sensitivity, i.e. the false-negatives). Presenting mood change as simply having been more elated/irritable than usual can easily be interpreted as normal mood fluctuations, while presenting mood change as much more than usual could be understood as a severe mental disorder. Both ways are likely to lead to a negative response, moving the interviewers to unipolar disorders (the skip-out instruction). Our modified SCID is a fully semi-structured interview: many questions are asked about each symptom to make the question understandable according to each patient, and, very importantly, examples of the ‘events’ are systematically asked to check understanding and clinical relevance. Our interview follows DSM-IV criteria (apart from the minimum duration, 2 days versus DSM-IV 4 days), i.e. mood change must always been present, but our probing detects more hypomanic episodes than the SCID.

When a patient complains of pain, a bone scan and/or plain x-rays are ordered as investigations. X-rays necessitate a 1-cm diameter mass and 50% bone mineral loss at minimum for detection. Up to 40% of lesions will be unidentified by x-rays, presenting false-negative results. Computed tomography (CT) scans can recognize a bony metastatic lesion up to 6 months earlier than an x-ray. However, plain x-rays can also lead to rare false-positive results. We present a case with a false-positive result in a patient with lung cancer.

Abstract = {Cervical spinal cord displacements have recently been measured in relation to the cardiac cycle, substantiating that cord motion in this region reduces both the sensitivity and reproducibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord (spinal fMRI). Given the ubiquitous and complex nature of this motion, cardiac gating alone is not expected to sufficiently remove these errors, whereas current modeling approaches for spin-echo methods are not specific to motion artifacts, potentially eliminating function-related data along with components of motion-related noise. As such, we have developed an alternative approach to spinal cord motion-compensation, using retrospective spinal cord motion time-course estimates (RESPITE) to forecast a small number of physiological noise regressors. These are generated from the principal components of spinal cord motion, as well as subject-specific cardiac data, and are subsequently included in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. With this approach, the components of motion-related signal fluctuation are modeled, along with functionally-relevant signal changes (i.e., those components fitting the stimulus paradigm), to account for the effects of spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) motion in a thorough, yet discerning, manner. By analyzing 100 previously acquired half-Fourier turbo spin-echo (HASTE) spinal fMRI data sets, along with a collection of null-task data, we show that the implementation of RESPITE reduces the occurrence of both type I (false-positive) and type II (false negative) errors, effectively increasing the specificity (5–6%) and sensitivity (15–20%) to neuronal activity.

Abstract = {Objective: To identify the optimal test protocol to screen for hearing problems in newborns, an evaluation of three distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) protocols was conducted in neonates, from a well-baby nursery (WBN) and from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and compared to the performance in newborns of a more standard protocol based on transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs). Methods: The DPOAE protocols used asymmetrical stimulus intensities (L₁ > L₂ ) with a frequency ratio of 1.22, in the following format: (P1), L₁ = 60, L₂ = 50 dB SPL; (P2), L₁ = 65, L₂ = 55 dB SPL, and (P3), L₁ = 75, L₂ = 65 dB SPL. Linear TEOAE responses, evoked by click stimuli of 75 dB peSPL, were used as controls of normal cochlear function. Five frequencies at 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 kHz were tested with a common commercially available macro-based software subroutine (Otodynamics Corp, ILO-92). The project evaluated the responses from 1200 WBN infants (average age 48 h) and 350 low-birth-weight NICU infants, all randomly selected. Results: Statistical analyses comparing the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), at the predefined f 2 frequencies, indicated that the P1 and P2 DPOAE protocols generated similar responses. Significant S/N differences were observed in the P3 to P2 dataset comparisons. DPOAE scoring criteria were estimated from the P3 dataset using a one-sided, distribution-free confidence intervals. The scoring criteria for a ‘pass’ were estimated as a minimum S/N of 6.0, 7.0 and 6.0 dB at 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 kHz, respectively. In terms of feasibility, the P3 protocol generated responses in 98% of the WBN and 94.8% of the NICU infants. Conclusions: All three DPOAE protocols demonstrated shorter time-recording requirements than the standard TEOAE test. The false-positive and false-negative rates for the NICU infants were estimated as 0.0028 and 0.003%, respectively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Concern is building about high rates of schizophrenia in large cities, and among immigrants, cannabis users, and traumatized individuals, some of which likely reflects the causal influence of environmental exposures. This, in combination with very slow progress in the area of molecular genetics, has generated interest in more complicated models of schizophrenia etiology that explicitly posit gene-environment interactions (EU-GEI. European Network of Schizophrenia Networks for the Study of Gene Environment Interactions. Schizophrenia aetiology: do gene-environment interactions hold the key? [published online ahead of print April 25, 2008] Schizophr Res; S0920-9964(08) 00170-9). Although findings of epidemiological gene-environment interaction (G × E) studies are suggestive of widespread gene-environment interactions in the etiology of schizophrenia, numerous challenges remain. For example, attempts to identify gene-environment interactions cannot be equated with molecular genetic studies with a few putative environmental variables "thrown in": G × E is a multidisciplinary exercise involving epidemiology, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging, pharmacology, biostatistics, and genetics. Epidemiological G × E studies using indirect measures of genetic risk in genetically sensitive designs have the advantage that they are able to model the net, albeit nonspecific, genetic load. In studies using direct molecular measures of genetic variation, a hypothesis-driven approach postulating synergistic effects between genes and environment impacting on a final common pathway, such as "sensitization" of mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, while simplistic, may provide initial focus and protection against the numerous false-positive and false-negative results that these investigations engender. Experimental ecogenetic approaches with randomized assignment may help to overcome some of the limitations of observational studies and allow for the additional elucidation of underlying mechanisms using a combination of functional enviromics and functional genomics.

Abstract = {Statistical tests of heterogeneity and bias, in particular publication bias, are very popular in meta-analyses. These tests use statistical approaches whose limitations are often not recognized. Moreover, it is often implied with inappropriate confidence that these tests can provide reliable answers to questions that in essence are not of statistical nature. Statistical heterogeneity is only a correlate of clinical and pragmatic heterogeneity and the correlation may sometimes be weak. Similarly, statistical signals may hint to bias, but seen in isolation they cannot fully prove or disprove bias in general, let alone specific causes of bias, such as publication bias in particular. Both false-positive and false-negative signals of heterogeneity and bias can be common and their prevalence may be anticipated based on some rational considerations. Here I discuss the major common challenges and flaws that emerge in using and interpreting statistical tests of heterogeneity and bias in meta-analyses. I discuss misinterpretations that can occur at the level of statistical inference, clinical/pragmatic inference and specific cause attribution. Suggestions are made on how to avoid these flaws, use these tests properly and learn from them. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {[¹⁸F]MPPF PET has previously been used to identify the epileptic lobe in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients at the group level. This study aims to validate the visual analysis of [₁₈F]MPPF PET in the assessment of individual TLE patients for their suitability to undergo temporal lobe resection. Forty-two patients suffering from TLE and 18 control subjects matched for age and gender were prospectively enrolled for [¹⁸F]MPPF PET. Four subtypes were defined according to the presurgical evaluation: mesio-TLE (MTLE, 32 patients), temporal neocortical epilepsy (NC, five patients), temporo-perisylvian epilepsy (T+, three patients) and temporal epilepsy without further information (t, two patients). Parametric binding potential (BPND) images were obtained using a simplified reference tissue model. Three examiners, who were blinded to other data, visually interpreted each scan and delineated areas of decreased [¹⁸F]MPPF BPND. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis of MPPF BPND images was also performed. Visual analysis showed a low rate of disagreement between the three examiners (7%). PET scans were considered normal in four patients (9.5%). In the remaining 38 patients (90.5%), areas of focal BPND decrease were identified. A specific pattern was encountered in the MTLE subgroup, consisting of a BPND decrease involving hippocampus, amygdala and temporal pole altogether. Combining the results from the presurgical investigations and the surgical outcome, we estimated that the area of BPND decrease coincided with the epileptogenic zone in 40% of patients in the MTLE subgroup and 33% in the other TLE subtypes. This relatively low precision was due to 47% of patients who showed BPND decreases in the insula ipsilateral to the epileptogenic lobe. The SPM analysis had much lower sensitivity (67%) to detect BPND decreases in the epileptogenic temporal lobe, but revealed areas of increased BPND outside the epileptogenic zone and bitemporal BPND decreases of undetermined clinical significance, which were undetectable by visual analysis, in 29% of patients. In conclusion, visual analysis of [¹⁸F]MPPF BPND images helps in the correct identification of the epileptogenic temporal lobe in all patients showing BPND decreases, with a false negative rate inferior to 10% and no false positives in control subjects. All TLE patients with [¹⁸F]MPPF BPND decreases involving hippocampus, amygdala and temporal pole together, with or without extension to the ipsilateral insula, were good candidates for anterior temporal lobectomy. All these patients became seizure free after surgery, even when the clinical presentation was not that of a typical MTLE, or when MRI failed to detect hippocampal atrophy.

Mangan et al. (see record [rid]2008-12627-004[/rid]) field study of the Quadri-Track Zone Comparison Technique in Physiology & Behavior, are based largely on dated articles that examined control question polygraph techniques whose psychological test structures, physiological analyses, and scoring systems are significantly different than those of the Quadri-Track ZCT. Iacono and Verschuere et al. alleged that the Quadri-Track ZCT is biased against the innocent and can be defeated with the use of countermeasures without considering the technique's unique "remedial inside track" that quantifies the innocent examinee's fear of error--and the guilty examinee's hope of error--which are factored into the overall score, thus avoiding false positive and false negative errors. Their objection to the use of confessions as the criterion for ground truth presumes that the polygraph examinations conducted in this field study were conducted in a vacuum. They ignored the various methods of post-test confirmation and research studies that support the use of confessions as ground truth. Verschuere et al. cited the National Research Council's 2003 report to support their conviction that the accuracy of polygraph tests is well below perfection and errors often occur. However, they failed to mention that the accuracy range values of the seven field studies which met the National Research Council's scientific criteria were from 0.711 to 0.999 with a median value of 0.89, and that the field study with the highest accuracy (0.999) was from a published 1989 field study on the Quadri-Track Zone Comparison Technique.

Abstract = {In this article I caution against the use of polygraph testing in convicted sex-offenders programs. First, I explain that the prevalent method of polygraph testing, the CQT, suffers from several major flaws and has no scientific basis. These flaws, which characterize all usages of the CQT, including its use with sex offenders, create a considerable risk for false positive as well as false-negative errors. Second, no methodologically sound research examining the validity of the CQT, neither in its forensic application, nor in its use with sex offenders has been conducted. Finally, I explain why the use of CQT polygraphy with sex offenders is even more problematic than its common use as an aid in criminal investigations. Clearly, rehabilitation programs of convicted sex offenders are highly important, but the use of polygraph testing in this context is misguided and instead of reducing recidivism in sex offenders is likely to achieve just the opposite.

Abstract = {The current study was designed to investigate children's memory and suggestibility for events differing in valence (positive or negative) and veracity (true or false). A total of 82 3- and 5-year-olds were asked repeated questions about true and false events, either in a grouped order (i.e., all questions about a certain event asked consecutively) or in a nongrouped order (i.e., questions about a certain event were interspersed with questions about other events). Interviewer gender was also varied. Individual differences, including attachment style, inhibition, and behavioral adjustment, were examined as potential predictors of memory and suggestibility. Results revealed significant age, valence, and veracity effects on children's memory reports. Path analysis demonstrated that individual differences in behavioral problems and inhibitory ability predicted children's provision of inaccurate information. Implications for psychological theory and legal application are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The theory of reasoned action (TRA) was used to estimate adolescents' vulnerability to inhalant abuse, operationalized by intentions to use or avoid inhalants. The model correctly differentiated 78% of all respondents (N = 596). A second analysis highlighted variables that discriminated properly identified from misclassified youth. False positives, those defined as being at-risk, but who repudiated inhalants, were significantly less likely than their at-risk peers to have used inhalants; they used inhalants and marijuana less frequently; were monitored more closely by parents; and were less rebellious (all p < .05). False negatives, defined as not at-risk, but who had not unequivocally rejected inhalants, were significantly more likely than their similarly classed peers to have used inhalants and marijuana, and to have used both more frequently; also, they were less highly acculturated. This study reaffirmed the utility of the TRA and underscored factors that might improve classification accuracy. This approach may facilitate prevention efforts, and may be extrapolated to any context in which risk categorization is used as a basis for prevention or amelioration.

Abstract = {This paper investigates the net benefit of mammography. A theoretical expected utility (EU) model shows that increases in breast cancer risk, decreases in false-negative and false-positive rates, decreases in cost and increases/decreases in quality of life with early/late-stage breast cancer increase the net benefit of mammography. The theoretical findings are tested in an empirical analysis using Canadian data. The empirical results are broadly consistent with the EU hypothesis. Results suggest that women at higher risk are more likely to obtain a mammogram. In particular, individuals are significantly more likely to have had a time-appropriate mammogram if the mother's cause of death was breast cancer, and if the sister had breast cancer. The results also show that older age (related to higher risk and more accurate mammograms) increases mammography use, and that decreases in time and opportunity costs, and better health behaviours generally have the same effect.

Abstract = {Background and purpose: To evaluate the prediction of nocturnal central sleep apnoea (CSA) syndrome from the presence of periodic breathing (PB) on diurnal monitoring of pre-exercise (cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPX]) parameters. CSA syndrome is commonly found in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients and has several prognostic and therapeutic implications but is frequently undiagnosed. Awake PB pattern is sometimes observed during the CPX cardiopulmonary monitoring period of gas exchanges in CHF patients referred to the stress test laboratory for routine peak VO₂ determination. Patients and methods: Forty-five consecutive ambulatory patients (2 women/43 men; 60.2 ± 11.7 years old) with clinically moderate to severe CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II/III: 22/23; mean ± standard deviation left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: 30.5 ± 6.6%) underwent a classical maximal CPX test including a 2-min period (pre-test) of gas exchange monitoring and nocturnal ambulatory polygraphic monitoring. PB was defined when a cyclical pattern of VE, VO₂, VCO₂, was visually noted during the pre-exercise period and/or during the first 4 min of the CPX. CSA syndrome was retained as a central apnoea-plus-hypopnea index (cAHI) equal to or more than 10/h. The sleep study scoring procedure was done independently of the knowledge of the CPX results. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was constructed. Results: Peak VO₂ reached 16.4 ± 5.2 mL kg-1 min-1 (55% of the theoretical value adjusted for gender and age). The polygraphy was completed and validated (at least five consecutive hours of sleep) in all cases. CSA syndrome was found in 28 (62%) patients (mean cAHI: 19.3 ± 8.6/h). Sensitivity for the prediction of CSA syndrome reached 92.9% (two false-negative patients with a cAHI of nine) and specificity 94.1% with a predictive accuracy of 93.3%. The only false-positive patient suffered a moderate but significant obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Using ROC curve analysis, the W value reached 0.99 for the prediction of CSA from the presence of PB. The presence of CSA syndrome, using logistic regression analysis, is associated with a more severe functional status (NYHA: p < 0.01, peak VO₂: p < 0.002), a lower basal and peak end-expiratory CO₂ pressure (PETCO₂, all p < 0.03), a worse LVEF (p < 0.01) and age equal to or more than 60 years (p < 0.03). Conclusions: The observation of PB in the preliminary period of the CPX test in CHF patients appeared highly predictive of the presence of CSA syndrome during sleep and could prompt the use of polygraphic monitoring in severe CHF patients.

Abstract = {Several previous studies have demonstrated that children, when compared with adults, exhibit both lower levels of veridical memory and fewer intrusions when given semantically associated lists. However, researchers have drawn these conclusions using semantically associated word lists that were normed with adults, which may not lead to the same level of activation or gist generation in children. In the current study, the authors used similar associative word lists normed with children and then evaluated the memory of children and adults using these newly normed lists as well as the typical adult-normed lists. Results indicate that children showed lower true and false memories with both the child-normed and adult-normed lists. Thus, these data suggest that the negative relationship between age and false memories in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM; J. Deese, 1959; H. L. Roediger & K. B. McDermott, 1995) paradigm is not an artifact of the age group used to construct the lists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Although psychiatric patients have a shortened life expectancy due to increased coronary heart disease (CHD), early identification of high-risk patients and targeted prevention for reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are suboptimal in clinical care. We aimed to compare the accuracy of a single LDL-cholesterol intervention threshold of > 130 mg/dL (recently proposed for psychiatric patients) with that of the more complex LDL-cholesterol targets defined by the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP), The study was performed in patients receiving second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), a medication class associated with CHD risk. Method: Three hundred fifty-six psychiatric patients receiving SGAs underwent standard LDL-cholesterol target assessments upon admission to the hospital between August 1, 2004, and March 1, 2005. The expert consensus-recommended > 130-mg/dL LDL-cholesterol threshold was used to determine false-negative results among patients with above-target NCEP-defined LDL cholesterol and false-positive results in the group with below-target NCEP-defined LDL cholesterol. Results: The > 130-mg/dL threshold misclassified 15 (14.9%) of 101 high-risk patients and 31 (12.2%) of 255 low-risk patients (mean ± SD . 10-year CHD risk: 23.1% + 12.2% and 2.1% ± 2.2%, respectively). Results were similar in the 171 schizophrenia patients. Misclassified patients with above-target LDL cholesterol were more likely than correctly identified patients to have diabetes (p = .0002), greater 10-year CHD risk (p = .0006), higher age (p = .0008), metabolic syndrome (p = .0018), and past CHD events (p = .0025). No distinguishing factors for false-positive cases could be identified. Conclusions: The > 130-mg/dL LDL-cholesterol intervention threshold operated poorly in our psychiatric population. To avoid substandard care, NCEP-defined LDL-cholesterol targets should be used for the routine detection of psychiatric patients treated with antipsychotics who require interventions to decrease CHD risk.

Abstract = {Few studies have focused on the validity of the ADI-R and ADOS in the assessment of preschool children with developmental delay. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic validity of the ADI-R and the ADOS in young children. Two-hundred and nine children aged 20-55 months participated in the study, 120 of whom received a diagnosis of autism. ADI-R and ADOS diagnostic classifications were compared to consensus clinical diagnoses. Children with a clinical diagnosis of autism scored significantly higher on all algorithm domains of the ADI-R and ADOS. The ADOS performed better than the ADI-R in comparison to consensus clinical diagnosis. Characteristics of the ADI-R and ADOS false positive and false negative cases are explored. Further research is recommended in terms of examining which items of the ADI-R best predict a diagnosis of autism for very young children with developmental problems.

Abstract = {To assess performance and processes in collective and individual memory, participants watched two job candidates on video. Beforehand, half the participants were told they would be tested on their memory of the interviews, and the other half were asked to make a decision to hire one of the candidates. Afterwards, participants completed a recognition memory task in either a group or individual condition. Groups had better recognition memory than individuals. Individuals made more false positives than false negatives and groups exaggerated this. Post-hoc analysis found that groups only exaggerated the tendency towards false positives on items that reflected negatively on the job candidate. There was no significant difference between instruction conditions. When reaching consensus on the recognition task, groups tended to choose the correct answer if at least two members had the correct answer. This method of consensus is discussed as a factor in groups' superior memory performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Automatic methods developed to detect transient EEG events during sleep may present a degree of arbitrariness in the choice of appropriate channels or amplitude thresholds for the analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-channel and temporal coincidences approach. Methods: A two-step automatic detection (AD) of peculiar transient synchronized EEG events (TE) was performed in stage 2 and stage 3 sleep periods obtained from 10 normal sleep recordings and included: (a) detection of candidate TE from all the EEG traces and averaged signals, based on amplitude thresholds selections in both the time and frequency domains; (b) cross-checking of TE by evaluation of the coincidences in different EEG traces. TE found by AD but not confirmed by visual analysis (false positives, FP) and TE evidenced by visual analysis and missed by AD (false negatives, FN) were then counted. Results: AD performed in averaged signals significantly reduced the number of FP but slightly increased FN, compared to single-channel analysis. However, when TE were confirmed by inter-channel temporal coincidences, a significant reduction of total errors (FN + FP) was achieved. The minimum error was obtained after C3-A2 and C4-A1 averaging and signal cross-checking with at least three channels (C3-A2 or C4-A1, plus both O1-A2 and O2-A1). Conclusions: This study describes a novel method for automatic detection of transient EEG events occurring during sleep that takes into account all the available channels. Significance: This approach reduces the need of human supervision and may overcome most of the difficulties encountered by automatic methods based on single-channel analysis.

The Twenty Questions was shown to possess high reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha. Concurrent, convergent and predictive validity of the 20Q supported the use of this instrument as an acceptable screening instrument. Classification analyses indicated that the 20Q is comparable to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling in specificity, sensitivity and rates of false negatives and false positives.

Abstract = {The DSM’s major-depression "bereavement exclusion" eliminates bereavement-related depressive episodes (BRDs) from diagnosis unless they are "complicated" by prolonged duration or certain severe symptoms. The exclusion was substantially narrowed in DSM-IV to decrease false-negative diagnoses, but the impact of this change remains unknown. We divided BRDs in the National Comorbidity Survey into uncomplicated versus complicated categories using broader DSM-III-R and narrower DSM-IV exclusion criteria. Using 6 pathology validators (symptom number, melancholic depression, suicide attempt, interference with life, medication for depression, and hospitalization for depression), we compared the validity of the 2 exclusion criteria sets using 2 tests: (1) which criteria set yielded less pathological uncomplicated cases or more pathological complicated cases; (2) which yielded the largest separation between uncomplicated and complicated pathology levels. Results of both tests indicated that the narrower DSM-IV criteria substantially decreased the exclusion’s validity. These results suggest caution regarding the current proposal to eliminate the bereavement exclusion in DSM-5. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In two experiments, we manipulated the controllability and stability of causes of failure and explored the impact of these factors on self-efficacy and performance. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 80; mean age 20.0 years, s = 1.0) were provided with false negative feedback following performance on a blindfolded dart-throwing task. Consistent with theory and recent research, an induced belief that failure was beyond control and unlikely to change led to lower self-efficacy and poorer performance (all F1,75 > 5.49, all P < 0.05, all η² = 0.01). A second experiment (N = 80; mean age 22.0 years, s = 2.1) demonstrated that following an induced belief that failure was beyond control and unlikely to change, only new perceptions that a repeated failure was within one's control and likely to change resulted in higher self-efficacy and improved performance (all F1,75 > 4.53, all P < 0.05, all η² > 0.004). All effects were mediated by self-efficacy: Sobel's (1982) test, all z > 1.97 (in absolute magnitude), all P < 0.05, all r > 0.22 (in absolute magnitude). These findings suggest that in novel circumstances individuals believe in the best for themselves unless possibilities to self-enhance are explicitly precluded, and only reinvest efforts when opportunities for self-enhancement become clearly admissible.

Abstract = {One of the most common compulsions in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is repeated checking. Although individuals often report that they check to become more certain, checking has been shown to have the opposite effect - increased checking causes increased uncertainty. However, checking may also be thought of as beginning because of memory uncertainty. Beliefs about responsibility, over-estimation of threat, intolerance of uncertainty, perfectionism, and importance of and control of thoughts are already known to affect different aspects of OCD symptomatology. Beliefs about memory, however, are not currently considered to influence compulsive behaviour. In the current study, beliefs about memory were manipulated to test whether or not they affected urges to check. Ninety-one undergraduate participants received (positive or negative) false feedback about their performance on aspects of a standardized memory test, and then completed two additional memory tasks. Their urges to check following these tasks were assessed. Consistent with our hypotheses, individuals in the low memory confidence condition had greater urges to check following the memory tasks than those in the high memory confidence condition, demonstrating that manipulations of beliefs about memory can influence checking. Results and implications are discussed in terms of cognitive-behavioural models of and treatments for OCD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The aim of spike sorting is to reconstruct single unit spike times from extracellular multi-unit recordings. Failure in the identification of a spike (false negative) or assignment of a spike to a wrong unit (false positive) are typical examples of sorting errors. Their influence on cross-correlation measures has been addressed and it has been shown that correlation analysis of multi-unit signals may lead to incorrect interpretations. We formulate a model to study the influence of sorting errors on the significance of synchronized spikes, and thus are able to study if and how the significance changes in case of imperfect sorting. Here we explore the case of pair-wise analysis of simultaneously recorded neurons. Interestingly, a decrease in the significance is observed in the presence of false positives, as well as for false negatives. Furthermore, false negative errors reduce the significance of synchronized spikes more strongly than false positives. Thus, conservative sorting strategies have a stronger tendency to lead to a loss of the significance of synchronization. We demonstrate that a detailed understanding of sorting techniques and their possible effects on subsequent data analyses is important in order to rule out inconsistencies in the interpretation of results.

Abstract = {The difference between test accuracy and predictive accuracy is presented and defined. The failure to distinguish between these two types of measures is shown to have led to a misguided debate over the interpretation of prevalence estimates. The distinction between test accuracy defined as sensitivity and specificity, and predictive accuracy defined as positive and negative predictive value is shown to reflect the choice of the denominator used to calculate true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative rates. It is further shown that any instrument will tend to overestimate prevalence in low base rate populations and underestimate it in those populations where prevalence is high. The implications of these observations are then discussed in terms of the need to define diagnostic thresholds that have clinical and policy relevance.

Positive tests of initial urinalysis using fluorescence polarization immunoassay were further confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In a total of 1502 patients interviewed, 632 (42%) also provided a urine sample. Among those with urine samples, the positive rate of urinalysis was 1.4% for amphetamine-type drugs and 1.6% for opiates. Among those with positive urinalysis, a false-negative rate ranged from 66.6% for amphetamines to 70.0% for opiates. Meanwhile, all the self-reported current uses of either amphetamines or opiates were confirmed by urinalysis. The results indicate that the false-negative rates of questionnaire-based, self-reported current use of illicit drug are around two thirds and the false-positive rates are negligible, which might be useful for the calibration of estimates from epidemiological surveys.

Abstract = {The negative effects of false information presented either prior to (proactive interference; PI) or following (retroactive interference; RI) true information was examined with word definitions (Experiment 1) and trivia facts (Experiment 2). Participants were explicitly aware of which information was true and false when shown, and true-false discrimination was evaluated via multiple-choice tests. Negative suggestion, defined as poorer performance on interference items than noninterference (control) items, consistently occurred when the wrong information followed the correct information (RI) but not when it preceded the correct information (PI). These effects did not change as a function of retention interval (immediate, 1 week, or 3 weeks) or number of incorrect alternatives (1 or 3). Implications of this outcome for experiencing incorrect information in both academic and nonacademic situations are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aims: Assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of two commercially available 'drug-facilitated sexual assault' drug detector kits, Drink Guard and Drink Detective. Design: Experimental. Setting: Laboratory. Measurements: Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) sodium salt, ketamine hydrochloride, temazepam, flunitrazepam and diazepam were dissolved (Tween added to benzodiazepine solutions) as separate stock solutions and added to 330 ml samples of cola (Pepsi Max®), beer (Stella Artois®), 'alcopop' (Bacardi Breezer®) and placebo (distilled water). The doses used are reported to be common in cases of intoxication. Each kit was tested 10 times for each drink/drug combination. Two blind, independent observers scored each test (presence/absence of drug) in accordance with kit instructions; χ² was used to compare the proportion of times raters scored tests correctly and incorrectly. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated overall, for each drink, and sensitivity was calculated for each drug. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated using the kappa statistic. Findings: While both raters were able to score significantly more tests correctly than incorrectly using Drink Detective, and one rater scored similarly using Drink Guard, the overall sensitivity of Drink Detective and Drink Guard was 69.0% (95% CI 64.2-73.5%) and 37.5% (95% CI 30.1-45.5%), respectively. Sensitivity was drink-dependent. Drink Detective was unable to detect our dose of GHB in water, with all tests scored negatively by both raters for this drink/drug combination (n = 20 negative scores). Overall, specificity was 76.6% (95% CI 71.5-81.0%) and 87.9% (95% CI 83.0-91.6%) for Drink Guard and Drink Detective, respectively, but was affected by the beverage. Inter-rater agreement was poor for Drink Guard (kappa = 0.278 ± 0.069) but excellent for Drink Detective (kappa = 0.894 ± 0.245). Inter-observer agreement was drug-dependent. Conclusions: Use of drug detector kits by the public in the night-time environment needs further investigation and may create a false sense of security (false negatives) and undue concern (false positives) among kit users.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the impact of assumptions about prevalence or prior clinical probability of bipolar disorder on the clinical performance (predictive values) of diagnostic screening tests. Method: Sensitivity and specificity data from four reports on two bipolar screening instruments (the Mood Disorders Questionnaire and the Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale) were used to calculate positive and negative predictive values at varying prevalence levels. Bayesian statistical concepts were employed. Results: At low prevalence or low prior clinical probability, the sensitivity and specificity of the test have little impact on negative predictive value; the tests perform well, with low risk of false negatives. Similarly, at low prevalence or low prior clinical probability, positive predictive values are low regardless of which sensitivity and specificity data are used: the risk of false positives is substantial. Conclusions: At lower prevalence or prior probabilities, as in the community or primary care setting, these screening tests can rule out bipolarity (when patients have insight into their symptoms), but do not effectively rule it in. Clinicians' estimates of prior probability have as much, or in many cases more, impact on the clinical performance of the bipolar screening tools than the tests' sensitivity and specificity. To improve the performance of screening tools, the primary emphasis needs to be placed on improving clinicians' skill at recognizing clinical and historical features of bipolar diagnosis.

Abstract = {The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a parent report screening measure for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). To examine its validity in a young sample, the SCQ was given to parents of 151 children at a mean age of 5 years, before assessment in tertiary autism or preschool clinics. Overall sensitivity was .71, the same for both clinics, but specificity was better for the preschool clinic (.62) than for the autism clinic (.53) reflecting fewer false-positives in the former. The "hit rate" was 65% with 28% of the children with autism missed by the SCQ at a cutoff score of 15 (false-negatives) and 38% of the nonautistic misidentified as having an ASD (false-positives). Item validity analysis, contrary to what was previously published, indicated that only 15 or 46% of the items distinguished between children with and without ASD in this much younger sample. False-negatives were somewhat higher functioning. The SCQ would seem to be a useful tool for identifying young children in need of further assessment and assisting in routing them to the appropriate clinic, especially if used in conjunction with a screening by a community professional. There remain questions about the "best" cutoff score to use and whether a shorter version, based on the items that distinguished autistic from nonautistic, would be more reliable and valid with younger children. Furthermore, it may be that an adjusted score is required when parents omit items or with nonverbal children who cannot be scored on some of the items.

Abstract = {In this article we apply research in the field of judgment and decision making to the policy of preemption. We use Brunswik's lens model to frame the policy of preemption as the integration of multiple fallible indicators under conditions of uncertainty. We use the Taylor-Russell diagram to demonstrate how the policy of preemption increases judgment uncertainty and error. The continuation of a policy of preemption will inevitably lead to an increase in false positives (mistaken military engagements), an increase in tension and dispute among U.S. allies (and foes) over these engagements, and a growing world perception that the United States is an aggressor nation. Post-9/11 policymakers and the public are explicitly focused on reducing false negatives at the implicit cost of increasing false positives. Greater appreciation of the inverse relationship between false positives and false negatives is needed to understand the consequences of the policy of preemption.

Abstract = {Myasthenia gravis is a rare, auto-immune disorder of the neuromuscular junction. Onset signs frequently involve ocular muscles, accounting for ptosis and/or diplopia in more than 75% of cases. Among the cases with purely ocular muscle involvement, less than one half will never progress towards a more general form of myasthenia. However, even if they do not share the potentially life-threatening course of generalized myasthenia, purely ocular forms are often responsible for severe impairment in everyday life. The diagnosis is essentially based on fluctuations in the time and topography of the ocular muscle weakness. It still remains uneasy, as investigations such as electromyography, search for antiacetycholine receptor antibodies (positive in 50% of cases of purely ocular myasthenia), and edrophonium chloride test sometimes yield false negative results. Whereas some patients get better while on anticholinesterasic drugs alone, most of them will experience insufficient improvement and need steroids and/or immunosuppressant drugs. There is no indication for plasma exchanges, intravenous immunoglobulin or thymectomy (except in the presence of thymoma). This treatment could well decrease the risk of an evolution towards generalized myasthenia. The reasons underlying the vulnerability of ocular motor muscles in myasthenia are complex and several factors (linked to immunology, anatomy and function) may combine to bring about their specific involvement. In the future, randomized, controlled trials will be necessary, in order to determine a more rational approach of the treatment of ocular myasthenia, which currently lies mostly on retrospective data and the expertise of reference centers implicated in the management of the disease.

Abstract = {The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a rapid, easy-to-administer test for the assessment of cognition functions. It is widely used in clinical practice and in applied research. In this study, we aimed to establish a standard for the Mexican population similar to the ones produced for other relevant populations. We also analysed the effects of demographic variables which regularly induce bias in responses on performance tests, and then, on the basis of the results, implemented a series of corrections to the MMSE to compensate for the usual effects of age and years of formal education. We thus generated a newscale, the adjusted MMSE (AMMSE). We established the maximum sensitivity point to discriminate between the normal population and subjects diagnosed with dementia (vascular and Alzheimer’s). The study provides sensitivity and specificity estimates of this subject-standardized tool in order to reduce the probability of false positives and negatives in the Mexican population.

Abstract = {Objective: A study was undertaken to establish an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect JC virus (JCV)-specific antibodies in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and to evaluate its potential utility for identifying patients at higher or lower risk (ie, risk stratification) of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Methods: A 2-step assay for detecting and confirming the presence of anti-JCV antibodies in human serum and plasma was developed and demonstrated to be both sensitive and specific. ELISA cutpoints were statistically established using sera from >800 MS patients from natalizumab clinical studies. Subsequently, this assay was used to determine the presence of anti-JCV antibodies in natalizumab-treated PML patients where serum samples were collected 16-180 months prior to the diagnosis of PML. Results: In our evaluation of natalizumab-treated MS patients, 53.6% tested positive for anti-JCV antibodies, with a 95% confidence interval of 49.9 to 57.3%. The false-negative rate of the ELISA was calculated to be approximately 2.5%, with an upper 1-sided confidence limit of 4.4%. Notably, we observed anti-JCV antibodies in all 17 available pre-PML sera samples, which was significantly different from the 53.6% seropositivity observed in the overall MS study population (p < 0.0001). Interpretation: This 2-step assay provides a means to classify MS patients as having detectable or not detectable levels of anti-JCV antibodies. The finding that all 17 of the pre-PML samples that were available tested seropositive, and none tested seronegative, warrants further research on the clinical utility of the anti-JCV antibody assay as a potential tool for stratifying MS patients for higher or lower risk of developing PML.

Abstract = {Aim: We compared the clinical utility of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to catheter cerebral angiography (CA) in the investigation of children with suspected central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. METHOD Single-centre retrospective review of children with a suspected diagnosis of CNS vasculitis studied with both MRA and CA. MRA and CA-detected abnormalities (location, multiplicity, and morphology) were compared; sensitivity and specificity were calculated on a per lesion and per patient basis for MRA, with CA as the reference standard. Results: Findings in fourteen patients (median age at presentation of 5y 10mo [range 1y 5mo-14y 5mo]; eight males, six females) relating to sixteen paired studies of MRA and CA were reviewed. CA-detected lesions were commonly bilateral (13/16 studies, p < 0.05), and likely to be proximally distributed (15/16 studies, p < 0.05).The sensitivity and specificity of MRA for CA lesion detection was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48-78) and 89% (95% CI 81-93), respectively with moderate agreement between the two modalities (κ = 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-O.66). The majority of the false negative observations involved the posterior circulation (9/14). The overall sensitivity for MRA diagnosis of vasculitis per patient was 94% (95% CI 67-99). Interpretation: MRA failed to identify all lesions detected on CA, particularly those in the posterior circulation. MRA is a reasonable initial modality in the investigation of suspected CNS vasculitis but in cases of abnormal parenchymal MRI and normal MRA, CA should be considered.

Abstract = {Introduction: Researchers have used breath carbon monoxide (CO) cutoff values ranging from 4 to 10 ppm to define abstinence in cigarette-smoking cessation research and reductions in CO as a measure of acute abstinence in laboratory research. The current study used a reversal design to investigate effects of exhalation speed on CO output in four groups (non-, light, moderate, and heavy smokers; n = 20 per group). Methods: In one condition, participants were instructed to empty their lungs as quickly as possible (fast), whereas in a different condition, participants were instructed to empty their lungs at a slow pace (slow). Conditions were counterbalanced and repeated twice for each participant. Results: For all groups, speed of exhalation was significantly lower during the slow condition than during the fast condition, and CO output was significantly higher during the slow condition than during the fast condition. Sensitivity and specificity analyses revealed that the optimal CO cutoff for smoking abstinence was 3 ppm during the fast condition versus 4 ppm during the slow condition. Additionally, when heavy smokers switched from exhaling slow to exhaling fast, they showed an approximately 30% reduction in CO. Discussion: The results suggest that exhalation speed should be monitored when CO is used as a measure of smoking status for laboratory and smoking cessation research. If exhalation speed is not monitored when using CO to verify smoking cessation, then more conservative CO cutoff values should be used to avoid false negative CO readings.

Abstract = {Background: Criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) predict dementia risk in the clinic. Dementia risk in the population is different and whether there is an optimal MCI-derived threshold for discriminating at-risk from not-at-risk cases in the general older population is not known. Methods: Data were from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Two risk thresholds were derived from each of seven different concepts of MCI including: Mayo Clinic-defined amnestic, nonamnestic, multiple, and revised MCI, MCI based on Mini-Mental State Examination derived categories, and the definitions of Cognitive Impairment No Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Decline (ARCD). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare the predictive validity of 2-year incident dementia for each risk threshold across the different MCI definitions. Findings: MCI-derived risk thresholds varied in their ability to predict dementia. MCI thresholds were accurate in identifying individuals not at-risk of dementia progression (false-negative range: 0%–3.4%). No MCI-derived threshold accurately identified an at-risk group with a 2-year progression rate greater than 20%. Criteria for ARCD defined the threshold with the highest sensitivity and specificity for dementia conversion. Interpretation: MCI-derived thresholds do not reliably identify individuals at-risk of incident dementia at 2 years when applied in the general population. A large subpopulation of individuals not at-risk was more reliably identified. What is considered a sufficient level of accuracy for identification of individuals at increased risk of dementia depends on the motivation for screening and on the safety and efficacy of available interventions.

Abstract = {Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants for the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) but data on their efficacy are controversial. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and acceptability of SSRIs in the treatment of depression in PD. Results: Ten studies were included. In the comparison between SSRIs and Placebo (n = 6 studies), the combined risk ratio (random effects) was 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 0.77 - 1.55, p = 0.67). In the comparison between SSRIs and Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) (n = 3 studies) the combined risk ratio was 0.75 (0.39 - 1.42, p = 0.37). An acceptability analysis showed that SSRIs were generally well tolerated. Conclusions: These results suggest that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no differences in efficacy between SSRIs and placebo in the treatment of depression in PD. Due to the limited number of studies and the small sample sizes a type II error (false negative) cannot be excluded. The comparison between SSRIs and TCAs is based on only three studies and further trials with more pragmatic design are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction: Widespread tobacco use and high interest in quitting make prisons an ideal environment for smoking cessation interventions; however, little has been done to assist prisoners in their efforts to quit. Valid measurement of tobacco use is a prerequisite to evaluation of cessation programs, yet there has been only one published examination of tobacco use measures among prisoners. Methods: Tobacco use interviews were conducted with 200 male prisoners. Three measures of tobacco use, exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO), salivary cotinine measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and salivary cotinine measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), were evaluated using self-reported tobacco use as the reference. Optimum cutpoints were identified by maximization of the Youden index. Results: Carbon monoxide breath testing, though the poorest performing of the three measures examined, still had excellent discrimination (cutpoint ≥ 4 ppm, sensitivity = 88.3%, specificity = 94.9%). Cotinine EIA performed better than eCO (cutpoint ≥ 10 ng/ml, sensitivity = 92.2%, specificity = 94.3%) but poorer than cotinine LC/MS/MS (cutpoint ≥ 9 ng/ml, sensitivity = 98.6%, specificity = 97.8%). Discussion: eCO had the poorest performance as a standalone test, though validity of the test may be improved with increased frequency of testing. False-negative results using cotinine EIA limit its utility as a standalone test, however, as part of a two-stage screening process it may reduce the cost of testing. Cotinine LC/MS/MS, while most expensive, was the most accurate standalone measure of prisoners’ tobacco use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

A reason to suspect differences is that as a group twins are more likely than singletons to experience adverse prenatal and perinatal events that may affect brain development. We sought to assess whether this increased risk leads to differences in child or adolescent brain anatomy in twins who do not experience behavioral or neurological sequelae during the perinatal period. Brain MRI scans of 185 healthy pediatric twins (mean age = 11.0, SD = 3.6) were compared to scans of 167 age- and sex-matched unrelated singletons on brain structures measured, which included gray and white matter lobar volumes, ventricular volume, and area of the corpus callosum. There were no significant differences between groups for any structure, despite sufficient power for low type II (i.e. false negative) error. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) within this age range and for these measures, it is appropriate to include healthy twins in studies of typical brain development, and (2) findings regarding heritability of brain structures obtained from twin studies can be generalized to non-twin populations.

Abstract = {Hippocampal volume is reduced in Alzheimer Disease (AD) and has been proposed as a possible surrogate biomarker to aid early diagnosis. Whilst automated methods to segment the hippocampus from magnetic resonance images are available, manual segmentation, in spite of being time-consuming and unsuitable for large samples, is still the standard. In order to study the validity of FreeSurfer's automated method, we compared hippocampal automated measures with manual tracing in a sample composed of healthy elderly (N = 41), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (N = 23), and AD (N = 25) subjects. Percent volume overlap, percent volume difference, correlations, and Bland–Altman plots were studied. Automated measures were slightly larger than hand tracing ones (mean difference 10%). Percent volume overlap showed good results, but was far from perfect (78%). Manual and automated volume correlations were approximately 0.84 and the Bland–Altman analysis showed acceptable interchangeability of methods. Within-group analysis demonstrated that patient samples obtained smaller values in validity indexes than controls. Globally, FreeSurfer's automated hippocampal volumetry showed adequate validity when compared to manual tracing, with a tendency to overestimation. Nevertheless, the greater difference between automated and manual segmentation in atrophic brains suggests that studies in AD based on this software could be more likely to produce false negatives.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by C. F. Ryschkewitsch et al. (see record [rid]2010-19761-018[/rid]). In their article, the authors describe the detection of anti-John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibodies in multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) patients. The Ryschkewitsch et al. results were interpreted in an accompanying editorial as demonstrating a 12% false-negative rate for PML patients, implying that anti-JCV antibody serology may not be an adequately sensitive method for detecting JCV presence or for PML risk stratification. However, it is essential to note that all 3 of these post-PML samples that tested negative or borderline positive in the Ryschkewitsch assay were collected during plasma exchange, which is used to remove natalizumab from the circulation. In this comment, the authors discuss the ways in which assay design and sample collection can affect virus antibody detection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In the past two decades, the incidence and severity of medical disputes have greatly increased in China. We believe that the following could help end violence against Chinese doctors. First, investment in health resources should be increased. According to the Ministry of Public Health, China, with 20% of the world's population, has a health expenditure that accounts for only 3% of the world's total. Second, the health literacy of Chinese adults should be improved. Third, the professional ethics of doctors should be strengthened. Finally, the professional morality of media workers should be addressed. To increase audience ratings, some Chinese media workers write negative or even false reports of medical disputes. We hope that the government, patients, doctors, and media workers reflect on their individual responsibilities to reduce the violence against Chinese doctors.

Self–other distinction, as documented by mirror self-recognition (MSR), allows for empathy which offers a motivational base for helping a person in need. Kärtner and Keller propose a different, culture-related, possibility of helping based on shared intentional relations and emotional contagion which could explain helping behavior in Indian children not yet capable of MSR. Due to the experimental setting, however, other releasers of children’s sadness and helping behavior have to be considered. An alternative setting is proposed. With respect to MSR, the question of false negatives is discussed. The issues mentioned by Klann-Delius address fundamental theoretical questions that cannot be answered briefly.

Abstract = {Background: Prospective testing of denitrogenation protocols to reduce the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) in astronauts requires pre-defined accept and reject criteria. We assume that the end-point of a test, the presence or absence of signs and symptoms attributable to DCS, is unequivocal. However, diagnosis of DCS is not perfect, nor is there is a gold standard to assess diagnosis error rates. These error rates could cause consistent bias in the decision to accept or reject proposed protocols. We used a Latent Class Model (LCM) incorporating inter-rater agreement to estimate false-positive and negative rates of DCS diagnosis for each of six symptomatic (covariate) strata. Methods: Case descriptions from 135 reports collected since 1982 were available with 103 diagnosed as DCS (73.1%). There were 3 subsets of 45 descriptions that were randomly selected, information about the original diagnosis omitted, and were sent to 15 physicians (raters), all experts in altitude DCS. Subsets were diagnosed for DCS by either four, five, or six raters. We then used a LCM to estimate false-positive and false-negative error rates for the original NASA test diagnosis, even though a gold standard was not available. Results: Estimates of false-positive rates in the NASA diagnoses ranged from 13% to 83% and from 1% to 32% for false-negative rates over the six strata of symptomatic response variables. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of current DCS diagnostic outcomes as if they were error free would likely produce an inflated rejection rate of acceptable protocols in future testing if adjustments are not made.

Abstract = {Data from 64 adolescent inpatients admitted for serious suicidal ideation, 50 adolescent inpatients admitted following a suicide attempt, and 56 randomly selected high school control participants were used to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale—2nd Edition (RADS-2). The purpose of the study was to provide information necessary for selecting assessment tools to use in large-scale screenings of high school students for suicide risk. The hypothesis that a combination of mean scores on the two measures and critical item scores would provide the best clinical utility was partially supported. The SIQ was found to be very useful in discriminating between the study groups, whereas the RADS-2 did not perform as expected. The fewest false negatives would result from relying on RADS-2 scale scores ≥63 and SIQ scale scores ≥14. However, the parsimonious and hence most cost-effective approach would be to rely on SIQ scale scores ≥14 in combination with SIQ critical Items 2, 3, and 4 for screening purposes.

Abstract = {Introduction--The application of de Seze et al. criteria (2007) to patients presenting a first severe acute demyelinating event helps to distinguish acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) from other CNS inflammatory diseases, with 83% sensitivity and 95% specificity. We applied these criteria to 14 patients who presented a first severe acute demyelinating event and whose later clinical course enabled clear identification of the neurological diagnosis. Method/Patients--This study concerned 14 patients who presented a first acute demyelinating event. Initially, there were 16 patients but two were excluded because their initial clinical condition (isolated acute retrobulbar optic neuritis in one and acute cervical myelitis in the other) would have excluded them in the princeps article. We identified 11 women (78.6%) and three men (21.4%) with a mean age of 33.7 ± 12.5 years. Follow-up ranged from three months to 11.5 years after the initial episode (average four years). At last follow-up, the diagnosis was ADEM in seven patients (50%) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in seven (50%). Five of seven patients in the MS group had a tumor-like presentation (71.4%), this parameter partly explaining the initial discrepancy in diagnosis. When applied to our series, de Seze criteria for ADEM exhibited 85.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Conclusion--Applying the new criteria, we did not find the same sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values as in the original article. The lack of specificity arose from the misclassification of MS patients with a tumor-like presentation (two out of five false negatives). One of the explanations is that the clinical criteria used can be part of atypical forms of MS, in particular in its tumor-like presentation. De Seze et al. criteria can be an invaluable help for the clinician in the diagnosis of a first severe demyelinating event. Considering our results, these criteria should not be applied for patients with a tumor-like form of MS. A prospective study in a larger cohort is needed to confirm or invalidate these preliminary results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The MMSE is the most widely used cognitive test but its accuracy and clinical utility in diagnosing cognitive disorders is not fully known. A meta-analysis of 34 dementia studies and five mild cognitive impairment (MCI) studies was conducted, separated into high and low prevalence settings. In memory clinic settings the MMSE had a pooled sensitivity (Se) of 79.8%, a specificity (Sp) of 81.3%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 86.3% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 73.0%. In mixed specialist hospital settings the Se, Sp, PPV and NPV were 71.1%, 95.6%, 94.2% and 76.4%, respectively. In non-clinical community settings the MMSE had a pooled Se of 85.1%, a Sp of 85.5%, a PPV of 34.5% and an NPV of 98.5%. In those studies conducted purely in primary care the Se, Sp, PPV and NPV were 78.4%, 87.8%. 53.6% and 95.7%, respectively. Thus the case-finding ability of the MMSE was best when confirming a suspected diagnosis in specialist settings with correct identification made in 27/30 positive results. It was modestly effective at ruling-out dementia in specialist settings. Conversely, in non-specialist settings, the MMSE was best at ruling out dementia, achieving about 29/30 correct reassurances with less than three false negatives out of every 100 screens. Regarding use of the MMSE in identifying MCI, limited evidence was found with only five robust studies comparing MCI with healthy subjects and three comparing Alzheimer’s disease with MCI. Provisionally, the MMSE had very limited value in making a diagnosis of MCI against healthy controls and modest rule-out accuracy. It had similarly limited ability to help identify cases of Alzheimer’s disease against MCI. In conclusion the MMSE offers modest accuracy with best value for ruling-out a diagnosis of dementia in community and primary care. For all other used it should be combined with or replaced by other methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Sequential testing is applied to reduce costs in SP-based tests (OSCEs), Initially, all candidates take a screening test consisting of a part of the OSCE. Candidates who fail the screen sit the complete test, whereas those who pass the screen are qualified as a pass of the complete test. The procedure may result in a reduction of testing resources, but at the cost of false positives (candidates who pass the screen but would fail the complete test). In a diagnostic test an optimum cutpoint is obtained by minimizing the weighted sum of false negatives and false positives using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. However, in the sequential procedure there are no false negatives, because the result of the complete test is considered the final outcome. Several authors ignored this difference and applied classic ROC analysis to a sequential test. Earlier, we doubted the validity of the procedure and proposed to set the cutpoint by minimizing the loss, defined as the weighted sum of the screen negatives and the false positives. Recently, Regehr and Colliver (2003) argued that under certain theoretically derived conditions the use of the loss formula in sequential testing is functionally identical to using classic ROC analysis. The current study shows (a) the conclusion of Regehr and Colliver is based on assumptions that can be challenged, and (b) ROC analysis indeed can be used in sequential testing, but only if the procedure is modified according to the results of a corresponding loss function analysis.

Abstract = {Objective: To study the problem of false negatives in the screening for eating disorders. Subjects and Methods: We administered the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT40) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) to 186 Italian female students (age 17.68 ± 0.9; BMI 20.84 ± 2.69). Then we submitted not only high-scorers but also all the subjects to a semi-structured diagnostic interview (Eating Disorder Examination - EDE 12.0D). The diagnosis of eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) was applied to cases which met all the DSM-IV criteria for AN and/or BN with one exception. Results: 17 girls (9.1%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for eating disorders: 1 bulimia nervosa full-syndrome and 16 EDNOS. Of the 17 girls 11 were EAT low-scorers (< 30) and 8 were EDI low-scorers (< 50); 5 subjects scored below the cutoff on both instruments. We calculated sensitivity (35.3%), specificity (88.8%), positive predictive value (PPV, 24.0%) and negative predictive value (NPV, 93.2%) of the EAT40; the respective values for the EDI were 52.9% (sensitivity), 85.2% (specificity), 26.4% (PPV) and 94.7% (NPV). Discussion and conclusion: Our data show that the introduction of the EDNOS diagnoses increases the PPV of the two questionnaires but lowers their sensitivity. We conclude that using a two stage screening approach leads to a very high rate of false negatives with a significant underestimation of the prevalence of eating disorders, particularly of EDNOS.

Abstract = {Purpose: Previous research has documented that diabetes distress, defined as patient concerns about disease management, support, emotional burden, and access to care, is an important condition distinct from depression. We wanted to develop a brief diabetes distress screen instrument for use in clinical settings. Methods: We assessed 496 community-based patients with type 2 diabetes on the previously validated, 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS17) and 6 biobehavioral measures: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); non-high-density-lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol; kilocalories, percentage of calories from fat, and number of fruit and vegetable servings consumed per day; and physical activity as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: An average item score of ≥3 (moderate distress) discriminated high from low-distressed subgroups. The 4 DDS17 items with the highest correlations with the DDS17 total (r = .56-.61) were selected. Composites, comprised of 2, 3, and 4 of these items (DDS2, DDS3, DDS4), yielded higher correlations (r = .69-.71). The sensitivity and specificity of the composites were .95 and .85, .93 and .87, and .97 and .86, respectively. The DDS3 had a lower sensitivity and higher percentages of false-negative and false-positive results. All 3 composites significantly discriminated subgroups on HbA1c, non-HDL cholesterol, and kilocalories consumed per day; none discriminated subgroups on fruit and vegetable servings consumed per day; and only the DDS3 yielded significant results on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Because of its psychometric properties and brevity, the DDS2 was selected as a screening instrument. Conclusions: The DDS2 is a 2-item diabetes distress screening instrument asking respondents to rate on a 6-point scale the degree to which the following items caused distress: (1) feeling overwhelmed by the demands of living with diabetes, and (2) feeling that I am often failing with my diabetes regimen. The DDS17 can be administered to those who have positive findings on the DDS2 to define the content of distress and to direct intervention.

Abstract = {Linkage of household survey responses with administrative data is increasingly on the agenda. Unique individual identifiers have clear benefits for making linkages but are also subject to problems of survey item non-response and measurement error. Our experimental study that linked survey responses to UK government agency records on benefits and tax credits elucidates this trade-off. We compare five linkage criteria: one based on a respondent-supplied National Insurance Number (NINO) and the other four using different combinations of sex, name, address and date of birth. As many linkages were made using non-NINO-based matches as were made using matches on NINO and the former were also relatively accurate when assessed in terms of false-positive and false-negative linkage rates. The potential returns from hierarchical and pooled matching are also examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The process of setting a standard when pass/fail decisions have to be made inevitably involves judgment about the point on the test score scale where performance is deemed to be adequate for the purpose for which the examination is set. As with any process which involves human judgment, setting this standard is likely to include a certain degree of error, which may result in some false positive and false negative decisions. The customary practice of maintaining a constant point on the test score scale at which pass/fail separations are made cannot be justified, as examinations vary in difficulty. The aim of standard setting procedures is to minimize such errors while accounting for the varying difficulty of examinations. A standard may be norm-referenced, where it is dependent on the performance of the particular group of examinees, or criterion-referenced, where it is based on predetermined criteria, irrespective of examinee performance. Where certification of competence is the primary purpose of an examination, the latter is preferred as the decision to be made is whether an individual is competent to practise rather than competent compared to peers. Several methods of standard setting have been used, some of which are based solely on predetermined criteria, while others compromise between norm- and criterion-referenced standards. This guide examines the more commonly used methods of standard setting, illustrates the procedure used in each with the help of an example, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of each. The common errors made by judges in the standard setting process are pointed out and the manner in which judges should be selected, trained and instructed emphasized. A method used for equating similar tests set at different times with the intention of maintaining standards from one examination to the next is illustrated with an example. Finally, the guide proposes a practical method for arriving at a predetermined standard by the proportionate selection of test-items of known relative difficulties in relation to minimally competent examinees.

Abstract = {Qualitative and quantitative changes in dogs’ information-seeking behaviours during the subsequent phases of operant conditioning training using a scent lineup, were investigated. Particular interest was paid to behaviours which may have an impact on errors committed by dogs at work in a scent lineup and thus on the reliability of the canine identification of humans on the base of scent. Significant individual differences were found in dogs’ performance in operant conditioning during match-to-sample trials. The style and time of sniffing the pattern scent sample as well as the searching time and number of stations sniffed in the lineup were found to influence the percentage of errors (false positive and false negative indications) made by dogs. The effects of the dogs’ routine e.g. omitting stations, using other cues than olfactory ones (visual) and effects of the non-verbal communications between handler and dog have been discussed.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to question emotional consequences of referee mistakes, by the mean of interviews of soccer players. One hundred and three soccer players have taken part in the study. Participants were 15 to 56 years old. They have fulfilled the French version of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and taken part to a twenty to thirty minutes semi-directing-interview. The interview was structured around six situations that reflected the crossing of two variables: the kind of referee's decisions (x3) and the repetition of the situation (x2). It was asked to participants what they felt in each of these situations. The main results showed that the referee's mistakes generated feelings of irritation, anger and the perception of injustice. These feelings occurred all the more as referee's mistakes were repetitive. However, false positive mistakes and false negative mistakes were different in their consequences both on feelings and on behaviors. These differences were questioned as regard to the differences in coercion relations between theses actors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We have developed a method for extracting the number of trial participants from abstracts describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs); the number of trial participants may be an indication of the reliability of the trial. The method depends on statistical natural language processing. The number of interest was determined by a binary supervised classification based on a support vector machine algorithm. The method was trialled on 223 abstracts in which the number of trial participants was identified manually to act as a gold standard. Automatic extraction resulted in 2 false-positive and 19 false-negative classifications. The algorithm was capable of extracting the number of trial participants with an accuracy of 97% and an F-measure of 0.84. The algorithm may improve the selection of relevant articles in regard to question-answering, and hence may assist in decision-making. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine (1) the stability of latent classes associated with reading disability (RD) and typical development (TD) across time, (2) the importance of speeded word recognition as a latent class indicator of RD and TD, and (3) possible early indicators of students with late-emerging RD. Analyses were based on a longitudinal sample of 177 students, some of whom had been assigned randomly to small-group tutoring in either fall or spring of 1st grade. At the end of 1st, 2nd, and 4th grades, students were assessed on word identification, sight word efficiency (SWE), and passage comprehension. Latent transition analysis models were developed to examine classification transitions from 1st to 4th grade and 2nd to 4th grade. Results indicated that RD/TD classification was relatively stable across time, however 5 students were consistently identified as having late-emerging RD. Findings indicated that SWE measured in 2nd grade reduced the number of false negatives for RD and was therefore important for the classification of RD. Finally, although students with late-emerging RD had poorer listening comprehension skill at the start of 1st grade and smaller word reading fluency slopes during 1st grade compared to TD children, these indicators did not reliably distinguish students with late-emerging RD from TD due to high rates of false positives.

Abstract = {Public officials with the authority to order hurricane evacuations face a difficult trade-off between risks to life and costly false alarms. Evacuation decisions must be made on the basis of imperfect information, in the form of forecasts. The quality of these decisions can be improved if they are also informed by measures of uncertainty about the forecast, including estimates of the value of waiting for updated, more accurate, forecasts. Using a stochastic model of storm motion derived from historic tracks, this paper explores the relationship between lead time and track uncertainty for Atlantic hurricanes and the implications of this relationship for evacuation decisions. Typical evacuation clearance times and track uncertainty imply that public officials who require no more than a 10% probability of failing to evacuate before a striking hurricane (a false negative) must accept that at least 76%—and for some locations over 90%—of evacuations will be false alarms. Reducing decision lead times from 72 to 48 hours for major population centers could save an average of hundreds of millions of dollars in evacuation costs annually, with substantial geographic variation in savings.

Abstract = {There is now consistent evidence emphasising the benefits of, and minimal risk from, newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF NBS). Parents unanimously support screening, and very few decline it. Although early psychosocial concerns have proved unfounded, such issues remain problematic within the context of contemporary protocols, prognosis and treatment. In this article we consider the psychosocial evidence regarding prescreening information; waiting for diagnosis; the effects of false-negative, false-positive, and true-positive results; identifying infants with carrier status; and parents' future reproductive decision-making. We discuss the continuing influence these issues bear on protocol design and reflect on clinical implications and future directions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {ADHD is a heritable condition of childhood for which several risk alleles have been identified. However, observed effect sizes have been small and few replicated polymorphisms have been identified. There are many reasons for the lack of one-to-one correspondence between genotype and phenotype in ADHD. Endophenotypes are non-clinical markers of genetic risk which may facilitate gene discovery in complex disorders like ADHD. The most common endophenotypes under consideration in ADHD are neuropsychological measures of executive function, although a range of psychological, physiological and neuroanatomical endophenotypes have been proposed. If carefully chosen, endophenotypes have the potential to increase the power of genetic research to identify susceptibility genes. If not carefully selected, endophenotypes may generate false negative and false positive results. This paper reviews the theoretical rationale for endophenotypes and proposes a priori criteria by which ADHD endophenotypes should be selected and validated. The literature on motor response inhibition is reviewed to illustrate the validation process which is recommended in the selection of other candidate endophenotypes.

Abstract = {Comments on an article, "Predicting the development of schizophrenia in high-risk populations: systematic review of the predictive validity of prodromal criteria" by J. Chuma & P. Mahadun (2011). The aim of Chuna & Mahadun’s study is compelling and of great clinical interest for preventive interventions in psychosis. Unluckily, the results presented by the authors are not reliable as they are undermined by severe methodological caveats. First, the systematic research of the literature failed to uncover the majority of studies reporting follow-up transition rates in a sample of individuals at high risk (HR) for psychosis. The authors included only 12 studies but many more were available in the electronic databases (references supplied). Second, the authors did not check for potential overlapping between samples including studies enrolling the same individuals. Third, the authors stated in the inclusion criteria that the included studies 'had a clearly specified population, from which a prodromal criterion was administered to identify clearly those with prodromal symptoms [HR +] from those without [HR7]'. This is really surprising as the vast majority of the longitudinal studies did not follow-up the help-seeking individuals who underwent the clinical assessment at the prodromal services but were not considered at risk for psychosis (HR–). Consequently, it is completely obscure how the authors may have estimated the correct prevalence of false negatives in their analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {One of the main problems to be solved while assisting inter-human conflict resolution is how to reuse the previous experience with similar agents. A machine learning technique for handling scenarios of interaction between conflicting human agents is proposed. Scenarios are represented by directed graphs with labelled vertices (for communicative actions) and arcs (for temporal and causal relationships between these actions and their parameters). For illustrative purposes, classification of a scenario is computed by comparing partial matching of its graph with graphs of positive and negative examples. Nearest Neighbour learning is followed by the JSM-based learning which minimised the number of false negatives and takes advantage of a more accurate way of matching sequences of communicative actions. Developed scenario representation and comparative analysis techniques are applied to the classification of textual customer complaints. It is shown that analysing the structure of communicative actions without context information is frequently sufficient to estimate complaint validity. Therefore, being domain-independent, proposed machine learning technique is a good compliment to a wide range of customer relation management applications where formal treatment of inter-human interactions is required in a decision-support mode.

Abstract = {Purpose: A risk prediction index, similar to those used for other disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, would facilitate depression prevention by identifying those who would benefit most from preventative measures in primary care settings. Methods: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health enrolled a representative sample of US adolescents and included a baseline survey in 1995 and a 1-year follow-up survey in 1996 (n = 4,791). We used baseline risk factors (social and cognitive vulnerability and mood) to predict onset of a depressive episode at 1-year follow-up (eg, future risk of episode) and used boosted classification and regression trees to develop a prediction index, The Chicago Adolescent Depression Risk Assessment, suitable for a personal computer or hand-held device. True and false positives and negatives were determined based on concordance and discordance, respectively, between the prediction-category-based index and actual classification-category-based 1-year follow-up outcome. We evaluated the performance of the index for the entire sample and with several depressive episode outcomes using the standard Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale cutoffs. Results: The optimal prediction model (including depressed mood and social vulnerability) was a 20-item model with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80 (95% Cl, 0.714-0.870), a sensitivity of 75%, and a specificity of 76.5%. For depressive episode, the positive predictive values in the highest risk group (level 4) was from 13.75% for a depressive episode to 63.57% for CES-D score of greater than 16 (mild to moderate depressed mood or above) at follow-up. Conversely, the negative predictive value of being in the lowest 2 levels (0 or 1) was 99.38% for a depressive episode and 89.19% for a CES-D score of greater than 16. Conclusions: Our model predicts a depressive episode and other depressive outcomes at 1-year follow-up. Positive and negative predictive values could enable primary care physicians and families to intervene on adolescents at highest risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In this study, we sought to determine the accuracy of a computer algorithm that automatically assesses head computed tomography (CT) studies in patients with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) for features of intracranial hemorrhage and mass effect, employing a neuroradiologist’s interpretation as the gold standard. To this end, we designed a suite of computer algorithms that evaluates in a fully automated fashion the presence of intracranial blood and/or mass effect based on the following CT findings: (1) presence or absence of a subdural or epidural hematoma, (2) presence or absence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, (3) presence or absence of an intraparenchymal hematoma, (4) presence or absence of clinically significant midline shift (≥5 mm), and (5) normal, partly effaced, or completely effaced basal cisterns. The algorithm displays abnormal findings as color overlays on the original head CT images, and calculates the volume of each type of blood collection, the midline shift, and the volume of the basal cisterns, based on the above-described features. Thresholds and parameters yielding optimal accuracy of the computer algorithm were determined using a development sample of 33 selected, nonconsecutive patients. The software was then applied to a validation sample of 250 consecutive patients evaluated for suspicion of acute TBI at our institution in 2006–2007. Software detection of the presence of at least one noncontrast CT (NCT) feature of acute TBI demonstrated high sensitivity of 98% and high negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. There was actually only one false negative case, where a very subtle subdural hematoma, extending exclusively along the falx, was diagnosed by the neuroradiologist , while the case was considered as normal by the computer algorithm. The software was excellent at detecting the presence of mass effect and intracranial hemorrhage, but showed some disagreements with the neuroradiologist in quantifying the degree of mass effect and characterizing the type of intracranial hemorrhage. In summary, we have developed a fully automated computer algorithm that demonstrated excellent sensitivity for acute intracranial hemorrhage and clinically significant midline shift, while maintaining intermediate specificity. Further studies are required to evaluate the potential favorable impact of this software on facilitating workflow and improving diagnostic accuracy when used as a screening aid by physicians with different levels of experience.

Abstract = {Objective: Many studies of the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have used percent reduction cutoffs on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) to classify patients as treatment responders. However, reduction criteria have varied from 20% to 50%, with studies of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) using a more stringent criterion than studies of pharmacotherapy. The aim of this retrospective investigation was to determine optimal YBOCS reduction criteria for classifying patients as responders. Method: Data from 87 adult clinic and research outpatients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD according to structured interview were examined, comparing the percent YBOCS reduction from pretreatment to posttreatment with 2 "gold standard" criteria from the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale: much or very much improved and mild illness or better. Signal detection analyses were used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive test, predictive value of a negative test, and efficiency of various YBOCS reduction cutoffs. Results: A YBOCS reduction cutoff of 30% was optimal for predicting improvement on the CGI. The 20% cutoff used by many pharmacologic studies resulted in a high number of false positives, whereas the 50% cutoff used by most CBT studies resulted in a high number of false negatives. For predicting mild illness or better at posttreatment. a YBOCS reduction cutoff of 40% to 50% was optimal. Conclusions: A YBOCS reduction criterion of 30% appears to be optimal for determining clinical improvement, whereas a 40% to 50% reduction criterion is appropriate for predicting mild illness at posttreatment. Future studies should employ a standard definition of treatment response in order to facilitate cross-study comparisons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Over the last few years in Australia, the issue of asylum seekers has been a significant feature of the media, and a topic that many people feel very strongly about. However, there is little empirical research regarding attitudes toward asylum seekers. The purpose of the present study was to examine such attitudes in the Perth community, and what predicts them. In Study 1, an Attitudes Toward Asylum Seekers (ATAS) scale was constructed. In Study 2, self-esteem, national identity, false beliefs, and sociodemographics were used in an attempt to predict ATAS in a random survey of the Perth metropolitan area. Results indicated a weak correlation between high self-esteem and negative attitudes, and a strong correlation between a high level of false beliefs and negative attitudes. As a result of this latter relationship, two hierarchical regression equations were constructed: one predicting negative attitudes, the other predicting false beliefs. Regarding the ATAS scale, being male, higher levels of education, right-wing political position, and high levels of national identity had significant predictive value. Regarding the false beliefs scale, higher levels of education, right-wing political position, high levels of national identity, and increased age had significant predictive value. Given the large number of participants who scored above the midpoint of the ATAS scale, coupled with the high level of false beliefs reported, we suggest that a great deal of education about asylum seekers is called for.

Abstract = {There are many issues in regards to whether or not the composite of Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests used to determine the working memory index of the Taiwan WAIS-III is compatible with that of the English WAIS-III, and whether the individual Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests, and the span scores of the Digit Span subtest are adequate for measuring working memory. This study was thus to make an attempt to examine these issues. In this retrospective study, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were employed, using brain imaging data of 179 patients with various CNS diseases as the gold standard, to identify the working-memory-related scores in the Taiwan WAIS-III. The results, as estimated by a composite of the Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests, revealed all the specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the Taiwan WAIS-III working memory index were each at or above 94%, yet the sensitivity was only 63%. The sensitivities of the Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests were even poorer, measuring only 50%. However, the positive predictive value of the Digit Span subtest was 86% while the Arithmetic subtest was 67%. In addition, the forward and backward span scores of the Digit Span subtest had good negative predictive value (all of them were above 92%), but poor sensitivity (all of them were below 58%). Based on the present findings, it appears that all the Taiwan WAIS-III working memory index, the single Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests, and the span scores of the Digit Span subtest could adequately discriminate individuals without working memory impairment, but had poor sensitivity on detecting the patients who evidenced working memory impairment. Accordingly, it is suggested that clinicians should gauge the working memory index by a composite of the Arithmetic, the Digit Span, and the Letter-Number Sequencing subtests if possible. Otherwise, a caveat should be taken with care to interpret the working memory index, as estimated by a composite of the Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests, because the chance of the increasing false negative rate becomes ineludible. Respecting the limitations of retrospective study, however, it is necessary to make a prospective study to re-approach this issue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {We report on a 47-year-old woman with autopsy proven Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), who had a positive initial 14-3-3 test but a subsequent negative test under pharmacologic suppression of the periodic epileptiform discharges on EEG. Multiple factors associated with a subsequent 14-3-3 test becoming negative are known. However, none of these circumstances were applicable to our patient. This case history suggests sedative therapy in CJD may induce false negative 14-3-3 testing. This appears to be a relevant finding, since the differential diagnosis between non-convulsive status epilepticus and CJD is not always evident in the initial stage of the disease and some patients with CJD present with seizures.

Abstract = {Objective: The gradual development of cutaneous allodynia during the course of a migraine attack is commonly detected by quantitative sensory testing (QST) in migraineurs seeking secondary and tertiary medical help. In this study, the authors developed a questionnaire that tested the recollection of the patients on their skin sensitivity during past migraine attacks. Methods: The authors devised a series of questions regarding skin sensitivity during migraine and posed them to 89 migraineurs when they were free of migraine (Visit 1). To validate their recollections, the authors determined the patients' pain thresholds to mechanical and thermal skin stimuli in the absence of migraine (Visit 1) and during an attack (Visit 2), using QST. Results: Whereas 75.3% of the patients testified to at least one type of skin hypersensitivity during migraine, 24.7% were unaware of any abnormal skin sensitivity. The questionnaire correctly identified 84.8% of the 66 patients classified as allodynic by QST and mislabeled the remaining 15.2% as nonallodynic (false negatives). Among the 23 patients classified as nonallodynic by QST, 47.8% were mislabeled as allodynic using the questionnaire (false positives). Among the total number of 89 patients studied, the questionnaire produced 62.9% true positives and 13.5% true negatives (= 76.4% correct labeling) vs 12.4% false positives and 11.2% false negatives (= 23.6% mislabeling). Conclusion: The reliability of the questionnaire as a diagnostic tool of allodynia varies with the proportion of allodynic patients in a given clinic. The major source of variability is the misconception of nonallodynic patients that their skin is hypersensitive during migraine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Regulatory focus theory distinguishes between two motivational systems--a promotion system concerned with nurturance and advancement and a prevention system concerned with security and safety [Higgins, E. T. (1997). Beyond pleasure and pain. American Psychologist, 52, 1280-1300]. In signal detection terms, a preference for eager strategies within the promotion system has been equated with a "risky" bias, whereas a preference for vigilant strategies within the prevention system has been equated with a "conservative" bias. However, we propose that when prevention-focused individuals face negative input, they should be willing to incur false alarms to ensure that negative stimuli are correctly identified. Across six studies, we found for negative stimuli a reversal of the traditional finding that prevention participants show a conservative bias in information processing. In these studies, prevention participants consistently exhibited a risky bias when the input was negative. We suggest that this new tactic--a risky bias in response to negativity--best serves the prevention strategy of vigilance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Two experiments examined the link between interpretation and memory in individuals diagnosed with Generalized Social Phobia (GSP). In Experiment 1, GSP and control participants generated continuations for nonsocial and ambiguous social scenarios. GSP participants produced more socially anxious and negative continuations for the social scenarios than did the controls. On the subsequent test of recalling the social scenarios, intrusion errors that shared meaning with the original continuations were made more frequently by the GSP group, producing false recall with emotionally negative features. To examine whether nonanxious individuals would also produce such errors if given emotional interpretations, in Experiment 2 the authors asked university students to read the scenarios plus endings produced by GSP participants in Experiment 1. The students either constructed vivid mental images of themselves as the main characters or thought about whether the endings provided closure. Low-anxious students in the closure condition produced fewer ending-based intrusions in recalling the social scenarios than did students in the other 3 conditions. Results illustrate the importance of examining the nature of source-monitoring errors in investigations of memory biases in social anxiety.

Abstract = {The United States Court Interpreters Act (US Congress, 1978) requires that interpreters in US federal courts be certified through a criterion-referenced performance test. The Federal Court Interpreter Certification Examination (FCICE) is a two-phase certification battery for federal court interpreters. Phase I is a multiple-choice Written Examination (WE) used to screen candidates for eligibility to take the Phase II criterion-referenced Oral Examination (OE). This study evaluates the predictive validity of the WE in relationship to examinee performance on the OE, using an experimental sample of examinees who took the tests concurrently. Results indicate that the WE correlates appropriately with performance on the OE (.648 and .676 for the English and Spanish subtests respectively). Nearly all of those who failed the WE also failed the OE, although several false negatives were identified. However, when the data were reanalysed using a lower cut score for the Phase I WE, nearly all false negatives were eliminated. A follow-up study replicated the findings with a different sample. The authors discuss the advantages and disadvantages of lowering the passing score on the screening test in light of their findings. The study and subsequent discussion provide an example of how an established passing score can be reconsidered and modified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm lures people to produce false memories. Two experiments examined whether induced positive or negative moods would influence this false memory effect. The affect-as-information hypothesis predicts that, on the one hand, positive affective cues experienced as task-relevant feedback encourage relational processing during encoding, which should enhance false memory effects. On the other hand, negative affective cues are hypothesized to encourage item-specific processing at encoding, which should discourage such effects. The results of Experiment 1 are consistent with these predictions: Individuals in negative moods were significantly less likely to show false memory effects than those in positive moods or those whose mood was not manipulated. Experiment 2 introduced inclusion instructions to investigate whether moods had their effects at encoding or retrieval. The results replicated the false memory finding of Experiment 1 and provide evidence that moods influence the accessibility of lures at encoding, rather than influencing monitoring at retrieval of whether lures were actually presented.

Abstract = {Functional analysis test conditions typically manipulate a single antecedent variable and an associated consequence to better isolate response-reinforcer relations. In some instances no problem behavior is observed, perhaps representing a false-negative finding. The present study evaluated one approach to assess potentially false-negative findings within functional analyses. Participants were exposed to single-antecedent functional analysis test conditions and combined-antecedent test conditions within a multielement design. Both participants engaged in problem behavior primarily during the combined-antecedent test conditions, and treatments matched to the results were effective in reducing problem behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of clinical implications of combining antecedent variables to further examine potentially false-negative functional analysis results.

Abstract = {Identifying crash "hotspots", "blackspots", "sites with promise", or "high risk" locations is standard practice in departments of transportation throughout the US. The literature is replete with the development and discussion of statistical methods for hotspot identification (HSID). Theoretical derivations and empirical studies have been used to weigh the benefits of various HSID methods; however, a small number of studies have used controlled experiments to systematically assess various methods. Using experimentally derived simulated data--which are argued to be superior to empirical data, three hot spot identification methods observed in practice are evaluated: simple ranking, confidence interval, and Empirical Bayes. Using simulated data, sites with promise are known a priori, in contrast to empirical data where high risk sites are not known for certain. To conduct the evaluation, properties of observed crash data are used to generate simulated crash frequency distributions at hypothetical sites. A variety of factors is manipulated to simulate a host of 'real world' conditions. Various levels of confidence are explored, and false positives (identifying a safe site as high risk) and false negatives (identifying a high risk site as safe) are compared across methods. Finally, the effects of crash history duration in the three HSID approaches are assessed. The results illustrate that the Empirical Bayes technique significantly outperforms ranking and confidence interval techniques (with certain caveats). As found by others, false positives and negatives are inversely related. Three years of crash history appears, in general, to provide an appropriate crash history duration.

Abstract = {Who is likely to have a false memory? Does being in a certain transient state, such as a negative mood, mean that a person is more like to have a false memory? These important questions are examined using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) procedure. The amount of false memories was compared with people's score on a dissociation measure and by mood. Unlike past research, which has used different procedures to explore false memories, we found that dissociation was not associated with false memories. We argue that this is because the DRM procedure requires two processes for a false memory (the generation of the critical lure and mistaking its source), while most false memory procedures only require one process (source monitoring error) because the errant information is suggested to the participant. This pattern of results suggests that only errors with the source monitoring process are associated with dissociation. We found that mood was related to false memories, but it was dependent on the specific task demands. If participants were told to recall as many words as they could, then people in a negative mood had more false memories. However, if they were told to recall as many words as they felt like recalling, then there were more false memories for people in a positive mood. This can be explained by the mood-as-input hypothesis. Results are discussed in relation to both theories and applications of memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the utility of a teacher-rating instrument (Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Revised [TOCA-R]) of aggressive behavior during elementary school years in identifying girls at risk of later criminal court violence. Method: A community epidemiological sample of 845 urban public school girls was rated at six time points during elementary school regarding their level of aggressive/disruptive behavior (75% of whom were African American). Criminal violence was measured using juvenile court records. Logistic regression was used to study the strength of the association between early indicators of aggressive behavior and adolescent females' violent outcomes. An extension of the traditional receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to study the accuracy of identifying girls at risk of violence under three different screening and intervention scenarios. Results: For girls, teacher ratings of aggression were a strong and consistent predictor of later violence across grades 1-5 and were strongest in fifth grade. Three screening scenarios were compared to determine the optimal identification threshold. The screening scenario with a focus on minimizing false negatives yielded the highest value (K = 0.803). Conclusions: This study supports other studies indicating that early levels of aggressive behavior are strong and robust predictors of later violence among girls but are of limited utility in the early identification of girls at risk, especially when the focus is on reducing both false positives and negatives.

Abstract = {Backgrounds. - Although the epidemiology of Eating Disorders (ED) has been highly developed in Spain, further research considering false negatives and also the prevalence of these disorders in males are needed. They were the aims of the present study. Methods. - One thousand and seventy six adolescents (500 males and 576 females) participated in a two-stage survey. At the age of 13, apart from exploring numerous clinical and psychosocial variables, they were assessed by means of self-administered screening instruments, the eating attitude test (EAT), bulimic investigatory test Edinburgh (BITE), and body shape questionnaire (BSQ). The subjects were interviewed again 2 years later. Afterwards, 159 probable cases and 150 controls were interviewed by means of the structured interview SCAN. Results. - Prevalence of ED in adolescents was 3.71% (95% CI 2.58-4.83; 6.4% of females, 0.6% of males): anorexia nervosa 0.1%, bulimia nervosa 0.75%, eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) = 2.88%. The rate of false negative was 2.6% of the control group and most of them were EDNOS. Conclusions. - The prevalence of ED obtained in our study, higher than others found in previous Spanish research, and a relatively high percentage of false negatives both indicate that up to now the prevalence of ED in Spanish adolescents could be underestimated.

Abstract = {Objective: To assess inter-rater reliability between different scorers, from different qualified sleep research groups, in scoring visually the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP), to evaluate the performances of a new tool for the computer-assisted detection of CAP, and to compare its output with the data from the different scorers. Methods: CAP was scored in 11 normal sleep recordings by four different raters, coming from three sleep laboratories. CAP was also scored in the same recordings by means of a new computer-assisted method, implemented in the Hypnolab 1.2 (SWS Soft, Italy) software. Data analysis was performed according to the following steps: (a) the inter-rater reliability of CAP parameters between the four different scorers was carried out by means of the Kendall W coefficient of concordance; (b) the analysis of the agreement between the results of the visual and computer-assisted analysis of CAP parameters was also carried out by means of the Kendall W coefficient; (c) a 'consensus' scoring was obtained, for each recording, from the four scorings provided by the different raters, based on the score of the majority of scorers; (d) the degree of agreement between each scorer and the consensus score and between the computer-assisted analysis and the consensus score was quantified by means of the Cohen's k coefficient; (e) the differences between the number of false positive and false negative detections obtained in the visual and in the computer-assisted analysis were also evaluated by means of the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Results: The inter-rater reliability of CAP parameters quantified by the Kendall W coefficient of concordance between the four different scorers was high for all the parameters considered and showed values above 0.9 for total CAP time, CAP time in sleep stage 2 and percentage of A phases in sequence; also CAP rate showed a high value (0.829). The most important global parameters of CAP, including total CAP rate and CAP time, scored by the computer-assisted analysis showed a significant concordance with those obtained by the raters. The agreement between the computer-assisted analysis and the consensus scoring for the assignment of the CAP A phase subtype was not distinguishable from that expected from a human scorer. However, the computer-assisted analysis provided a number of false positives and false negatives significantly higher than that of the visual scoring of CAP. Conclusions: CAP scoring shows good inter-rater reliability and might be compared in different laboratories the results of which might also be pooled together; however, caution should always be taken because of the variability which can be expected in the classical sleep staging. The computer-assisted detection of CAP can be used with some supervision and correction in large studies when only general parameters such as CAP rate are considered; more editing is necessary for the correct use of the other results. Significance: This article describes the first attempt in the literature to evaluate in a detailed way the inter-rater reliability in scoring CAP parameters of normal sleep and the performances of a human-supervised computerized automatic detection system.

Abstract = {Given the high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among substance users, integrated programs that target PTSD and substance use are recommended as best practice. To effectively implement such treatments, accurate and reliable PTSD screening instruments are needed. Unfortunately, no standardized PTSD measure has been validated among women substance abusers. Therefore, the goal of this investigation was to examine the psychometric utility of two PTSD measures to optimize the number of women clients correctly identified as meeting diagnostic criterion for PTSD. Forty-four women in residential substance use treatment were administered diagnostic interviews for PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) and then completed questionnaires regarding trauma exposure and related symptoms. In this group, 38.6% of the participants met diagnostic criteria for current PTSD. A score of 38 and above on the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and a Penn Inventory score of 25 and above optimally maximized the number of women with PTSD identified and minimized false negative and false positive rates.

Abstract = {Objective: According to the DSM-IV TR, approximately 3 to 7% of school-age children meet the criteria for ADHD. However, there is a common conception that ADHD is overdiagnosed. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the evidence for and against overdiagnosis. Method: Recent prevalence studies and research on factors affecting diagnostic accuracy were reviewed. For ADHD to be overdiagnosed, the rate of false positives (i.e., children inappropriately diagnosed with ADHD) must substantially exceed the number of false negatives (children with ADHD who are not identified or diagnosed). Results and Conclusion: Based on the review of prevalence studies and research on the diagnostic process, there does not appear to be sufficient justification for the conclusion that ADHD is systematically overdiagnosed. Yet, this conclusion is generally not reflected in public perceptions or media coverage of ADHD. Potential explanations for the persistence of the belief in the overdiagnosis of ADHD are offered.

Abstract = {The watersheds method is a powerful segmentation tool developed in mathematical morphology, which has the drawback of producing over-segmentation. In this paper, in order to prevent its over-segmentation, we present a strategy to obtain robust markers for image segmentation of atherosclerotic lesions of the thoracic aorta. In such sense, we introduced an algorithm, which was very useful in order to obtain the markers of the atherosclerotic lesions. Images were pre-processed using the Gauss filter and a contrast enhancement. The obtained results by using our strategy were validated calculating the false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) according to criterion of physicians, where 0% for FN and less than 11% for FP were obtained. Extensive experimentation showed that, using real image data, the proposed strategy was very suitable for our application. These images will be subject to an additional morphometrical analysis in order to study automatically the atherosclerosis and its organic-consequences.

Abstract = {Classification is a frequently encountered data mining problem. Decision tree techniques have been widely used to build classification models as such models closely resemble human reasoning and are easy to understand. Many real-world classification problems are cost-sensitive, meaning that different types of misclassification errors are not equally costly. Since different decision trees may excel under different cost settings, a set of non-dominated decision trees should be developed and presented to the decision maker for consideration, if the costs of different types of misclassification errors are not precisely determined. This paper proposes a multi-objective genetic programming approach to developing such alternative Pareto optimal decision trees. It also allows the decision maker to specify partial preferences on the conflicting objectives, such as false negative vs. false positive, sensitivity vs. specificity, and recall vs. precision, to further reduce the number of alternative solutions. A diabetes prediction problem and a credit card application approval problem are used to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.

Abstract = {It has been proposed that selection has shaped the human mind to be predictably biased in domains where the costs of false-positive and false-negative errors have been asymmetrical throughout human evolutionary history. Using this logic, the current study predicts that men and women systematically overestimate the degree to which members of the opposite sex find their same-sex mating competition desirable. Ten photographs of opposite-sex targets were shown to a sample of men (n = 123) and women (n = 159), and they were asked questions pertaining to each target's desirability as a mate. The same photographs, this time with sex of target and participant being the same, were shown to a second group of men (n = 105) and women (n = 103), and they were asked to estimate the desirability of the depicted individuals to members of the opposite sex. Consistent with the mate competition overestimation bias hypothesis, men and women consistently overestimated the degree to which members of the opposite sex find members of their same sex attractive and desirable as potential mates.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher (2007). Jay Asher’s book opens with the main character Clay deciding how to mail a collection of 13 cassette tapes to a high school teacher. Clay listens to the first of these tapes as a young woman’s voice, that of the late Hannah Baker, both readies and shocks the reader, stating, “I hope you’re ready, because I’m about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you’re listening to these tapes, you’re one of the reasons why” (p. 7). With a mysteriously haunting tone, this book leads us through tapes that Hannah created for each one of the 13 individuals to listen to after her death. Each tape exposes an individual’s part in Hannah’s decision to commit suicide. Thus we eagerly await how the human pieces of this “people puzzle” fit together and apparently compelled this teen to commit suicide. Although the reader may be hoping for causal links to Hannah’s death, there is no clear, singular cause. Instead, an overwhelming accumulation of negative social events, false rumors, missed opportunities, and misconstrued moments befall Hannah. In the end, I felt that Asher’s deliberate concatenation of social slights, mishaps, and physical mishandlings of Hannah was, at best, overwrought. The book would be much more powerful if the author could help the reader to understand how Hannah understood and interpreted the meaning of all of the slights that seemed to come at such an alarming frequency, and what forces drove her behavior.

This study investigated 795 individuals, 563 with direct genotype and phenotype information, forming 139 pedigrees. The study found no statistically significant phenotype-polymorphism combinations. The present study had less power to detect an association and produced false-negative results. The phenotypes were not representative of individuals with pure anxiety or mood disorders. The results did not support the polymorphisms investigated having a direct, clinically significant effect on the risk of developing the psychiatric disorders tested.

Large and Mullin described issues specific to the validation of the VRISK- 10 and structured professional judgement (SPJ) in general. Firstly, we agree that avoiding possible harm to the patient due to false positive predictions is an important issue. However, the realities of clinical practice mean that we do not have as much time as we would wish to make clinical decisions. Secondly, screening of selected populations is common in many health-care settings. Violence rates are significantly higher in acutely admitted psychiatric patients than in general psychiatry and in the general population. Thirdly, in a RCT study Abderhalden et al found that structured risk assessment during the first day of treatment reduced violence and coercion in acute psychiatric wards. Finally, our article reports the optimal cut-off level for violent threats and acts (5.5 points). For severe violence the optimal cutoff was 8.5 points (not reported in the article). The latter yielded a positive predictive value of 13%. Low rates of false negatives are important to enhance public safety, and hopefully this will contribute to less stigmatization as well.

Abstract = {This study investigates the prediction of violence in psychiatric patients through five simple questions. This study found that 30 of 128 patients were violent in the 5 years studied, with 83% being predicted as violent by screening (sensitivity), and a false negative rate of 17%. The positive predictive value was poor at 38% but the negative predictive value was impressive at 92%. The factors predicting later violence were being male, having a history of violence, a history of drug misuse, a prior criminal conviction, a history of alcohol misuse, poor treatment adherence and being less than 32 years old. A history of self-harm was only seen in 20% of those who were violent later. The rates of 5-year violence in the three separate groups were 35% in the forensic sample, 6% in addictions, and 36% in the acute community crisis resolution home treatment group. The results raised two interesting points. First, that these five simple questions might aid clinical decision-making concerning which patients will not pose a risk of later violence, but does not elucidate prediction on who will become violent. Second, it is hard to define who is a forensic patient when compared patterns across our three samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: One of the factors which directly affects quality of life (QOL) in patients with epilepsy is society's attitude toward this disease. Despite considerable progress in the treatment of epilepsy, many patients continue to experience extremely prejudiced behavior from society, even in culturally and economically developed countries. The climate accompanying epilepsy is still replete with prejudice, magic and even contempt rooted in the superstitions and witchcraft which used to exist in mediaeval Europe. This article identifies the factors that mediate the emergence and consolidation of the false and negative image of patients with epilepsy. Material/Methods: A clinical study was conducted at the Department of Neurology and Epileptology in Warsaw. We studied the determinants of changes in the emotional, cognitive and behavioural components of attitude. Results: Patients hospitalised for conditions other than epilepsy underwent a clear behavioural change and attitudinal re-evaluation with respect to patients with epilepsy. This leads to some tentative conclusions concerning the determinants and dynamics of change of attitude toward patients with epilepsy in the general population. Conclusions: Correct medical intervention in epilepsy involves not only accurate diagnosis of the type of epileptic syndrome and implementation of targeted pharmacotherapy, but also accurate diagnosis of all the elements contributing to QOL and level of satisfaction of the patients' medical, emotional and social needs.

Abstract = {Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is a direct ethanol metabolite, and has recently attracted attention as biomarker of ethanol intake. The aims of the current study are: (1) to characterize the normalization time of PEth in larger samples than previously conducted; (2) to elucidate potential gender differences; and (3) to report the correlation of PEth with other biomarkers and self-reported alcohol consumption. Fifty-seven alcohol-dependent patients (ICD 10 F 10.25; 9 females, 48 males) entering medical detoxification at three study sites were enrolled. The study sample was comprised of 48 males and 9 females, with mean age 43.5. Mean gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was 209.61 U/l, average mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 97.35 fl, mean carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT) was 8.68, and mean total ethanol intake in the last 7 days was 1653 g. PEth was measured in heparinized whole blood with a high-pressure liquid chromatography method, while GGT, MCV and %CDT were measured using routine methods. PEth levels at day 1 of detoxification ranged between 0.63 and 26.95 mol/l (6.22 mean, 4.70 median, SD 4.97). There were no false negatives at day 1. Sensitivities for the other biomarkers were 40.4% for MCV, 73.1% for GGT and 69.2% for %CDT, respectively. No gender differences were found for PEth levels at any time point. Our data suggest that PEth is (1) a suitable intermediate term marker of ethanol intake in both sexes; and (2) sensitivity is extraordinary high in alcohol dependent patients. The results add further evidence to the data that suggest that PEth has potential as a candidate for a sensitive and specific biomarker, which reflects longer-lasting intake of higher amounts of alcohol and seemingly has the above mentioned certain advantages over traditional biomarkers.

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Deepak Sharma (see record [rid]2011-14961-041[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2011-01729-011[/rid]). It is well-known that guidelines for the determination of brain death (BD) differ from one country to another. Obviously, two Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examinations are performed once again after BD clinical diagnosis, according to the Italian guidelines on this matter. Sharma’s concerns about our paper do not take in account the Italian national medical standards on BD diagnosis, which we reported as reference in our paper. Regarding the assumption that TCD is not reliable in all patients with decompressive craniectomy, in our experience, out of 22 BD patients with decompressive craniectomy, only four were false negative result due to this condition. Therefore, TCD can be useful also in these patients, even if decompressive craniectomy could be a well-known limit of the methodology, in a few cases. TCD pattern of CCA in a patient with extracorporeal life support and intra-aortic balloon pump was detected without putting the device on standby mode, according to the intensivists’ decision. In case of CCA confirmation, the Doppler waveform has to be considered rather than mean flow velocity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To study the influence of screening dementia with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) combining with delay memory test . Methods: MMSE and delay memory test are used in screening 301 residents. The diagnosis of dementia is according to the DSM-III-R criterion. The validity and reliability were studied when the MMSE and delay memory test were used to screen dementia alone or combined. Results: When MMSE was used to screen dementia alone, the specificity, sensitivity, false positive proportion and false negative proportion were 85.40%, 52.43%, 47.56% and 14.60% respectively. When delay memory test was used to screen dementia alone, the specificity, sensitivity, false positive proportion and false negative proportion were 74.45%, 92.07%, 7.93% and 25.55% respectively. If parallel connection of MMSE and delay memory test were used to screen dementia, the specificity, sensitivity, false positive proportion and false negative proportion were 95.62%, 49.39%, 50.61% and 4.38% respectively. If MMSE was in series with delay memory test, the specificity, sensitivity, false positive proportion and false negative proportion of screening dementia were 64.23%, 95.73%, 4.27% and 35.77% respectively. Conclusion: The parallel connection of MMSE and delay memory test can elevate sensitivity of screening dementia and decrease false negative proportion, so it is important in epidemiologic investigation. MMSE in series with delay memory test will raise specificity of screening dementia and decrease false positive proportion, so it is useful for diagnosing early dementia.

Abstract = {We developed a polyclonal antiserum directed to the γ-isoform of the human 14-3-3 protein and compared the immunoreactivity with a commercially available antibody (CG31). We analysed 14-3-3 in 253 cerebrospinal fluid samples blinded for the diagnosis by western blot and ELISA, with a commonly used polyclonal antiserum (Sc-731) and the γ specific antibodies. Our patient population consisted of 52 patients with definite sporadic Creulzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and 201 patients with a different final diagnosis. We obtained similar sensitivity, ranging from 96% to 98% with all antibodies. Of all the samples that wore false positive with Sc-731, 50% were negative with both γ-isoform specific antibodies resulting in a significantly higher specificity (85% v 93%, respectively), if only sCJD and patients with dementia differing from sCJD were analysed we found that 64% of false positives were negative which also resulted in significantly increased specificity and positive predictive value. The γ-isoform specific antibodies strongly improve the specificity of the immunoblot and might improve worldwide acceptance of the use of the 14-3-3 assay in the differential diagnosis of sCJD.

Abstract = {Introduction: People with mental disorders experience discrimination as a consequence of stigmatising attitudes that are largely socio-culturally constructed. Thus, there is a need to understand local contexts in order to develop effective programs to change such attitudes. We undertook a mental health literacy survey in rural Maharashtra, India, prior to developing a mental health training program for village health workers (VHWs) in a primary health care setting. Methods: A cross-sectional mental health literacy survey was undertaken in late 2007, which involved interviewer-administration of a questionnaire to 240 systematically sampled community members, and 60 purposively sampled VHWs. Participants were presented with two vignettes describing people experiencing symptoms of mental disorders (depression, psychosis), and were asked about attitudes towards, and desired social distance from, the people in the vignettes (the latter being a proxy measure for stigma). Linear regression modelling was undertaken to identify predictors of social distance. Results: Although the community was relatively accepting of people with mental disorders, false beliefs and negative attitudes were still evident. Desired social distance was consistently greater for the person depicted in the psychosis vignette compared to the depression vignette. For both vignettes, the main predictor of greater social distance was perceiving the person as dangerous, and the predictors of reduced social distance were being a VHW, and seeing the problem as a sign of personal weakness. For depression, believing the cause to be family tensions also reduced social distance. For psychosis, labelling the disorder as a mind/brain problem, and believing the cause to be lack of control over life or genetic factors increased social distance. The vast majority did not agree that the problems experienced in the vignettes were ‘a real medical illness’. Conclusion: Promoting bio-medical explanations for mental disorders in this setting may exacerbate discriminatory attitudes. Provision of contextually relevant mental health training for the VHWs so that they are able to communicate, model and shape more positive attitudes is the next step.

Each measure achieved high overall diagnostic accuracy, yet each contributed differently to suboptimal effort detection. False-negative classifications varied by measure, yet no simulator went undetected by all three tests. The WMT and WRT identified different members of the presumed honest LD group as demonstrating poor effort, whereas the TOMM identified none. Each measure contributed unique variance in a logistic regression, with effort status best predicted by WMT Consistency. Findings provided preliminary evidence that all three measures may be useful when assessing effort during postsecondary LD evaluations. Implications for future practice and research are discussed.

Abstract = {There is a growing literature on brain activity in the nonpsychotic first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia as measured using functional imaging. This systematic review examined 20 studies in 4 domains of cognition, including cognitive control (7 samples), working memory (5 samples), long-term memory (4 samples), and language (4 samples). While the literature was widely divergent, these studies did consistently find activation differences between patients’ relatives and controls. The most consistent increases in activation within hemisphere were found in right ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right parietal cortex. Abnormal activity, defined as significant increases or decreases in activation relative to controls irrespective of hemisphere, was found in about two-thirds of contrasts in the cerebellum, dorsal prefrontal, lateral temporal, and parietal cortices, and thalamus, with basal ganglia and ventral PFC showing abnormalities in approximately half of those contrasts. Anterior cingulate was generally spared in patients’ relatives. The diversity of findings in studies of patients’ relatives may derive from differences between the cognitive demands across studies. We identify avenues for building a more accurate and cumulative literature, including symmetrical inclusion criteria for relatives and controls, recording in-scanner responses, using both a priori and whole-brain tests, explicitly reporting threshold values, reporting main effects of task, reporting effect sizes, and quantifying the risk of false negatives. While functional imaging in the relatives of schizophrenia patients remains a promising methodology for understanding the impact of the unexpressed genetic liability to schizophrenia, no single region or mechanism of abnormalities has yet emerged.

Abstract = {Resting-state data sets contain coherent fluctuations unrelated to neural processes originating from residual motion artefacts, respiration and cardiac action. Such confounding effects may introduce correlations and cause an overestimation of functional connectivity strengths. In this study we applied several multidimensional linear regression approaches to remove artificial coherencies and examined the impact of preprocessing on sensitivity and specificity of functional connectivity results in simulated data and resting-state data sets from 40 subjects. Furthermore, we aimed at clarifying possible causes of anticorrelations and test the hypothesis that anticorrelations are introduced via certain preprocessing approaches, with particular focus on the effects of regression against the global signal. Our results show that preprocessing in general greatly increased connection specificity, in particular correction for global signal fluctuations almost doubled connection specificity. However, widespread anticorrelated networks were only found when regression against the global signal was applied. Results in simulated data sets compared with result of human data strongly suggest that anticorrelations are indeed introduced by global signal regression and should therefore be interpreted very carefully. In addition, global signal regression may also reduce the sensitivity for detecting true correlations, i.e. increase the number of false negatives. Concluding from our results we suggest that is highly recommended to apply correction against realignment parameters, white matter and ventricular time courses, as well as the global signal to maximize the specificity of positive resting-state correlations.

Abstract = {Background: A vital component of an organism's response to acute stress is a surge in vigilance that serves to optimize the detection and assessment of threats to its homeostasis. The amygdala is thought to regulate this process, but in humans, acute stress and amygdala function have up to now only been studied in isolation. Hence, we developed an integrated design using functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the immediate effects of controlled stress induction on amygdala function. Methods: In 27 healthy female participants, we studied brain responses to emotional facial stimuli, embedded in an either acutely stressful or neutral context by means of adjoining movie clips. Results: A variety of physiological and psychological measures confirmed successful induction of moderate levels of acute stress. More importantly, this context manipulation shifted the amygdala toward higher sensitivity as well as lower specificity, that is, stress induction augmented amygdala responses to equally high levels for threat-related and positively valenced stimuli, thereby diminishing a threat-selective response pattern. Additionally, stress amplified sensory processing in early visual regions and the face responsive area of the fusiform gyrus but not in a frontal region involved in task execution. Conclusions: A shift of amygdala function toward heightened sensitivity with lower levels of specificity suggests a state of indiscriminate hypervigilance under stress. Although this represents initial survival value in adverse situations where the risk for false negatives in the detection of potential threats should be minimized, it might similarly play a causative role in the sequelae of traumatic events.

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to compare the proportion of obesity-related diagnoses in clinical encounters (N = 1874) documented by nurses using a personal digital assistant-based log with and without obesity decision support features. The experimental group encounters in the randomized controlled trial had significantly more (P = .000) obesity-related diagnoses (11.3%) than did the control group encounters (1%) and a significantly lower false negative rate (24.5% vs 66.5%, P = .000). The study findings provide evidence that integration of a decision support feature that automatically calculates an obesity-related diagnosis increases diagnoses and decreases missed diagnoses and suggest that such systems have the potential to improve the quality of obesity-related care.

Abstract = {Background: The validity of a self-reported stroke remains inconclusive. Objective: To validate the diagnosis of self-reported stroke using stroke identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the standard. Design, Setting, and Participants: Community-based cohort study of nondemented, ethnically diverse elderly persons in northern Manhattan. Methods: High-resolution quantitative MRIs were acquired for 717 participants without dementia. Sensitivity and specificity of stroke by self-report were examined using cross-sectional analyses and the Χ² test. Putative relationships between factors potentially influencing the reporting of stroke, including memory performance, cognitive function, and vascular risk factors, were assessed using logistic regression models. Subsequently, all analyses were repeated, stratified by age, sex, ethnic group, and level of education. Results: In analyses of the whole sample, sensitivity of stroke self-report for a diagnosis of stroke on MRI was 32.4%, and specificity was 78.9%. In analyses stratified by median age (80.1 years), the validity between reported stroke and detection of stroke on MRI was significantly better in the younger than the older age group (for all vascular territories: sensitivity and specificity, 36.7% and 81.3% vs 27.6% and 26.2%; P = .02). Impaired memory, cognitive skills, or language ability and the presence of hypertension or myocardial infarction were associated with higher rates of false-negative results. Conclusions: Using brain MRI as the standard, specificity and sensitivity of stroke self-report are low. Accuracy of self-report is influenced by age, presence of vascular disease, and cognitive function. In stroke research, sensitive neuroimaging techniques rather than stroke self-report should be used to determine stroke history. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Aims: The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) is an instrument that has obtained reliability and validity in some countries for use in detecting depersonalization disorder under clinical conditions, but not yet in Japan under non-psychiatric conditions. The purposes of this study were to develop a Japanese version of the CDS (J-CDS) and to examine its reliability and validity as an instrument for screening depersonalization disorder under non-clinical conditions. Methods: The CDS was translated from English into Japanese and then back-translated into English by a native English-speaking American. After making the J-CDS, we examined its reliability and validity. Questionnaires that were composed of J-CDS, the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES), the Zung self-rating scale and the Maudsley Obsessional–Compulsive Inventory were administrated to 59 participants (12 patients with depersonalization disorder, 11 individuals who had recovered from depersonalization and 36 healthy controls). Results: Cronbach’s alpha and split-half reliability were 0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The J-CDS score in the depersonalization group was significantly higher than in the healthy control group. The J-CDS score was significantly correlated with scores of total DES, and DES-depersonalization. The best compromise between the true positive and false negative rate was at a cut-off point of 60, yielding a sensitivity of 1.00 and a specificity of 0.96. Conclusions: In this study, J-CDS showed good reliability and validity. The best cut-off point, when we use this for distinguishing individuals with depersonalization disorder from individuals without psychiatric disorders, is 60 points.

Abstract = {Objective: Muscle ultrasound is capable of visualizing muscle movements. Recent improvements in ultrasound technology have raised the question whether it is also possible to detect small-scale spontaneous muscle activity such as denervation. In this study we investigated the ability of dynamic muscle ultrasound to detect fibrillations. Methods: Eight patients with fibrillations were measured simultaneously by ultrasound and EMG to verify which movements on ultrasound examination corresponded to fibrillation potentials on EMG. The temperature dependency of ultrasound detected fibrillations and the observer agreement was assessed in five healthy subjects with focal denervation induced by botulinum toxin. Results: Fibrillations appeared on ultrasound examination as small, irregularly oscillating movements within the muscle while the overall shape of the muscle remains undisturbed. Visibility of fibrillations with ultrasound decreased with lower temperatures, with a 32% decrease at 30 °C compared to 39 °C. The interobserver agreement was substantial with a kappa of 0.65 for experienced observers. Conclusion: Fibrillations could be visualized with ultrasound. Consistent results could be obtained from trained observers. Care has to be taken to ensure an optimal muscle temperature to avoid false negative results, especially in distal muscles. Significance: Visualization of fibrillations by muscle ultrasound opens the way for a new diagnostic application of this technique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Introduction. A precise characterization of erectile dysfunction (ED) of vascular origin has not yet been achieved. Although cavernous peak systolic velocity (PSV) is generally considered a major parameter, it has many false positives and negatives because of anatomic variations of the cavernous artery course, challenging site of sampling, insufficient caracterization of an early phase of vascular disease, and significant influence of adrenergic tone. Aim. We performed a high magnification ultrasonographic study in order to compare functional and morphological parameters of the cavernous artery to PSV and their relation with penile and systemic atherosclerosis. Methods. A total of 109 subjects (84 ED patients and 25 controls) evaluated in our andrological center from March 2007 to January 2008 were enrolled in the study. Main Outcome Measures. All subjects underwent medical history, erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function, physical examination, routine and sex hormone blood tests, and high resolution echo color doppler evaluation of carotid, femoral and penile districts (acceleration time, intima media thickness [IMT], intima adventitia thickness, caliper before and after intracavernous alprostadil injection [Δ-cavernous calliper]). Results. Cavernous parameters were significantly different between ED and controls. Multivariate model showed that IMT was the only predicting parameter for ED of vascular origin. Cavernous IMT showed a strong direct correlation with carotid and femoral IMT. ED patients with two or more cardiovascular risk factors had a significantly higher cavernous IMT. Conclusions. An increased cavernous IMT (≥0.3 mm) might predict ED of vascular origin with more accuracy than PSV and could be a sensitive predictor also for systemic atherosclerosis at an earlier phase.

Abstract = {In this study, we tested the ability of risk assessment and exploration behaviours to emphasise PH effects. Indeed, postnatal handling (PH) decreases emotional reactivity in rats but inconsistent behavioural results can be observed and may be due to false negative (i.e. existing effects are not detected). Risk assessment behaviours were measured in the elevated plus maze, in the free exploration paradigm and in the open field. In addition, we measured object exploration behaviours towards familiar/new objects in the open field. PH increased general activity in the elevated plus maze and in the free exploration paradigm and risk assessment behaviours allowed demonstrating that these effects were specific to emotional reactivity. In the open field, PH increased object exploration as early as first exposition while general activity was unaffected. PH also decreased behavioural inhibition in response to the introduction of a novel object. On the whole, our results show that risk assessment and object exploration behaviours are valuable tools to measure more precisely emotional reactivity in rodents. This reinforces the idea that these behaviours should be used more frequently in order to avoid false negative when emotional reactivity changes are expected in unconditioned conflict tests.

Abstract = {Risk assessment instruments are increasingly used in child protection work. Users need to understand how accurate they are. Instruments can err in two ways: producing a false positive (where non-dangerous families are assessed as high risk) and a false negative (where a dangerous family is judged to be safe). The crucial question in practice is 'if this family receives a high risk assessment score, how likely is this to be a true result?' The calculation is usually presented in a mathematical way that people have difficulty in understanding. This article outlines an alternative method for understanding the accuracy of an instrument that is easier to understand intuitively and to apply in practice. The importance of knowing the levels of false positives and negatives is then discussed. The pressures on child protection agencies to avoid any mistakes can lead to defensive practice where it is tempting to place an unwarranted degree of confidence in the results of risk assessment instruments as a means of avoiding individual blame.

Abstract = {Episodic recognition memory for odors, faces, and unfamiliar symbols was assessed in apolipoprotein ε4 positive and ε4 negative individuals with pathologically-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD), individuals diagnosed with probable AD, and healthy age-and gender-matched controls. The analyses revealed significant differences in performance between the AD patients and nondemented elderly controls based on the presence of the ε4 allele and the modality of the stimulus to be remembered. Measures of hits did not discriminate among groups but an analysis of false positive errors revealed significant differences, particularly for olfactory stimuli. Nondemented ε4 negative controls committed fewer false positive errors for olfactory stimuli compared to all other groups. In contrast, nondemented ε4 positive controls committed false positive errors for olfactory stimuli at rates similar to the AD patients. The performance of ε4 positive and ε4 negative controls was indistinguishable on the visual recognition memory tasks suggesting the particular vulnerability of olfactory memory to the early neuropathology of AD resulting in false positive errors in recognition memory for olfactory stimuli. The results of the present study offer new insight into how recognition memory is affected by AD, the ε4 allele, and the modality of the stimulus to be remembered.

Abstract = {Background: This study aims to replicate the sensitivity and specificity of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) for bipolar disorder and assess the impact of insight on the MDQ's sensitivity. Unlike prior telephone-based validation, this is the first clinical study to assess the validity of the MDQ. Methods: 37 consecutive patients with bipolar spectrum illness received the MDQ, as well as 36 consecutive patients with unipolar depression. MDQ diagnoses were compared to DSM-IV-based SCID diagnoses. A total of 16 bipolar patients also received the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD) to measure insight. Results: Overall sensitivity for the MDQ was 0.58, higher in bipolar I disorder (0.69) than in bipolar II/NOS (0.30, P=0.06). The sample was highly insightful, but the two patients with lowest insight both had false negative screens. Patients' low ratings of severity of mania (question 3 of the MDQ) explained almost half of all false negative results. Specificity was 0.67. Conclusions: The MDQ demonstrates good sensitivity in insightful patients with bipolar I disorder, but may be less useful in patients with impaired insight or milder bipolar spectrum conditions.

Abstract = {Amodel for certain instances of dyadic extrasensory perception (ESP) is proposed wherein a "psi stimulus" is generated by a sender in response to real-time feedback of target-relevant receiver mentation. This stimulus need act only to reinforce current mentation by momentarily changing physiological arousal, reducing the need for complex information transfer, and highlighting the idea that psi may be a blanket term for a variety of information channels utilising different mechanisms rather than a unitary phenomenon. Experimental evaluation of the model involved two extensions to the standard ganzfeld design: (1) in one condition the sender received false feedback of receiver mentation; (2) receiver skin-conductance was recorded during mentation. No evidence of ESP was found based on target-rank (pi=.49) but the predicted skin-conductance response to target-relevant mentation was observed, with significantly higher arousal for relevant mentation than in baseline periods (p=.04, one-tailed). Arousal was increased in both conditions, indicating a response to the sender's perception rather than directly to target-relevant mentation. The true-feedback condition showed a surprising negative correlation with magnetic variance (p=.06 but opposite to prediction), and only the false-feedback condition showed the predicted negative correlation with magnetic field intensity (p=.002, one-tailed).

In their commentary, Christian Kieling et al. presented the rationale for a DSM–5 proposal to increase the required age at onset for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from age 7 years to 12 years. Unfortunately, the commentary did not include a risk/benefit analysis. The authors focus only on the benefit of reducing false negatives and ignore the considerable risk that eliminating this age of onset gatekeeper will result in a flood of new false positives for a diagnosis that may already be quite overinclusive. Especially in adolescents and adults, real or perceived attention problems are so common and so nonspecific that ADHD can be easily overdiagnosed in those suffering from any number of other mental disorders and in those who are merely seeking performance enhancement.

Abstract = {Comments on an article, The prediction of imminent aggression in patients with mental illness and/or intellectual disability using the Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression instrument by J. Barry-Walsh et al. (2009). The authors state in the abstract of their paper that the Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression (DASA) instrument allows that imminent aggression in psychiatric hospitals may be able to be accurately predicted by psychiatric nurses because the prediction of any aggressive behavior irrespective of type of aggression was significantly greater than chance. Using the prevalence of aggression in their study (2.6%) and this superior sensitivity and specifi city, the ratio of false positive predictions to true positive predictions is about 10 to 1; that is, 10 patients are falsely labeled as dangerous for every patient who will in fact go on to be aggressive – all with the attendant stigma and the lost opportunity to assist or understand the patient. In their study, false negative predictions were also common – half the episodes of aggression were preceded by a DASA score of zero. There is almost no empirical evidence that the current vogue for risk assessment has resulted in reduction in aggression or increase in safety.

The cost-effectiveness of this new approach versus the classical approach should be demonstrated. The major question is whether the new technique is a time-consuming and easy-to-use procedure in clinical practice. It should be noted that not all gliomas possess IDH1/2 mutations; other kinds of brain tumors can also possess IDH mutations.

The study by Sachse and Von Suchodoletz compares the accuracy and diagnostic power of 2 diagnostic tests for early identification of language delay: a parent report measure (ELFRA-2) and direct language assessment (SETK-2). In our view, the approach taken for calculating diagnostic measures should be viewed critically. This problem arises from the calculation of diagnostic measures on the basis of a subsample of ELFRA-2-negative children. Extracting only a subsample is understandable for cost reasons. However, if not all children with negative index test results are verified by the reference standard this may result in an overestimation of sensitivity, as not all children with false-negative results will be detected.

Abstract = {It is often necessary to dichotomize a continuous scale to separate respondents into normal and abnormal groups. However, because the distributions of the scores in these-2 groups most often overlap, any cut point that is chosen will result in 2 types of errors: false negatives (that is, abnormal cases judged to be normal) and false positives (that is, normal cases placed in the abnormal group). Changing the cut point will alter the numbers of erroneous judgments but will not eliminate the problem. A technique called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves allows us to determine the ability of a test to discriminate between groups, to choose the optimal cut point, and to compare the performance of 2 or more tests. We discuss how to calculate and compare ROC curves and the factors that must be considered in choosing an optimal cut point. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Empirical studies of violence and mental illness have used many different methods. Current state-of-the-art methods gather information from both subject and collateral interviews as well as official records. Typically these sources are treated as additive. Any report of a violent incident from any source is treated as true and all reported incidents are added to generate estimates of frequency. This paper presents a new statistical technique that uses the level of agreement between the sources of data to adjust those estimates. The evidence suggests that, although the additive technique for using multiple sources correctly estimates how many people are involved, it substantially underestimates the number of incidents. The new technique substantially reduces both false negatives and false positives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Prior early prediction models for antipsychotic treatment response demonstrate good specificity but poor sensitivity (i.e., high false-negative rates). The purpose of this study was to refine the early prediction model in schizophrenia patients taking an atypical antipsychotic agent, zotepine. Method: 135 acutely ill inpatients with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia received 4 weeks of 150 mg/day zotepine treatment. Psychopathology severity was assessed weekly with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and subscales for positive, negative, and general symptoms. Clinical response was defined as a reduction of 20% or more in the BPRS total score at week 4. A logistic regression model was used to obtain early predictors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was employed to determine the optimal cutoff points of the variables for predicting response. The study was conducted from June 2004 to April 2005. Results: The most significant early predictors for ultimate response at week 4 were BPRS positive subscale score changes at week 1 and, better, at week 2 (p < .001 at both timepoints). At week 1, a BPRS positive score reduction of 4 appeared to be the optimal cutoff point for predicting eventual response, providing a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 0.77. At week 2, a BPRS positive score reduction of 6 was the best for prediction, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.91. Conclusions: These findings suggest that using the first 2 weeks' improvement in positive symptoms to predict the fourth week's treatment response is favorable in terms of both specificity and sensitivity. Further studies are needed. Moreover, whether this model could be applied to establish a prediction system for other antipsychotics or other psychotropics also deserves research.

Abstract = {Processes of attitude learning were investigated through a game requiring discrimination between good and bad objects, where feedback about object valence (involving gain or loss) is contingent on approach. Previous research demonstrates a preponderance of false-negative errors, with some good objects ('learning asymmetry') and most novel objects ('generalization asymmetry') being judged as bad, but provides no direct evidence concerning how participants appraise alternative strategies and their own performance. To compare alternative strategies, participants received advice, supposedly from a previous participant, that most objects were bad and should be avoided, or good and should be approached. Learning and generalization asymmetries were replicated, especially among participants who followed the former (risk-averse) advice. Additionally, participants' evaluations of their own game strategy were inversely related to amount of negative feedback (the number of bad objects approached), but unrelated to positive feedback (from good objects approached), pointing to the salience of negative information for self-appraisals.

Abstract = {Background: Hearing loss (HL) is likely to be the most common congenital abnormality in humans, with a reported prevalence of 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. Early detection and intervention is critical to prevent the adverse consequences of a delayed diagnosis on speech, language and cognitive development. As 33-50% of all congenital HLs cannot be detected in a selective hearing risk, use of universal neonatal hearing screening (UNHS) programs is expanding. Aims: We tested the value of a UNHS protocol, based on a two-stage strategy of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAEs) in all infants, followed by diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing in those infants who did not meet TEOAE pass criteria and those infants at high risk for hearing loss. Methods: TEOAES (292 DP Echoport OAE Analyzer) served as the initial screen, followed by diagnostic ABR (Amplaid MK12) in newborns that did not meet pass criteria for TEOAEs. Additionally, all infants at high audiologic risk according to the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing received a diagnostic ABR evaluation. Of 21,125 total live births, 19,700 were tested (April 1, 1998-July 31, 2006). Accuracy of the UNHS strategy in predicting congenital HL was evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Results: Prevalence for all HLs in the neonatal period was 1.78/1000 l.b. (35/19,700), with bilateral HL in 1.42/1000 l.b. (28/19,700) [low risk rate: 0.43/1000 l.b. (8/18,356); high risk infants rate: 14.88/1000 l.b. (20/1344)]. All the HL infants were diagnosed <3 and received intervention <6 months age. ROC curves results showed 100% sensitivity (95% C.I.: 89.0-100) and 99.3% specificity (95% C.I.: 99.2-99.4) of the two-stage strategy in detecting congenital HLs [area under the ROC curve: 0.997 (95% C.I.: 0.995-0.997)]. Conclusions: (1) The epidemiology of congenital HLs widely justifies UNHS; (2) a two-stage TEOAE and diagnostic ABR screening for congenital HL is feasible, minimally invasive and accurate in the early detection of congenital HL; and (3) a congenital HL screening strategy based exclusively on the use of TEOAEs should always consider the possibility of false negative cases.

Abstract = {Having a satisfying romantic relationship is not always feasible, particularly as one discovers less-than-perfect partner characteristics. It is suggested that less committed couple members are more vulnerable to negative partner characteristics than are highly committed couple members. Forty-one dating couples individually indicated their commitment level, were randomly assigned to receive positive- or negative-false feedback about the partner's personality, and indicated their postmanipulation satisfaction and uncertainty levels. Negative partner feedback affected the satisfaction of less committed but not highly committed individuals. Feeling uncertain about the relationship mediated less committed couple members' increased vulnerability to negative partner information. The association between uncertainty and commitment was curvilinear and stronger under conditions of relationship threat. Self-esteem did not predict responses to threat.

Abstract = {The response-signal speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) procedure was used to investigate how proactive interference (PI) affects retrieval from working memory. Participants were presented with 6-item study lists, followed immediately by a recognition probe. A variant of a release from PI design was used: All items in a list were from the same semantic category (e.g., fruits), and the category was changed (e.g., tools) after three consecutive trials with the same category. Analysis of the retrieval functions demonstrated that PI decreased asymptotic accuracy and, crucially, also decreased the growth of accuracy over retrieval time, indicating that PI slowed retrieval speed. Analysis of false alarms to recent negatives (lures drawn from the previous study list) and distant negatives (lures not studied for 168+ trials) suggests that PI slowed retrieval by selectively eliminating fast assessments based on familiarity. There was no evidence indicating that PI affected slow processes involved with the recovery of detailed episodic information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed. The objectives of the study were to assess the psychosocial impact of current voice complaints as perceived by student-teachers with voice complaints in comparison with student-teachers without voice complaints, and to observe the pattern of risk factors in relation to their voice handicap. Subjects in the general population without a voice-demanding profession were selected as a reference group for limited comparison with the total group of student-teachers (future professional voice users). The respondents to the questionnaires were anonymous. Among the student-teachers, 17.2% reported current voice complaints in comparison with 9.7% of the reference group, and the odds ratio was 1.94, which showed the relative risk. Student-teachers had significantly greater total Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores than the reference group (P = 0.034). The VHI subscale scores were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Student-teachers who reported current voice complaints had a significantly higher total VHI and subscale scores than student teachers without voice complaints (P < 0.001). Of the student-teachers without voice complaints, 17.0% had VHI scores greater than the 75th percentile. These persons may be neglecting their voice handicap and probably represent the false-negative cases in the estimation of voice complaints. Logistic regression analysis of each of the given risk factors with the VHI as the independent variable showed that the perceived negative influence of the given risk factors on their voices was significantly greater with increasing VHI scores across the VHI range. A significant correlation was observed between the number of perceived risk factors and increasing VHI scores across the VHI range. An increased awareness of risk factors in relation to their voice handicap would serve to motivate student-teachers to change factors that contributed to their voice problem. Attention to all risk factors, which the subjects perceive to be a risk, would aid in effective management of their voice handicap. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objectives: To assess the predictive value of the St. Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling Elderly Inpatients (STRATIFY) instrument, a simple fall-risk assessment tool, when administered at a patient's hospital bedside by nurses. Design: Prospective multicenter study. Setting: Six Belgian hospitals. Participants: A total of 2,568 patients (mean age ± standard deviation 67.2 ± 18.4; 55.3% female) on four surgical (n = 875, 34.1%), eight geriatric (n = 687, 26.8%), and four general medical wards (n = 1,006, 39.2%) were included in this study upon hospital admission. All patients were hospitalized for at least 48 hours. Measurements: Nurses completed the STRATIFY within 24 hours after admission of the patient. Falls were documented on a standardized incident report form. Results: The number of fallers was 136 (5.3%), accounting for 190 falls and an overall rate of 7.3 falls per 1,000 patient days for all hospitals. The STRATIFY showed good sensitivity (≥84%) and high negative predictive value (≥99%) for the total sample, for patients admitted to general medical and surgical wards, and for patients younger than 75, although it showed moderate (69%) to low (52%) sensitivity and high false-negative rates (31-48%) for patients admitted to geriatric wards and for patients aged 75 and older. Conclusion: Although the STRATIFY satisfactorily predicted the fall risk of patients admitted to general medical and surgical wards and patients younger than 75, it failed to predict the fall risk of patients admitted to geriatric wards and patients aged 75 and older (particularly those aged 75-84).

Abstract = {Reviews the article, The development of a side effect risk assessment tool (ASYMS©-SERAT) for use in patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy by Roma Maguire et al. (see record [rid]2009-01198-006[/rid]). This is an interesting and useful piece of work developing a model of the symptom pattern during chemotherapy and verifying how this empirically-derived pattern fits with real events in terms of false positive and false negative cases. Through the process of a pilot study and based on their wealth of experience from using a mobile telephone symptom assessment method, the authors identified that at least four symptoms could be mapped accurately using this model. The literature on cancer predictive risk models is ample with such events, and the authors should consider these points in the future development of this tool. Furthermore, what happens if the patients expect a symptom and mentally plan for it, but they do not actually develop it, do they become frustrated or do they exhibit any other emotional reactions? Would this model be acceptable and applicable to other-than-breast cancer patients? Furthermore, although this is a pilot study, the small number of patients used in the study makes generalizations difficult, and it should be further tested with a much larger sample.

Abstract = {Background: Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method: The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the "decision curve." The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion: Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.

Abstract = {The CHRM2 gene is thought to be involved in neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and feedback regulation of acetylcholine release and has previously been implicated in higher cognitive processing. In a sample of 667 individuals from 304 families, we genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRM2 gene on 7q31-35. From all individuals, standardized intelligence measures were available. Using a test of within-family association, which controls for the possible effects of population stratification, a highly significant association was found between the CHRM2 gene and intelligence. The strongest association was between rs324650 and performance IQ (PIQ), where the T allele was associated with an increase of 4.6 PIQ points. In parallel with a large family-based association, we observed an attenuated -- although still significant -- population-based association, illustrating that population stratification may decrease our chances of detecting allele-trait associations. Such a mechanism has been predicted earlier, and this article is one of the first to empirically show that family-based association methods are not only needed to guard against false positives, but are also invaluable in guarding against false negatives.

Abstract = {Aims: This study aims to investigate the relationship between ethanol daily intake (EDI) and the levels of ethyl glucuronide in hair. Design: Ethyl glucuronide concentration was determined in hair samples from different classes of ethanol drinkers and results were compared with the reported information about drinking habits. Setting: Pavia, Italy. Participants: Twenty-two known alcoholics, 21 volunteers self-reporting an EDI from 2 to 60 g, and seven teetotallers were involved in this study. Measurements: Ethyl glucuronide determination in hair samples was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (limit of detection: 2 pg/mg, lower limit of quantification: 3 pg/mg). Findings: Current known alcoholics (n = 21) had ethyl glucuronide hair concentration in the range 4.0-434.7 pg/mg (average: 62.8, median 37.4 pg/mg); ethyl glucuronide was not detected in hair samples from teetotallers (n = 7); all volunteers reporting an EDI of at least 30 g ('non-moderate drinkers' according to the US Department of Health and Human Services) tested positive for ethyl glucuronide (cut-off: 4 pg/mg). All volunteers declaring an ethanol daily intake higher than 40 g ('heavy drinkers' according to the World Health Organization, Regional Committee for Europe) tested positive for this compound (cut-off: 5 pg/mg). The application of a cut-off of either 4 pg/mg or 5 pg/mg resulted in one false positive, coming from a volunteer asserting an ethanol daily intake of 30 g. No false negatives were found. Conclusions: The concentration of ethyl glucuronide in hair appears to correlate with EDI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: The goal of this investigation was to pilot the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) among individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their caregivers, assessing its screen-metric approach. Design and Participants: Using the NPI, caregivers rated neurobehavioral disturbances in 51 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI. The NPI was completed 1 or 2 years after the individuals were injured. Results: Caregivers reported the highest symptom levels for participants on Irritability/Lability, Apathy, and Agitation/Aggression, and rated greater levels of distress tied to those domains and to Dysphoria. Caregivers endorsing domain screening items endorsed significantly more metric items (vs. screen non-endorsers) within that domain, as would be expected if the screen accurately measured the psychopathology under consideration. In addition, the screen-metric yielded extremely low false-positive rates, although 5 of the 12 domains had elevated false-negative rates. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary support for the accuracy of the NPI's screen-metric in this population and are consistent with prior work detailing common problematic neurobehavioral consequences of TBI. These results lay groundwork for research and clinical use of this measure in populations with TBI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The basis of most twin studies is the ascertainment of twins, often through twin registries, and determination of zygosity. The current rate of twin births in many industrialized countries implies that in the near future around 3% or more of individuals will be a twin. Hence, there are and will be a lot of twins around and many of those will not participate in twin studies. However, if large population-based samples are available that include appropriate identifiers, then twins can be detected and twin studies performed, even in the absence of zygosity information. We quantified the number of twin pairs that could be detected from a longitudinal survey in the Netherlands, which aims to answer questions about educational strategies and performance in primary education in the Netherlands. We detected 2865 twin pairs if we used a coded name identifier, date of birth, school, grade and year of survey, which is 2.01% of 284,945 pupils in five cohorts. Relaxing our selection criteria increased the number of apparent twin pairs identified, most of which are false positives due to chance matching of identification criteria. We show that the intraclass correlation on measured phenotypes can be used as a quality control measure for twin identification, and quantify the proportion of false negatives (true twin pairs not identified) due to missing data and data coding errors. We compared our estimated rate of twins in the sample to census data and estimate that with our most stringent selection criteria we detect more than 80% of all twin pairs in the sample. We conclude that the identification of twin pairs from large population-based samples is feasible, rapid and accurate if the appropriate identifiers are available, and that twin pairs from such sources are a valuable resource for studies to answer scientific question about twins versus nontwins and about genetic and environmental factors of twin resemblance.

Abstract = {Implementation of colorectal cancer (CRC) mass screening is a public health priority. Obtaining the involvement of general practitioners (GPs) is crucial for ensuring participation by the general public. This study elicited GPs' reasons for promoting CRC screening. The method used was discrete choice modeling. Questionnaires with a set of pairs of hypothetical screening scenarios were sent to 700 GPs. Factors influencing GPs' screening practice were found to be: the effectiveness of the screening program, the proportion of false negatives and false positives, and their remuneration. Hence improving screening test sensitivity and setting up specific remuneration for conducting screening would help to increase GPs' participation in CRC screening in France.

Abstract = {This paper examines 10 sources of uncertainty in any risk-management system and illustrates them in security measures against terrorism, first, any risk assessment is an uncertain knowledge claim about contingent future events that cannot be fully known. Second, only some risks can be selected for attention, and those left unattended are sources of uncertainty. Third, specific decisions in risk management bear the uncertainty of false positives and false negatives, fourth, risk-management technologies manufacture new uncertainties, some of which pose risks greater than those they were designed to control, fifth, risk is reactive: as people act on knowledge of risk, they simultaneously change the risk environment and create new uncertainties. Sixth, the complexity of risk-management systems can result in multiple and unexpected failures occurring simultaneously; such "normal accidents" are a source of uncertainty beyond any direct human capacity for control. Seventh, catastrophic failures result in the urge to risk manage everything: intensified surveillance, audit, and regulation increase system complexity and yield more uncertainty. Eighth, risk managers facing an increasingly litigious environment for failures become defensive, focusing more on operational risks that might affect the reputation of their organization than on the real risks they are supposed to manage. Ninth, excessive precaution escalates uncertainty and breeds fear, leading to risk-management measures that are at best misplaced and at worst incubate new risks with catastrophic potential. Tenth, risk-management systems can restrict freedom, invade privacy, discriminate, and exclude populations. Such self-defeating costs and the uncertainties they entail can be minimized only by infusing risk-management systems with value questions about human rights, well-being, prosperity, and solidarity.

Abstract = {Purpose: Birth and fetal death certificates classify individuals as twins or higher order multiples, but do not identify multiple gestation groups. As a result, multiple gestations are consistently excluded from maternal and child health research studies despite the surge in multiple births since the early 1980s and the health risks associated with them. A standardized methodology for states to identify multiple gestation groups is proposed to allow researchers to account for multiple gestations in analyses, improve the accuracy of the incidence of multiple gestations and further knowledge of the impact of multiple gestations on birth outcomes. Methods: Using 3 years of Massachusetts birth and fetal death certificate data from 1998 to 2000 (247,959 births and 1358 fetal deaths), we assigned matching multiple gestation group numbers to records with identical combinations of mother's first name, last name, date of birth, and month of delivery. To validate our methodology, we calculated plurality and compared it to plurality reported on the existing birth and fetal death data. Results: This method correctly identified 10,765 records out of 10,795 validated multiple gestation deliveries (99.8%). Our method identified 71 additional multiple gestation deliveries, which were not identified by the birth and fetal death files. This method resulted in only 4 false positives and 51 false negatives over 3 years. Conclusions: This algorithm provides much needed information on multiple gestation groupings, and as an additional benefit, improves the identification of multiple gestation deliveries. This method has proven easy to use, employs state-level data, and offers numerous new analytic opportunities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Polygraph is used increasingly in the treatment and supervision of sex offenders, but little research has addressed its accuracy in this setting, or linked accuracy with utility. Aims: To investigate the utility and accuracy of polygraphy in post-conviction testing of community-based sex offenders. Method: A self-report measure examined the experiences of offenders with polygraphy. Results: Based on self-report, the polygraphs accuracy was approximately 85%. False negatives and false positives were not associated with demographic characteristics, personality variables or IQ. The majority of offenders found the polygraph to be helpful in both treatment and supervision. Nine per cent of offenders claimed to have made false disclosures; these individuals had higher scores on ratings of neuroticism and lower scores on ratings of conscientiousness. Conclusions: These results support the view that the polygraph is both accurate and useful in the treatment and supervision of sex offenders.

Abstract = {When policy-makers use a test result with a cut-off score in a decision, the cut-off threshold may change over time. An example is the threshold of "reasonable suspicion" used to justify a police search. Hammond (1996) postulated that a decision threshold will oscillate over time in response to competing pressures from affected constituencies, as unavoidable cases of false positives (e.g., innocent people searched) and false negatives (e.g., guilty people overlooked) emerge from the uncertainty of using an imperfect test (e.g., level of evidence) to predict the actual measure of interest (e.g., guilt). The structural underpinnings of a cycling threshold are analyzed in this theory-building article. First, we present a simplified converging model of Hammond's initial insight. Then, we present three alternative models: a model with delays in policy-maker responsiveness; one with stakeholders' shifting constituencies in response to recent errors; and one with integral control representing the historical dissatisfaction of competing constituencies. The "history" model meets the theoretical requirements set out by Hammond and fits historical data regarding FBI denials of access to information regarding a third party due to privacy concerns.

Abstract = {Comments on the articles by G. S. Sachs et al. (see record [rid]2007-12420-003[/rid]), (see record [rid]2007-12420-004[/rid]) and (see record [rid]2007-12420-005[/rid]). The widely discussed study by Sachs et al., namely the Effectiveness of adjunctive antidepressant treatment for bipolar depression is based on a pragmatic trial that randomly assigned bipolar depression patients to receive mood stabilizer plus placebo or mood stabilizer plus antidepressant. It achieved similar results in terms of durable recovery and other secondary outcomes. Considering that the aforementioned study employed a new methodological approach, I believe that it would be worthwhile exploring its advantages and disadvantages so as to be better positioned to interpret current studies, as well as to design new ones. Based on the aspects listed below, I would like to discuss whether or not the study contains a "ceiling effect" i.e., a false negative finding resulting from performance and selection biases. In the study by Sachs et al., 60% of the patients presented more than 10 previous manic and depressive episodes, thus suggesting that this group may constitute a refractory sample. The primary outcome of the Sachs et al. study was "durable recovery", defined as eight consecutive weeks of euthymia, with no more than two manic or depression symptoms. In the Sachs et al. study, patients were allowed to increase the dose of the mood stabilizer and enhance the use of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, etc. Such factors could have increased the trial "noise" by increasing non-specific effects at the expense of decreasing the "signal" of the experimental treatment. Sachs et al. compared mood stabilizer + placebo against mood stabilizer + antidepressant drug. In such type of design, ceiling effects are important since the effect of the combined intervention is weaker compared to the effect of each intervention tested separately. To assess an antidepressant's efficacy, which was probably lower in the Sachs et al. study, the study's design should have included a pure placebo arm. In conclusion, given that the number of pragmatic trials in Psychiatry has increased over time, we are now allowed to test the effectiveness of interventions in the "real world". As exemplified by the Sachs et al. study, such trials, however, have certain design characteristics that can lead to ceiling effects. Therefore, when translating results into clinical practice, clinicians should be aware of the possible caveats to be found in pragmatic studies.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to confirm this finding in a larger European sample of alcohol-dependent patients. We included 158 patients of the Franconian Alcoholism Research Studies and 81 patients of the Neuroendocrinology and Neurogenetics in Alcoholism study. All patients fulfilled the criteria of alcohol dependence according to International Classification of Diseases-10 and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV. Data such as age (mean age: 44.1; standard deviation: 8.7) and detailed medical history were obtained in a structured interview. The region covering the BDNF Val66Met SNP was amplified by a standard PCR protocol using genomic DNA as template and subsequent single nucleotide primer extension of the amplicon. We found no deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in both the groups. Our findings do not support the association between the frequency of the Met allele and alcohol dependence reported earlier. Our study was sufficiently powered, making type-II error unlikely (false-negative result). This may be explained by different ethnic ancestry, age, or the very small sample size in the Korean group. In conclusion, we cannot confirm the reported association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and alcohol dependence and craving in alcohol-dependent patients.

Because this was a retrospective study, the decision regarding which segments of the CNS were imaged was made by the managing physicians and not necessarily fully documented in the medical record. The criterion for calling MRI findings positive for LM was the attending neuroradiologist's report at the time the MRI was read. We respectfully disagree with Dr. Chamberlain’s statement that our data indicate that CSF cytology remains superior to MRI for diagnosis of LM. Although true sensitivities and specificities could not be calculated from our data, the rate of false-negative studies of both types indicates that neither modality is clearly superior for diagnosing this challenging entity. Rather, our data reinforce that clinicians must maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for LM and may need to utilize multiple diagnostic modalities in order to secure a diagnosis.

Abstract = {Study Objectives: The study presents an automatic method for scoring leg movements in polysomnographic recordings and describes an empirical investigation of its validity. Design: Leg movements measured by means of the surface electromyogram activation of the right and left tibialis anterior muscle contained in 24 digitally recorded all-night polysomnograms were analyzed visually according to the American Sleep Disorders Association guidelines by 2 experienced raters and automatically scored using a newly developed electromyogram-based analytical method. Two visual scorings and the automatic scoring were compared in pairs using descriptive and confirmative statistical methods. Setting: N/A. Participants: All-night polysomnograms of adaptation nights at the sleep laboratory of 10 patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) according to the International RLS Study Group. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Agreement rates between the 2 well-trained scorers and the automatic method were comparable. Based on the first scorer's results (100%) 92.5% of the movements were detected by the second scorer and 94.3% by the automatic method. When the visual scorings were compared, the rate of false-positive and false-negative errors were 7% and 3%, respectively. Comparing both visual scorings with the results of the automatic scoring yielded false-positive and false-negative rates in the range from 3% to 8%. Conclusions: The degree of accordance between the 2 visual scorings and between the visual and the automatic scorings were comparable. Therefore, this method is valid and may be used for the automatic detection of leg movements in future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Evaluated the screening utility of a teacher-rating instrument (TOCA-R) of aggressive behavior during elementary school years in identifying boys at risk for later violence. A community epidemiological sample of 415 public school boys was rated at 6 time points during elementary school regarding their level of aggressive/disruptive behavior. Violence was measured using juvenile police and court records. Results show that the risk for later violence varied as a function of the boys' level of aggressive behavior. This relationship peaked in 3rd grade, where more aggressive boys compared to less aggressive boys were twice as likely to commit later violent acts. In respect to identifying at-risk boys, 3 intervention scenarios were compared. When minimizing false positives, the optimal test was found in the fall of 1st grade, with 83% of the high-risk compared to 22% of the low-risk boys later having a violent arrest record. When minimizing false negatives, the optimal test was found in the spring of 4th grade (30% of the high-risk boys vs 0% of the low-risk boys). Focusing on both false positives and false negatives, the optimal test was found in the spring of 3rd grade (52% of the high-risk boys vs 14% of the low-risk boys).

First, the results obtained from the analysis of pH samples could be affected because of the use of medications that modify gastric acidity and therefore could reveal false-negative results. It is rare that there is no significant difference between pH results in patients receiving H2 blockers and patients not receiving them. Furthermore, various kinds of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can have varying effects on the gastric pH in critically ill patients. It is important that practitioners recognize that mechanical ventilation can cause additional feeding tube displacement issues. Patients maintained on mechanical ventilation usually have a prolonged length of stay, inadequate feeding delivery and are at higher risk of pulmonary complications than other patients.

Abstract = {Inaccuracy in self-reports of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening procedures may interfere with individuals adhering to appropriate screening intervals, and can blur the true effects of physician recommendations to screen and the effects of interventions designed to promote screening. We assessed accuracy of self-report of having a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within a 1-year window based on receipt of FOBT kits among individuals aged 50 and older in the carpentry trade (N = 658) who were off-schedule for having had a FOBT. Indices of evaluating accuracy of self-reports (concordance, specificity, false-positive and false-negative rates) were calculated relative to receipt of a mailed FOBT. Among those who mailed a completed FOBT, we assessed accuracy of reporting the test result. Participants underestimated having performed a FOBT (false-negative rate of 44%). Accuracy was unrelated to perceptions of getting or worrying about CRC or family history. Self-reports of having a negative FOBT result more consistently matched the laboratory result (specificity 98%) than having a positive test result. Contrary to other findings, participants under- rather than overreported FOBT screening. Results suggest greater efforts are needed to enhance accurate recall of FOBT screening.

Abstract = {Connectionist computer simulation was employed to explore the notion that, if attitudes guide approach and avoidance behaviors, false negative beliefs are likely to remain uncorrected for longer than false positive beliefs. In Study 1, the authors trained a three-layer neural network to discriminate "good" and "bad" inputs distributed across a two-dimensional space. "Full feedback" training, whereby connection weights were modified to reduce error after every trial, resulted in perfect discrimination. "Contingent feedback," whereby connection weights were only updated following outputs representing approach behavior, led to several false negative errors (good inputs misclassified as bad). In Study 2, the network was redesigned to distinguish a system for learning evaluations from a mechanism for selecting actions. Biasing action selection toward approach eliminated the asymmetry between learning of good and bad inputs under contingent feedback. Implications for various attitudinal phenomena and biases in social cognition are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Although distortion is commonly present in memory, the relation between the emotionality of a witnessed scene and susceptibility to mistaken memories is controversial. Participants (N = 90; aged 17-43 years) were recruited for research focusing on "emotional processing" and were not informed that their memories were being investigated. Then, they viewed either a highly positive, neutral, or highly negative emotional scene (e.g., graphic fatal accident) from the International Affective Picture System (e.g., Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1999). Half of participants were exposed to misleading questions--one of which included a major false suggestion (i.e., large animal in the scene). An hour later all participants were asked to recall the scene and asked 10 direct questions, five of which related to the misinformation provided earlier. Overall, misleading questions impaired recall accuracy by 37%. Further, negative emotion increased susceptibility to false memories for the major misinformation. Whereas 0% of nonmisled participants in any condition recalled seeing the major false detail, misled participants in the negative condition recalled seeing the major false detail more often (80%) than those in the positive (40%) and neutral (40%) conditions.

Abstract = {Identified appropriate Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) cut-offs for Japanese older adults. The GDS and the CSDD were interview-administered to nondepressed (n=74) and depressed (n=37) Japanese older adults. Depressed subjects were also administered the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Data were also collected on demographic variables, mental status, health status, and medication use. ROC curve analysis identified a cut-off score of 6 for the GDS which had a sensitivity of 0.973, a specificity of 0.959, a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.894, and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0. A cutoff score of 5 for the CSDD yielded a sensitivity of 1, a specificity of 0.919, a FPR of 0.942, and a FNR of 0. Comparisons indicate current HDRS cut-offs may overlook subthreshold depression. The GDS cut-off score identified among Japanese subjects was the same as that reported for Western subjects. Due to the substantial prevalence of psychiatric disorders found in false-negative subjects, the above cut-off scores were chosen to optimize the potential for true positives. These scores are recommended for alerting physicians and other caregivers as to when more intensive depression evaluation is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Achenbach, 1991) items, reflecting symptoms of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defined disruptive disorders, alone and in combination with other child and familial risk factors, were used to predict children's risk for disruptive disorder. Predictive accuracy reached a positive predictive value of 69%. Children incorrectly classified (false positive and false negative) were compared with correctly classified children (true positive and true negative) on risk factors in the family context to test whether the screening procedure could be improved through a multiple-gating procedure. The differences in familial context factors between these children were limited, and no clear indications were found on how to use familial context factors to improve the screening procedure after the initial classification by LCA.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Beverley Chalmers (see record [rid]2011-27688-001[/rid]). The editorial by Chalmers implies that it is a Canadian standard in the midwifery profession for regulatory bodies to support their members in terminating the care of clients who do not follow the midwife’s clinical recommendations. This is not the case to suggest it is paints a false and negative picture of regulated midwifery across the country. Chalmers’s editorial discusses a case described in a previous article by Andrew Kotaska wherein a British Columbia midwife, with the support of her College, terminated the care of a woman who refused to follow her recommendation to undergo a cesarean section for a breech baby. The comments by Chalmers are problematic because they assume that all Canadian midwifery regulators would have managed the situation the same way, which is inaccurate. Other provinces and territories have similar processes for managing cases where the client’s informed choice does not follow the recommendation of the midwife. Abandoning the care of a client is not standard practice anywhere in Canadian midwifery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the physical, parental, and psychological correlates of subtypes of high Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) scores and bulimia nervosa (BN) in 155 girls/young women (grade 7th-10th) seen at two times over a 6-year period (mean ages 14, 16, and 22). In young adulthood, participants were interviewed for lifetime history for an eating disorder; participants completed questions assessing subclinical problems and correlates at both times of assessment. Based on their EAT-26 scores and diagnostic status for BN at each time, girls were classified into the following groups: True Positive, False Positive, and True Negative. In adolescence, 4% of girls were classified as True Positives and 23% were classified as False Positives. Similar distributions were found at young adulthood. By using cluster analysis, two types of subclinical problems were identified at each time with some girls having only high eating symptoms and others also having high psychopathology. The 'high eating symptoms only' cluster was more similar to the True Negative group than was the 'high Psychopathology' cluster at each time. Individuals in the latter group experienced co-occurrence with depression, resulting in pervasive impairments in psychosocial functioning during both adolescence and young adulthood.

Abstract = {According to error management theory, natural selection will often produce adaptively biased systems of judgement, even when these systems produce more errors than alternative designs. In a study of naturally occurring events, evidence of one such bias in men--the sexual overperception bias--was documented. 102 women and 114 men (mean age 19 yrs) reported past experiences in which a member of the opposite sex erroneously inferred their sexual interest. Women reported significantly more false-positive errors committed by men than false-negative errors. Men reported roughly equal numbers of false-positive and false-negative errors committed by women, suggesting no bias in women's sexual inferences. Several within-sex predictors of misperceptions were identified; for example, individuals high in self-perceived mate value reported more false-positive inferences by others than did individuals lower in mate value.

Abstract = {Tests can be used either diagnostically (i.e., to confirm or rule out the presence of a condition in people suspected of having it) or as a screening instrument (determining who in a large group of people has the condition and often when those people are unaware of it or unwilling to admit to it). Tests that may be useful and accurate for diagnosis may actually do more harm than good when used as a screening instrument. The reason is that the proportion of false negatives may be high when the prevalence is high, and the proportion of false positives tends to be high when the prevalence of the condition is low (the usual situation with screening tests). My first aim of this article is to discuss the effects of the base rate, or prevalence, of a disorder on the accuracy of test results. My second aim is to review some of the many diagnostic efficiency statistics that can be derived from a 2 x 2 table, including the overall correct classification rate, kappa, phi, the odds ratio, positive and negative predictive power and some variants of them, and likelihood ratios.

Abstract = {Disorders of visual perception can range from the ‘positive’ (hallucinations) to the ‘negative’ (visual agnosia in which a ‘visual percept is stripped of its meaning’). Understanding the broad sweep of these disorders has been advanced by functional neuroimaging and the concept of a ‘hodotopic framework’ comprising specialised cortical subregions (topology) and their connections (hodology). The present author comments on an article by Dominic H. Ffytche, J. D. Blom and M. Catani (see record [rid]2010-25137-022[/rid]) that harnesses the hodotopic framework to concepts of CNS hyper-and hypofunction to create a new taxonomy of abnormal visual perception. Mendeleev's initial table of the elements had empty spaces, and so too Ffytche concedes that the proposed schema 'predicts a number of theoretical disorders which are as yet undescribed.' The hodotopic framework is built upon the foundations of fMRI and DT (diffusion tensor) dMRI tractography. The authors invoke their wide experience with both imaging techniques, and account for some abnormal visual percepts with an ‘increase in (fMRI?) activity’ in specialised areas of cortex while cautioning the reader that the meaning of increased activity is ‘unclear.in neurophysiological terms.’ This lack of clarity arises because ‘the fMRI signal cannot easily differentiate between function-specific processing and neuromodulation, between bottom-up and top-down signals and it may potentially confuse excitation and inhibition.’3 DT-MRI has its own ‘pitfalls and shortcomings... in regions where fibres cross, kiss, splay, branch, or twist’ leading to artefactual reconstructions and false negatives of neural pathways. If present limitations of functional neuroimaging can be overcome, the signal characteristics of typical 55 mm³ fMRI voxels will make further inroads on the 'easy problem' of mapping the circuitry of visual perception but not the 'hard problem' of neural correlate of consciousness (NCC) which questions how subjective experience arises from physical processes. The prescient voids in Mendeleev's periodic table were vindicated by the later discovery of elemental gallium and germanium, the new categorization challenges the clinician to approach novel and unexplained visual symptoms as possible ‘missing elements' in Ffytche's table.

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of a model proposed by Batıgün and Şahin regarding suicide probability. Method: The sample was composed of 2343 students aged 15-25 years that were attending various high schools and universities. According to the proposed model, 2 risk groups were formed from this sample, according to their scores on the investigation variables (those that simultaneously received high scores 1 standard deviation above the mean on the Problem Solving Inventory, Multidimensional Anger Scale, and Impulsivity Scale). Two other risk groups were formed according to the criteria variable scores (suicide probability scores 1 standard deviation above and below the mean). A series of analyses were conducted to investigate the similarity between the model risk groups and criteria risk groups. Results: The results reveal that the model had a 43.3% success rate for predicting those with high suicide probability, while the false negative rate was 0%. Discriminant analysis showed that the model correctly discriminated 90.2% of those with low suicide probability and 87.3% of those with high suicide probability. Conclusion: The results support the validity of the proposed model for selecting individuals with high suicide probability. In addition, the model can be used to offer these individuals certain preventive measures, such as problem solving, communication skills, and anger management training.

Abstract = {Objective: Hearing preservation is the main focus of small acoustic neurinoma (AN) removal. Refinement of intraoperative auditory monitoring may improve post-operative hearing. We have introduced a newly designed intracranial electrode enabling continuous monitoring of the cochlear nerve compound action potential (CNAP). We performed simultaneous monitoring of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and CNAP during retrosigmoid small AN removal, and clarified the surgical outcome and the usefulness of CNAP monitoring. Methods: Twenty-two consecutive patients with a small AN underwent retrosigmoid tumour removal with attempting hearing preservation. ABR and CNAP were simultaneously monitored during tumour removal. Results: AN was totally removed in all patients without facial palsy. Preservation rate of useful and serviceable hearing was 82% and 91%, respectively. During microsurgical tumour removal, various surgical equipments and procedures intensified artefacts of ABR, and reliable ABR monitoring with distinct wave V was obtained in 9/22 patients. Unaffected by artefacts, reliable CNAP monitoring was obtained more frequently (in 20/22 patients) than ABR (p=0.0005). CNAP on completion of tumour removal predicted hearing preservation with no false positive or negative (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). CNAP changed dynamically and stepwise with surgical manipulations. Conclusion: The retrosigmoid approach using auditory monitoring for a small AN can accomplish total tumour removal with an excellent hearing preservation rate. CNAP provides reliable auditory monitoring more frequently than ABR, reflects the intraoperative auditory function almost in real-time, predicts postoperative hearing with excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is more useful for monitoring in the removal of small AN with hearing preservation.

Abstract = {There is great interest in using automatic computational neuroanatomy tools to study ageing and neurodegenerative disease. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is one of the most widely used of such techniques. VBM performs voxel-wise statistical analysis of smoothed spatially normalised segmented Magnetic Resonance Images. There are several reasons why the analysis should include only voxels within a certain mask. We show that one of the most commonly used strategies for defining this mask runs a major risk of excluding from the analysis precisely those voxels where the subjects' brains were most vulnerable to atrophy. We investigate the issues related to mask construction, and recommend the use of alternative strategies which greatly decrease this danger of false negatives.

Abstract = {Introduction: Work-related asthma has become the most prevalent occupational respiratory disease in the developed world. Occupational asthma is thought to affect 5%-10% of people worldwide. The first step in the diagnosis of occupational asthma is to establish work-relatedness. Although considerable research has been conducted in the area of occupational asthma, no simple, effective, and statistically sound method has been developed that can be used as an initial step to effectively identify the workers at risk for occupational asthma. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether Shewhart control chart method can be used as an effective method to detect occupational asthma. Method: Forty-five workers who completed the study and provided usable peak expiratory flow (a lung function marker) recordings while at work and away from work were included in this study. Control charts were developed using Shewhart's Method. The lower control limit of at work control chart (LCLW) was compared to each subject's Personal Best (PB) value. Results: Reviewing the results of this comparison showed LCLW<60% PB to have a sensitivity of 85.71%, specificity of 87.50%, and an error rate of 13.33%. When the subjects suspected for false positive and false negative diagnoses were identified, the test produced a sensitivity of 95.24%, a specificity of 95.83% and an error rate of 4.44%. Conclusions: Our results were as good as, and in some cases better than, published clinical guidelines. Impact on Industry: Our research showed that the control chart method is an effective, simple, and inexpensive tool for early intervention in workers suspected for occupational asthma.

Abstract = {Human cognition is often biased, from judgments of the time of impact of approaching objects all the way through to estimations of social outcomes in the future. We propose these effects and a host of others may all be understood from an evolutionary psychological perspective. In this article, we elaborate error management theory (EMT; Haselton & Buss, 2000). EMT predicts that if judgments are made under uncertainty, and the costs of false positive and false negative errors have been asymmetric over evolutionary history, selection should have favored a bias toward making the least costly error. This perspective integrates a diverse array of effects under a single explanatory umbrella, and it yields new content-specific predictions.

The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which K-5th graders who met the borderline and clinical cut-off scores on the Teacher Report Form (T. M. Achenbach, 1991) received one or more office discipline referrals (the most liberal criteria possible) to determine the levels of false negatives (failure to detect a problem when one exists) that would occur if one used office discipline referrals as an early screening device. The relatively high levels of false negatives suggest that the use of office discipline referrals as an early screening device may fail to identify relatively large numbers of young children in need of interventions and supports. This issue appears to be even more pronounced in the case of students who are experiencing internalizing-related problems. Results, limitations, and future research needs are discussed.

Abstract = {Examiners disagree on whether or not multiple choice and true/false tests should be negatively marked. Much of the debate has been clouded by neglect of the role of misinformation and by vagueness regarding both the specification of test types and 'partial knowledge' in relation to guessing. This paper aims to clarify these points and to compare the ill-effects on test reliability of guessing and of variable risk-taking. Three published studies on medical students are examined. These compare responses in true/false tests obtained with both negative marking and number-right scoring. The studies yield data on misinformation and on the extent to which students may fail to benefit from distrusted partial knowledge when there is negative marking. A simple statistical model is used to compare variations in risk-taking with test unreliability due to blind guessing under number-right scoring conditions. Partial knowledge should be least problematic with independent true/false items. The effect on test reliability of blind guessing under number-right conditions is generally greater than that due to the over-cautiousness of some students when there is negative marking.

Abstract = {Although Unibase cream has been an effective medium for electrodermal recordings, its production has recently been discontinued. This study compared alternative media to Unibase for effectiveness. Three base creams similar to Unibase were initially compared for in vitro viscosity and effectiveness. Based upon this analysis 1 cream was eliminated. A volunteer sample of 6 postmenopausal women (mean age 45.67 yrs) with hot flashes and 6 young women (mean age 22.17 yrs) without flashes was recruited. Media were evaluated for viscosity and effectiveness of skin conductance. Results indicate that 1 electrolyte media produced readings within the normal range, identified true positive hot flashes, and produced few false negative readings whereas the second produced largely unreadable results with many false negative hot flashes. An appropriate substitute for Unibase as an effective electrolyte medium for measurement of electrodermal activity was identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A Swedish version of the Reiss Screen for Maladaptive Behavior (RSMB), an instrument used for identifying mental health problems in people with intellectual disability (ID), was evaluated in terms of inter-rater agreement, internal consistency, item grouping and criterion validity based on a random sample (aged 21-68 yrs) and a clinical group of 21 adults with ID (aged 19-57 yrs). The Swedish version of the RSMB had moderate-to-low inter-rater agreement on specific items and good internal consistency. The total score was considered to be a fairly reliable measure of a positive or negative result on the RSMB. A principal component analysis yielded seven interpretable components. A close resemblance in sets of items between the Swedish version and the original version of RSMB was found for three subscales: Aggressive Behaviour, Avoidance Disorder and Depression (Behavioural Signs). The outcome of the criterion validity analysis indicated a higher rate of false negatives than false positives. The potential influence of concurrent psychopharmacological treatment is discussed. It is concluded that the Swedish version of the RSMB can be used as intended by staff as a primary screening device for the identification of mental health problems among people with ID in a Swedish setting.

Abstract = {Notes that 1 paradigm for false memory research was developed by H. L. Roediger, III and K. B. McDermott (1995), based on earlier research by J. Deese (1959), and is known as the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. In the DRM paradigm, participants are asked to learn lists of words that are all semantically associated with the same critical non-presented word. Each list was composed of 15 list words related to 1 critical non-presented word. The author argues that the experiments revealed remarkable levels of false recall and false recognition in participants tested individually. This article briefly reviews the experiments with manipulations of encoding, materials, participants, and tests, and how they influenced false recall and false recognition in the DRM paradigm. Then 2 types of experiments are introduced, 1 that attempted to determine the effect of negative mood on false memories of negative-toned words, and another that investigated whether collaborative remembering creates false memories relative to individual recollection.

Abstract = {There is ongoing debate about whether randomized, placebo-controlled trials under a double-blind have reliably established the pharmacological efficacy of antidepressants. Numerous meta-analyses of antidepressant efficacy trials, e.g., Kirsch et al. [Kirsch, I., Moore, T. J., Scoboria, A., & Nicholls, S. (2002). The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. food and drug administration. Prevention and Treatment, 5, Article 23. (Retrieved July 19, 2007 from http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume5)], have shown a modest drug-placebo difference but methodological problems with standard trial design preclude a definitive conclusion that this difference results from specific biological effects of antidepressants or the nonspecific factors that have not been adequately excluded. Standard trial design assumes the additivity thesis of pharmacological efficacy, being the assumption that the specific or “true” magnitude of the pharmacological effect is limited to the difference between the drug and placebo responses in a standard trial. If the drug effects are as small as these meta-analyses suggest, then their clinical effectiveness is questionable. If the drug effects are actually larger but masked by placebo effects, then the additivity thesis is not valid and we risk false negative results with standard trial design. Kirsch et al. propose an alternative, four arm balanced placebo trial design (BPTD) that can accurately test the additivity thesis. The BPTD uses antidepressants, active placebos and the intentional deception of research subjects. My focal question is whether the BPTD is ethically defensible. I will explore two objections that can be raised against it: 1) lying to BPTD research subjects violates their autonomy and exploits their illness and 2) the BPTD may not enable us to test the additivity thesis with accuracy, i.e., it may contribute to the masking of drug effects that it aims to avoid. I argue that these objections support the conclusion that the BPTD is ethically indefensible. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Hans-Christoph Diener et al. (see record [rid]2008-17352-014[/rid]). Hans-Christoph Diener et al. investigated the effects of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole versus clopidogrel and telmisartan on disability and cognitive function after recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke in the prevention regimen for effectively avoiding second strokes (PRoFESS) trial. Their results teach us that aspirin and telmisartan are unlikely to have substantial neuroprotective effects; the lack of neuroprotective effects from aspirin has also been reported in other studies. However, these results might be a false-negative. First, the PRoFESS trial was not designed or powered primarily to test the neuroprotection hypothesis. Second, the outcome measures were not direct measures of neuroprotection but were surrogates in the form of physical disability and cognitive impairment. Third, the duration of exposure to the trial drugs (mean 2.5 years) might have been insufficient to enable the potential benefi ts of these interventions to be maximised. The results of a substudy of PRoFESS, which used more sophisticated neuropsychological instruments, will hopefully provide greater insights into this important issue.

Abstract = {Often high profile cases impact the standards for ethical practices in forensic psychology and psychiatry. In Minnesota, a high profile sexual homicide allegedly committed by a parolee who was not civilly committed as mentally ill and dangerous or sexually dangerous (likely due to older age) has brought to question the state's risk assessment policies. Due to the high profile nature of this case, the State Operated Forensic Services (SOFS) in Minnesota has attempted to implement heightened standards in their violence risk assessment policy for both mentally ill and dangerous and sexually violent offender populations. The rationale for this article is to outline how the publicity of a high profile sexual homicide can result in changes in a state's risk assessment procedures. The author will briefly outline the revised risk assessment standards within a state operated civil commitment forensic hospital and describe a case study of a civilly committed sex offender who was examined under these new standards. The author will also question whether more is better. Specifically, the question will be asked whether such standards and practices are efficient and necessary given the issues of incremental validity and the fact that there will always be false negatives (an offender who is deemed to be non-dangerous, who ultimately is).

Abstract = {Subarachnoidal cysticercosis (SAC) is frequently associated with inflammatory CSF, clinical manifestations, and vascular involvement. Our goal was to determine cytokine production in CSF in patients with SAC and their association with cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) before and after cysticidal treatment. We studied 15 women and 16 men. Contrast enhancement along basal cisterns on MRI and CSF pleocytosis were associated with high CBFV. Although the patients within the high-CBFV group gradually reduced MCA flow velocity, high CBFV values persisted at 6 months follow-up. Our study had limitations. 1) No control group was used. 2) Exclusion of ELISA false-negative patients could have biased the series toward more severe disease. 3) All TS were performed by one manipulator. 4) Lower concentrations of IL-1β could be attributed to a poor immunologic induction by the parasite or a different sensitivity of the assay.

Abstract = {The study examined the properties of the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT) for children under 24 months. The STAT provides a standard context for observing social-communicative behavior in play, imitation, and communication. Seventy-one children received the STAT between 12 and 23 months of age and a follow-up diagnostic evaluation after 24 months. All had an older sibling with an autism spectrum diagnosis (n = 59) or had been referred for evaluation for concerns about autism (n = 12). Signal detection analysis resulted in a cut score of 2.75 for this sample, which yielded a sensitivity of 0.95, specificity of 0.73, positive predictive value of 0.56, and negative predictive value of 0.97. False positives were highest for the 12- to 13-month-old age group; STAT screening properties were improved when the sample was limited to children 14 months and older. Implications for using the STAT with children under 24 months are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: Motor conduction velocity may yield false-negative results in mild ulnar nerve entrapment at elbow (UNE). There is evidence that the clinical heterogeneity of UNE may be due to the different involvement of fascicles. We hypothesized that, if fibres to FDI are more damaged than fibres to ADM, a relative slowing of motor conduction velocity (CV) at the segment across the elbow recording from FDI (FDI-CV) versus CV at the same segment recording from ADM (ADM-CV) would occur. Methods: We calculated the ratio between FDI-CV and ADM-CV (IN-RATIO) in 60 consecutive UNE patients, 40 norms, and 16 patients with lower cervical radiculopathy. The UNE sample consisted of (1) patients with neurophysiological evidence (UNE NF+), (2) patients without neurophysiological evidence (UNE NF-). We evaluated the possible usefulness of the IN-RATIO to increase sensitivity in diagnosing UNE. Results: The IN-RATIO was lower in the UNE NF- than in norms (p < 0.001) and cervicobrachialgia sample (p = 0.02). We found that if the IN-RATIO is ≤ 0.97, its sensitivity in diagnosing UNE NF- is 68%, specificity 91%. Conclusions: Fibres to FDI have a higher susceptibility to damage than fibres to ADM, and the IN-RATIO is a useful neurophysiological parameter to increase diagnostic sensitivity. Significance: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of a new neurophysiological parameter in improving diagnosis of UNE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Psychoanalysis as a treatment originated in the idea that neurosis is related to the ways in which individual psychic reality departs from actuality. Psychic reality includes memories, beliefs and their associated affects and fantasies connected with an individual's experience of the inner and outer world. The psychoanalytic determination of what meaningful memories or beliefs are inaccurate, distorted or false ordinarily relies upon principles of intra-clinical validation. By itself, however, intra-clinical validation is subject to limitations and pitfalls that conviction alone about what is actual cannot circumvent. Despite this fact, there are remarkably few analytic case reports demonstrating false or significantly distorted memories through the use of data obtained from outside the consulting room. This paucity of reports may be related, at least in part, to the belief that the use of extra-clinical data is essentially unanalytic or supports resistance. Based on the views that (a) psychic reality cannot be regarded as exclusively subjective or objective but is inherently both; and that (b) a goal of analysis is to achieve a different, acceptable and more accurate view of reality, the authors report a clinical case involving a confirmably false pivotal memory and its associated negative affects. They discuss theoretical and technical considerations in utilizing extra-clinical data during the treatment process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: In neurological practice patients with tentative idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) usually are referred to neurosurgery based on clinical and radiological findings. Hydrodynamic assessment using lumbar infusion testing might be helpful in selecting patients. To retrospectively analyse lumbar infusion tests done in neurological practice in iNPH patients to see how infusion test results relate to the clinical course and shunt response. Materials and methods: Sixty-three consecutive patients with Possible/Probable iNPH were tested during a 1-year period. The pre-operative lumbar infusion tests were assessed according to two strategies: (i) Determining the resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow (Rout). (ii) Quantification of the CSF pressure (CSFP) pulsatility during lumbar infusion (Qpulse). The results were related to the prospectively followed clinical course and shunt response after 12 months. Results: The lumbar infusion-derived parameters Rout and Qpulse related weakly. Shunt response after 12 months was not related to Rout, but was highly related to the Qpulse. False negative results of lumbar infusion testing were observed in 16% of the patients. Discussion: In neurological practice lumbar infusion testing may be useful for determining which patients to refer to neurosurgery. Our data favour determination of CSFP pulsatility (Qpulse) rather than Rout for prediction of shunt response. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Reviews the test, Koppitz developmental scoring system for the Bender Gestalt Test (KOPPITZ-2) by C. R. Reynolds (2007). The KOPPITZ-2 is a revision and redevelopment of the original Koppitz Bender Gestalt Test for Young Children (Koppitz, 1963, 1975). It consists of 16 design cards of the Bender Gestalt II and is used to assess visual-motor integration skills in examinees ages 5 to 85 and beyond. The scoring system supplements second edition of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, which included 3 more complex drawings, beyond the original 13, appropriate for adult assessment. Cards 1 through 13 are given to children ages 5 through 7. Cards 5 through 16 are administered to examinees ages 8 and older. The test purports to measure visual-perceptual skills and fine motor coordination as an integrated gestalt based on Koppitz's (1975) conceptualization. The strength of the KOPPITZ-2 scoring system is that it is theoretically sound and has the benefit of a large body of historical research from the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test. It is relatively easy to score and has adequate guidelines for determining a normal versus impaired drawing. The test leaves room for subjective evaluations by the examiner, so individual interpretations can be incorporated and compared to more objective analyses. The strengths of the KOPPITZ-2 also reflect its limitations. Although the scoring system is simple and straightforward, it may be overly simplistic and lead to false negatives.

Abstract = {There is an increased prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in women with migraine with aura (MwA) compared to controls, but the role of PFO in triggering aura is still debated. The aim of this study was to test a group of women suffering from MwA with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), to assess the NIRS capability of discriminating between subjects with and without PFO. Eighty-eight MwA patients (mean age 37.4 ± 10.7 years, range 16-62 years) underwent NIRS measurement of the cerebral variations of the oxygenated (O₂Hb) and reduced haemoglobin (HHb) during breath-holding. The prevalence of O₂Hb vs. HHb was used to assess the presence of PFO. As a gold standard, the presence of PFO was assessed by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). At the TCD analysis 48 patients (55%) showed PFOs, 32 of which were permanent. NIRS correctly detected 36 subjects out of 40 without PFO, and 38 subjects out of 48 having PFO: sensitivity was 79%; specificity was 90%. All the false negatives were permanent shunts. MwA patients with PFO showed a delayed increase in the O₂Hb concentration and a reduced oxygenation with respect to subjects without PFO. NIRS is effective in identifying the presence of PFO in a MwA population, but TCD achieves better diagnostic performances. The NIRS provides additional information about the cerebral vasoreactivity and highlights substantial differences between patients with latent and permanent shunts that warrant further studies.

Abstract = {Before considering a given fMRI paradigm as a valid clinical tool, one should first assess the reliability of functional responses across subjects by establishing a normative database and defining a reference activation map that identifies major brain regions involved in the task at hand. However, the definition of such a reference map can be hindered by inter-individual functional variability. In this study, we analysed functional data obtained from 50 healthy subjects during a semantic language task to assess the influence of the number of subjects on the reference map and to characterise inter-individual functional variability. We first compared different group analysis approaches and showed that the extent of the activated network depends not only on the choice of the analysis approach but also on the statistical threshold used and the number of subjects included. This analysis suggested that, while the RFX analysis is suitable to detect confidently true positive activations, the other group approaches are useful for exploratory investigations in small samples. The application of quantitative measures at the voxel and regional levels suggested that while ∼15-20 subjects were sufficient to reveal reliable and robust left hemisphere activations, >30 subjects were necessary for revealing more variable and weak right hemisphere ones. Finally, to visualise inter-individual variability, we combined two similarity indices that assess the percentages of true positive and false negative voxels in individual activation patterns relative to the group map. We suggest that these measures can be used for the estimation of the degree of 'normality' of functional responses in brain-damaged patients, where this question is often raised, and recommend the use of different quantifications to appreciate accurately the inter-individual functional variability that can be incorporated in group maps.

Abstract = {Studies have reported substantial mnestic deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Most of this research, however, has focussed on errors of omission (poor recall/recognition) rather than commission (such as false recall/recognition). Nevertheless, recent studies report that schizophrenics show increased false recognition and speculate that this may underpin delusional ideation (Moritz et al., 2004). No previous study has examined whether such memory problems exist in normal individuals who may be prone to delusional thinking. Using the Roediger and McDermott (1995) paradigm, we investigated memory functioning in 105 normal healthy subjects divided according to performance on a measure of delusional ideation (Peters et al. Delusional Inventory: PDI Peters et al., 1999). We found significantly poorer recall in the high than low PDI group. Moreover, high PDI scorers also made more false-alarm memory recalls than low PDI scorers. In a recognition test, high and low PDI subjects did not differ in the confidence they attached to recognition of studied items, but high PDI subjects gave greater confidence for falsely accepting unseen items. This suggests that healthy subjects scoring high on a measure of delusional thinking do show an increased tendency to make false positives, but not to make false negative memory judgements.

Abstract = {Background: Aspiration is a common complication in acute stroke patients and is strongly associated with a poor outcome. Due to an insufficient sensitivity and specificity of clinical bedside tests, further refinements are needed to improve the accuracy of clinical aspiration screening in acute stroke. Objective: To assess the ability of the simple 2-step swallowing provocation test (SPT) to detect aspiration risk in acute stroke patients. Methods: 100 consecutive patients with first-ever stroke were examined by SPT and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) within 72 hours of stroke onset. Using FEES as an objective instrumental technique to evaluate dysphagia, statistical measures representing the ability of SPT to detect aspiration risk were calculated. Results: The incidence of endoscopically proven aspiration risk was 81%. The 1st-step SPT had a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 100%. Although the 2nd-step SPT showed the same 100% specificity, sensitivity was significantly lower. False-negative results of SPT appeared predominantly in subjects exhibiting leakage of liquids to pyriform sinus without a pronounced delay in swallow onset. Conclusions: In acute stroke patients with an impairment of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, 1st-step SPT reliably detects aspiration risk. In patients with a sole or predominant impairment of the oral phase of swallowing and a relatively intact pharyngeal phase, SPT fails to detect aspiration risk sufficiently. In the latter group, FEES or additional clinical features more specifically indicating oral-phase pathology should be considered to accurately judge the patient's aspiration risk.

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore how pregnant Japanese women interpret maternal serum screening test results presented as probabilities and to consider the possible methods to improve women's understanding of the results. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 women. Data collection and analysis were performed concurrently, based on the grounded theory approach. We showed that the participants interpreted the test results using various criteria, including information from obstetricians, previously experienced risk probabilities, subjective interpretations, and comparisons with other women. The explanations given by health-care professionals affected the participants' interpretation of the probability of risk and their recognition of false-negative results. Therefore, health-care professionals should explain the meaning of the probability test results and confirm how women interpret them. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To examine facility variation in data quality of the level of pain documented in the minimum data set (MDS) as a function of level of hospice enrollment in nursing homes (NHs). Data Source: Clinical assessments on 3,469 nonhospice residents from 178 NHs were merged with On-line Survey Certification and Reporting data of 2000, Medicare Claims data of 2000 and the MDS of 2000-2002. Study Design: Using the same assessment protocol, NH staff and study nurses independently assessed 3,469 nonhospice residents. Study nurses' assessments being gold standard, we quantified and compared quality of NH staffs pain rating across NHs with high, medium, or low hospice use. Multilevel models were built to assess the effect of NH hospice use levels on the occurrence of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) errors in NH-rated "severe pain." Principal Findings: Of 178 NHs, 25 had medium and 41 high hospice use. NHs with higher hospice use had lower sensitivities. In multilevel analysis, we found a significant facility-level variation in the probability of FP and FN errors in facility-rated "severe pain." Resident characteristics only explained 4 and 0 percent of the facility variation in FP and FN, respectively; characteristics and locations (state) of NHs further explained 53 and 52 percent of the variance. After controlling for resident and NH characteristics, staff in NHs with medium or high hospice use were less likely to have FP or FN errors in their MDS documentation of pain than were staff in NHs with low or no hospice use. Conclusions: The examination of data quality of pooled MDS data from multiple NHs is insufficient. Multilevel analysis is needed to elucidate sources of heterogeneity in the quality of MDS data across NHs. Facility characteristics, e.g., hospice use or NH location, arc systematically associated with overrated/underrated pain and may bias pain quality indicator (QI) comparisons. To ensure the integrity of QI comparison in the NH setting, the government may need to institute regular audits of MDS data quality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Objective: To investigate psychopathology and diagnostic efficiency with MMPI-PK scale for patients with stress disorder (SD). Methods: MMPI-2s were administered to forty-three in patients with SD and forty-four well-adjusted trauma survivors as controls. Results: Patients with SD obtained significantly higher PK scores than controls. Gender, types of traumatic events and types of diagnoses for patients with SD did not substantially influence PK scores. When an optimal cut-off point of 17 was utilized, sensitivity and specificity obtained by PK assessment are respectively 94.9% and 66.7%. Conclusion: Patients with SD and trauma survivors show significantly different psychopathology. PK scale was sensitive to the assessment of posttraumatic stress symptoms though it produced more false-positive than false-negative errors.

Abstract = {The diagnosis of developmental dyslexia (DD) is reliant on a discrepancy between intellectual functioning and reading achievement. Discrepancy-based formulae have frequently been employed to establish the significance of the difference between 'intelligence' and 'actual' reading achievement. These formulae, however, often fail to take into consideration test reliability and the error associated with a single test score. This paper provides an illustration of the potential effects that test reliability and measurement error can have on the diagnosis of dyslexia, with particular reference to discrepancy models. The roles of reliability and standard error of measurement (SEM) in classic test theory are also briefly reviewed. This is followed by illustrations of how SEM and test reliability can aid with the interpretation of a simple discrepancy-based formula of DD. It is proposed that a lack of consideration of test theory in the use of discrepancy-based models of DD can lead to misdiagnosis (both false positives and false negatives). Further, misdiagnosis in research samples affects reproducibility and generalizability of findings. This in turn, may explain current inconsistencies in research on the perceptual, sensory, and motor correlates of dyslexia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {In this article, the authors report on the development of a short screening tool that deputies in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department could use in the field to help forecast domestic violence incidents in particular households. The data come from more than 500 households to which sheriff's deputies were dispatched in fall 2003. Information on potential predictors was collected at the scene. Outcomes were measured during a 3-month follow-up. Data were analyzed with modern data-mining procedures in which true forecasts were evaluated. A screening instrument was developed based on a small fraction of the information collected. Making the screening instrument more complicated did not improve forecasting skill. Taking the relative costs of false positives and false negatives into account, the instrument correctly forecasted future calls for service about 60% of the time. Future calls involving domestic violence misdemeanors and felonies were correctly forecast about 50% of the time. The 50% figure is important because such calls require a law enforcement response and yet are a relatively small fraction of all domestic violence calls for service.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of elderly persons who responded positively to a question about "severe memory problems" on a mailed health questionnaire yet were missed by the existing health risk algorithm to identify vulnerable elderly persons. A total of 324,471 respondents aged 65 and older completed a primary care health status questionnaire that gathered clinical information to quickly identify members with functional impairment, multiple chronic diseases, and higher medical care needs. The respondents were part of a large, integrated, not-for-profit managed care organization that implemented a model of care for elders using a uniform risk identification method across eight regions. Respondents with severe memory problems were compared to general respondents by morbidity, geriatric syndromes, functional impairments, service utilization, sensory impairments, sociodemographic characteristics, and activities of daily living. Of the respondents, 13,902 persons (4.3%) reported severe memory problems; the existing health risk algorithm missed 47.1% of these. When severe memory problems were included in the risk algorithm, identification increased from 11% to 13%, and risk prevalence by age groups ranged from 4.4% to 40.5%; one third had severe memory problems, a finding that was fairly consistent within age groups (28.4% to 36.5%). A question about severe memory problems should be incorporated into population risk-identification techniques. While false-negative rates are unknown, the false-positive rate of a self-report mail survey appears to be minimal. Persons reporting severe memory problems clearly have multiple comorbidities, higher prevalence of geriatric syndromes, and greater functional and sensory impairments.

Abstract = {This study examines differences between juvenile gang and nongang members participating in a juvenile probation program designed to identify and intervene with youth considered to be high risk for subsequent criminal and delinquent activity. After participating in the Multidisciplinary Team Program, both gang and nongang members significantly improved their grade point average, lowered the number of classes missed, and reduced the number of suspensions. Both groups also improved on family functioning and a decrease in reported alcohol and substance abuse. There were also improvements for gang and nongang members concerning subsequent delinquent activity. The results suggest that at some levels, gang affiliation is not an impediment to treatment programming. A limitation to the study was that gang membership was based on self-report and law enforcement identification, which results in false positive and false negative designations. Additionally, the nongang group may have included youths who escaped being identified as gang members. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {An experiment was designed to test behavioural differences in the detection of deception arising from investigative interviews conducted in either a first or second language. A two (Cantonese or English) by two (deception or truthfulness) between-subjects factorial design was used. Twenty-six postgraduate criminology student observers provided judgments of lying in 20 video-taped interviews of undergraduate subjects randomly assigned to either telling the truth or lying about their opinions on capital punishment. Observers did less well in identifying liars in their first language but were more successful in identifying liars speaking in a second language. However, observers made more mistakes with those telling the truth in a second language. The degree that deceivers deployed countermeasures also varied with second language users reporting less ability to control verbal and non-verbal behavioural cues. Deceivers, irrespective of language, found lying required more cognitive resources than telling the truth and lying in a second language tends to alter one's facial expression or emotion. Behaviour associated with deception is discussed in the context of bilingual 'code switching' that appears to lessen cognitive load while lying and may be a potential marker of deception. Disbelieving-the-truth mistakes, or 'false positives' are as troublesome as false negatives and require attention in the context of cross-cultural interrogations.

Abstract = {Since Durkheim's pioneering study, official suicide statistics have been suspected of underreporting the true suicide rate. A majority of researchers asserts that mistakes are minimal and not systematic while a minority claims that suicide statistics are systematically biased. Lingering uncertainties about suicide rate accuracy call into question the claims of scholarship and the efficacy of prevention programs. From the perspective of the sociology of professions, the critique of suicide accuracy challenges the professional authority of death investigators. Ethnographic observations show that medical examiners tend to underclassify suicides because the suicide classification requires positive proof of suicidal intent and because false negatives do not challenge the authority of medical examiners as much as false positives. Sufficient proof for suicide results from medical examiners' privileging of pathological evidence, the legal threshold to interpret evidence, and close relationships with law enforcement and clinicians. The same professional characteristics that safeguard forensic authority result in suicide underreporting: medical examiners protect their authority by determining suicide conservatively. Relatives acting to avoid the stigma of suicide and public health officials concerned with underreporting have a marginal influence on suicide determinations. This article contributes to the sociology of professions literature by analyzing how a professional group maintains authority in spite of profound criticism from outside parties.

Abstract = {Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test performances cross-sectionally in patients suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, we wanted to determine the sensitivity to amnestic MCI and mild AD, as well as the specificity of different CERAD subtests in our study groups. Material and methods: Fifteen healthy elderly individuals, 15 amnestic MCI patients and 15 probable AD patients suffering from mild dementia were tested with the CERAD neurocognitive dementia screening test. Results: Significant differences were found in all CERAD tests except Constructional praxis (copy) and Clock drawing between the controls and the AD group. The MCI group was differentiated from the controls only in the Wordlist learning test. In the language tests the sensitivity to MCI and AD was quite low and the specificity very high. In the savings scores the sensitivity to AD was high, but the specificity rather low. The Wordlist recognition test screened no false positives using the current cut-off score and the sensitivity to AD was 0.6, but only one MCI patient was detected using the current cut-off score. Raising the cut-off score also raised the sensitivity to MCI without dramatic loss of specificity. Cut-off scores for the Wordlist learning test and Wordlist delayed recall, which have been found to differentiate normal aging from dementia, are lacking in the Finnish CERAD. The current data indicates that the Wordlist learning test might be relatively sensitive to MCI. Conclusions: The results indicate that the Finnish CERAD test battery with its current cut-off scores has low sensitivity to MCI, and using it as a sole cognitive screening instrument for MCI and preclinical dementia might result in false negatives.

Teams were provided with false negative, false positive, or neutral feedback regarding their performance. Results support the hypothesis that the perception of 2 forms of organizational citizenship behavior (helping behavior and civic virtue) in work groups may, in part, be a function of the nature of the performance feedback that group members receive. However, negative feedback appears to play a more critical role than positive feedback in this attributional process.

Abstract = {The detection of an occult tumour in a patient with a suspected paraneoplastic neurological disorder (PND) may be difficult because of the limitations of conventional imaging techniques. [¹⁸F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can visualize a small tumour anywhere within the body. The authors retrospectively reviewed the case notes of 43 unselected patients (aged 41–86 yrs) with suspected PND referred for FDG-PET scanning to determine how useful this technique was when conventional imaging was negative. There were discrete areas of hypermetabolism suggestive of malignancy (positive) in 16 patients. A tissue diagnosis of cancer was subsequently made in 7 patients, further radiological studies were suggestive of cancer in 1 patient, 1 patient subsequently presented with a metastatic deposit which was biopsied, and 4 patients died shortly afterwards without a post-mortem. In 3 patients, subsequent investigations were negative for cancer. These findings confirm that FDG-PET scanning is a useful technique in the detection of small tumours in patients with suspected PND. False positives and false negatives do occur, but at a sufficiently low frequency to justify the clinical usefulness of this technique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (CNPI) were tested in a sample of 62 dementia outpatients (aged 54-88 yrs). The concurrent validity was tested by measuring the Spearman correlation between CNPI subscales with the appropriate subscales of the Alzheimer's disease behavioral pathology rating scale (BEHAVE-AD) and the Chinese Hamilton rating scale of depression (CHDS). The internal consistency reliability, false-negative rates of the screening questions of CNPI and inter-rater reliability were determined. Most CNPI behavioral domains achieved significant correlation with the corresponding BEHAVE-AD and CHDS subscales. Cronbach alpha for the overall reliability was 0.84. The false-negative rates of the screening question were acceptable except for the dysphoria, sleep and appetite domains. The inter-rater reliability was satisfactory with intraclass correlation coefficient of all subscales above 0.9. The study demonstrated the applicability of the CNPI in assessing the neuropsychiatric manifestations of dementia in the Chinese community.

Abstract = {Examined issues of criterion validity and detection of depression employing the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) as a "lab test" to trigger follow-up interviews of ambulatory oncology patients by oncology staff and the possibility of subsequent algorithm-based antidepressant treatment. 60 oncology patients were screened with the ZSDS and then interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Sensitivity and specificity of various cutoffs on the ZSDS and a briefer version, the Brief ZSDS (BZSDS), as they predicted results of the MINI were examined. Correlation of the ZSDS and BZSDS with the MINI overall suggested acceptable levels of criterion validity. Using the mild cutoff on the Zung (score > 48), 14 false negatives and 2 false positives were found. When the more stringent moderate cutoff (score > 56) was used, 25 false negatives and 0 fa1se positives were found. Oncology staff can use such data to make decisions about where to set cut-offs that trigger follow-up based on the allowable amount of error in identifying depressive symptoms. Decisions might be based on factors such as the resources available in a particular site for follow-up or the comfort of particular oncologists and nurses managing and prescribing psychotropic medications.

Abstract = {Examined the prognostic accuracy of initial prodromal symptoms (PSs) to determine if they can indeed predict the subsequent development of psychosis. 695 patients were examined for PSs, between 1987 and 1991, with the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms (BSABS) and the Ninth Version of the Present State Examination. Of 385 patients with no characteristic symptoms at 1st examination, 110 with and 50 without initial PSs were followed between 1995 and 1998. The mean time interval between 1st examination and followup was 9.6 yrs. Diagnoses were given according to criteria valid at the respective time at both assessment times: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria were used at 1st examination and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria at follow-up. According to DSM-IV criteria (A–E), 79 patients had developed schizophrenia in the follow-up period, whereas 81 patients had not. Results indicated that the absence of BSABS PSs excluded the development of a 1st psychotic episode, with a probability of 96%, with the percentage of false negatives being only 1.3%. Yet, for these prodromal symptoms in general, specificity (0.59) and positive predictive values (0.70) were considerably lower than sensitivity (0.98) and negative predictive values (0.96), and the percentage of false positives was still 20.6%.

Abstract = {This study investigates attributions and reported communication in 97 neonatologists who responded to a vignette-based questionnaire depicting a woman with 1 of 3 prenatal screening histories for Down syndrome (DS) who had just given birth to a child with DS: not offered screening, refused screening, or received a false negative result on screening. Neonatologists reported blaming and attributing more control to women who refused prenatal screening for DS. Attributions of blame, but not control, were associated with reports of communicating more negative information on DS to parents. Neonatologists may make attributions about women on the basis of their screening histories, which appear to influence some but not all aspects of how they report communicating a diagnosis of DS.

Abstract = {Parents' ability to make reliable and valid reports about health service utilization is a key research design consideration for studies about the unmet needs of children and adolescents with emotional or behavioral problems. This research report addresses the validity of parents' reports, in particular, parents' rates of false-negative reporting about their children's mental health service use. Findings show that only a few parents of known service users fail to report that their child or adolescent has received services for an emotional or behavioral problem. However, when parents are asked to report about their child's service use with specific providers or in specific service settings, the rate of false-negative reporting tends to increase, and in some circumstances this increase is dramatic. Logistic regression results indicate that false-negative reporting is more likely to occur among parents whose children are male, less frequent service users, or service users whose use is less recent. After controlling for these factors, the authors did not find a significant difference in the rate of false-negative reporting for parents of Anglo and Latino children.

Abstract = {Presents a phenomenological study of three false negative cases according to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) of major depressive disorder identified by a semi-structured clinical interview. In a study of 87 unselected women with 23 of them suffering from a major depressive disorder (according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria), three cases of major depressive disorders were not identified as potential cases by the EPDS. The symptomatology of these three false negative cases was also assessed by a semi-structured interview (Present State Examination). Comparisons between EPDS scores and the scores of two other self report questionnaires (the General Health Questionnaire-28 and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) suggest that EPDS is better at identifying depressed postnatal women with anhedonic and anxious symptomatology rather than those whose depression presents mainly with psychomotor retardation.

Abstract = {Used a political survey data set of Japanese voters that included a number of "Don't know" responses to explore whether or not "Don't know" respondents had underlying attitudes but refrained from expressing them. Nonresponses were treated as nonignorably missing (i.e., "Don't know" responses were related to the answer of the question in some partially unknown way). The authors proposed a method to estimate parameters in a logit model when the covariates are nonignorably missing. The method simultaneously used 2 generalized linear models: the proportional odds model for the response variable Party-Support and the multinomial logit model for the nonresponse. "Don't know" responses to the Cabinet support question depended on whether the Ss supported the Cabinet, indicating the existence of false negatives. The choice of which party to support was based on Ss' ideology, city size, and stance toward the Cabinet, even with false negatives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recent controversy over memories retrieved in therapy has highlighted the importance of increasing understanding of individual differences in suggestibility and false-memory production. The purpose of this laboratory study was to assess the ability of several clinically relevant variables (acquiescence, self-esteem and negative affect) to predict the tendency to yield to suggestive questioning, to alter responses in the face of interpersonal criticism or to produce false memories (in this study, false recall of implied words). Ss were 103 female college students (mean age 18.5 yrs). Results indicated that acquiescence significantly predicted suggestibility, as did competence self-esteem scores, but global self-esteem and negative affect scores did not. False-memory production (i.e., false recall of implied words) was associated with higher levels of both acquiescence and negative affect, but the tendency to alter responses after criticism was not significantly predicted by any variable.

Abstract = {This article argues that child sexual abuse interviews can go astray in two different ways: (1) improper interviewing has the potential to elicit false allegations from children, and (2) clumsy interviewing does not typically produce false allegations, but may have other negative consequences, particularly for child victims. The article clarifies the distinction between the two kinds of bad interviewing and suggests that clumsy interviewing is the more common of the two. The potential negative consequences of both improper and clumsy interviewing are described, along with implications for prosecutors, police, and child protection services. In the authors' opinion, improper interviewing can probably be eliminated rather easily, but clumsy interviewing may be considerably more resistant to change.

Five hundred young adults reported ASPD; retrospective CD; current problem behavior; and, at ages 12 to 15 years, contemporaneous CD. True-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative CD and ASPD groups were identified. The results supported the hypotheses. Participants whose current behavior agreed with past behavior provided reliable retrospective CD reports. Inaccurate diagnoses occurred among participants whose current behavior was inconsistent with past behavior, either becoming more problematic (CD and ASPD false positives) or less problematic (CD and ASPD false negatives) over time.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine putative differences in the quantitative and qualitative performance of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for assessing dietary calcium intake across age and sex in the Greek population. Materials and methods: A total of 351 children (189 girls and 162 boys, aged 11.9 ± 1.2 years), 260 adults (192 women and 68 men, aged 29.6 ± 2.7 years) and 390 elderly individuals (317 women and 73 men, aged 68.6 ± 4.6 years) were recruited. Estimates of calcium intake from the 30-item FFQ were compared with those from a multi-pass 24-h recall. Results: The FFQ significantly underestimated mean calcium intake in all age groups and both sexes (P < 0.05). The magnitude of underestimation, however, was greater in adults (-207 ± 344 mg day-1), less in the elderly (-137 ± 310 mg day-1) and even less in children (-74 ± 340 mg day-1; P < 0.025), with no differences between sexes. Calcium intakes by the two methods were positively and significantly correlated in all study groups (r = 0.536-0.739, P < 0.001). Cohen's weighted kappa statistic ranged from 0.39 to 0.57, indicating moderate agreement between the two methods. The 95% limits of agreement were comparably wide across age and sex (boys: -762, 585 mg day-1; girls: -747, 624 mg day-1; adult men: -972, 505 mg day-1; adult women: -867, 412 mg day-1; elderly men: -858, 486 mg day-1; elderly women: -732, 480 mg day-1). A significant association between age, sex and the classification of individuals as true/false positive/negative was detected (P < 0.001), implying that sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the FFQ were not independent of the age and sex of the participants. Gross misclassification by the FFQ ranged from 0% to 4.2%, whereas 75.3-87.3% of the subjects were correctly classified. In this respect, the FFQ performed similarly across the study groups (P = 0.065). Without controlling for age, however, gross misclassification appeared to be higher in females than in males (3.2% versus 0.7%, respectively, P = 0.048). Conclusions: There may be several significant differences in the quantitative and qualitative performance of a calcium-specific FFQ across age and sex. This should be taken into account when attempting to evaluate dietary calcium intake in men and women or in different age groups, as some of the differences between study groups may actually be due to the different response of these groups to the FFQ.

Abstract = {For 30 years Gallup's (Science 167:86-87, 1970) mark test, which consists of confronting a mirror-experienced test animal with its own previously altered mirror image, usually a color mark on forehead, eyebrow or ear, has delivered valuable results about the distribution of visual self-recognition in non-human primates. Chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and, less frequently, gorillas can learn to correctly understand the reflection of their body in a mirror. However, the standard version of the mark test is good only for positively proving the existence of self-recognition. Conclusive statements about the lack of self-recognition are more difficult because of the methodological constraints of the test. This situation has led to a persistent controversy about the power of Gallup's original technique. We devised a new variant of the test which permits more unequivocal decisions about both the presence and absence of self-recognition. This new procedure was tested with marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), following extensive training with mirror-related tasks to facilitate performance in the standard mark test. The results show that a slightly altered mark test with a new marking substance (chocolate cream) can help to reliably discriminate between true negative results, indicating a real lack of ability to recognize oneself in a mirror, from false negative results that are due to methodological particularities of the standard test. Finally, an evolutionary hypothesis is put forward as to why many primates can use a mirror instrumentally - i.e. know how to use it for grasping at hidden objects - while failing in the decisive mark test.

Abstract = {Objective: Our goal was to analyze the retest reliability and validity of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in a primary-care setting and recommend a cut-off value for the different alcohol-related diagnoses. Method: Participants recruited from general practices (GPs) in two northern German cities received the AUDIT, which was embedded in a health-risk questionnaire. In total, 10,803 screenings were conducted. The retest reliability was tested on a subsample of 99 patients, with an intertest interval of 30 days. Sensitivity and specificity at a number of different cut-off values were estimated for the sample of alcohol consumers (n = 8,237). For this study, 1,109 screen-positive patients received a diagnostic interview. Individuals who scored less than five points in the AUDIT and also tested negative in a second alcohol-related screen were defined as "negative" (n = 6,003). This definition was supported by diagnostic interviews of 99 screen-negative patients from which no false negatives could be detected. As the gold standard for detection of an alcohol-use disorder (AUD), we used the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (MCIDI), which is based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. Results: On the item level, the reliability, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), ranged between .39 (Item 9) and .98 (Item 10). For the total score, the ICC was .95. For cut-off values of eight points and five points, 87.5% and 88.9%, respectively, of the AUDIT-positives, and 98.9% and 95.1%, respectively, of the AUDIT-negatives were identically identified at retest, with κ = .86 and κ = .81. At the cut-off value of five points, we determined good combinations of sensitivity and specificity for the following diagnoses: alcohol dependence (sensitivity and specificity of .97 and .88, respectively), AUD (.97 and .92), and AUD and/or at-risk consumption (.97 and .91). Conclusions: Embedded in a health-risk questionnaire in primary-care settings, the AUDIT is a reliable and valid screening instrument to identify at-risk drinkers and patients with an AUD. Our findings strongly suggest a lowering of the recommended cut-off value of eight points. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that providing feedback to therapists based on comparing their clients' progress to a set of rational, clinically derived algorithms delineating various categories of progress has enhanced outcomes for clients predicted to show poor treatment outcomes (signal-alarms). One prior study indicated that an empirically derived method more accurately predicts outcome than the rational method. The present study replicated the comparison of empirical and rational methods, while adding an additional layer of effect size analyses to further clarify predictive accuracy. The two methods were approximately equivalent in their accurate detection of cases that had a final negative outcome. However, the rational method had significantly lower overall predictive accuracy due to its high percentage of false negative predictions. Further, progressively more optimistic predictions based on the empirical method were associated with greater improvement for the average client. This was not the case for the rational method.

Abstract = {The at-risk concept is described and its use in the literature on pathological gambling is discussed. An epidemiologic perspective is proposed and the use of risk, at-risk, and not-at-risk are discussed within this framework. It is shown that within the epidemiologic framework the concept of risk applies to nongamblers as well as gamblers, and some nongamblers are theoretically at risk. An example of the application of risk is provided within the context of smoking and the meaning of risk. The frequent assignment of gamblers with scores of 1 or 2 into the same category as those who score 0 is viewed as problematic and is discussed in terms of true negatives and false negatives and the likelihood of pathological gambling among these gamblers. The need for researchers to identify the determinants and indicators of risk is stressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objectives: Depression is a frequent feature of schizophrenia but the cognitive processes involved in its development and maintenance are unclear. Recent studies have shown that clinical depression is associated with faulty inhibitory mechanisms of selective attention for negative information. The current study examined whether patients with schizophrenia also have an attentional bias towards negative stimuli. The inhibitory processes of interference control and task-shifting abilities were also examined to assess whether patients would show a selective impairment. Method: Forty-three patients with schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls completed the Affective Shifting Task. Results: As a group, schizophrenia patients did not show an attentional bias for negative material. However, those patients with high levels of depression demonstrated faster latencies when negative words were the targets, and higher depression scores were found to be associated with an increasing number of false alarms for negative words when they were not the targets. The results also showed that patients had impaired interference control but intact task-shifting abilities. Conclusions: Faulty inhibitory mechanisms of selective attention for negative information are not a general feature of schizophrenia but appear to be selective to those with a depressed mood. The results highlight the need for further studies examining the exact nature of the affective dysfunction in schizophrenia and the cognitive processes supporting negative emotions.

Abstract = {This article describes the potential impact of SNPs on analyses of gene expression differences and introduces an approach called SNP masking, which implements removal of SNP-affected probes. SNP masking is a valuable and feasible approach that can ameliorate these hybridization problems. Researchers over the years have identified millions of SNPs in the mouse genome alone, and there are many more asyet- unidentified SNPs that also could affect gene expression probes in hybridization-based assays. Even for the well-studied B6 versus D2 strains, it is estimated that there are many more SNPs than have been described so far. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that investigators performing microarray analyses identify false-positives and false-negatives before carrying out costly followup confirmation experiments on their samples.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by P. Mattos and L. A. Rohde (see record [rid]2007-13484-002[/rid]). The authors wondered about the data supporting the use of only four questions as a preliminary screening for ADHD using the K-SADS PL. Having used the K-SADS-PL extensively in research on adolescents in both Canada and New Zealand, I analyzed these data sets to explore the discriminant validity of the screening items. Overall, the results indicated that the screening process of the K-SADS-PL is working as it should, that is, a low percentage of false negatives (indeed, zero), showing excellent sensitivity, but also a high percentage of false positives (26.2%), a rate one would expect with a screen and indicative of moderate specificity. Mattos and Rohde query about have not been used to make decisions on individual items. Nevertheless, I agree that they could be sharpened and due consideration given to their specificity to the DSM-IV-TR items. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Tested predictions derived from 2 different models regarding performance efficiency among optimists and pessimists. Following the logic of M. E. P. Seligman et al's (1990) experiment with varsity collegiate swimmers, 128 16–32 yr old college students performed a brief, but highly stressful vigilance task. Half of the Ss were given false feedback indicating poor performance; the others experienced a non-evaluative display at that point. All Ss were then asked to repeat the vigil. Half the observers were assessed as high optimists and half as high pessimists. The pessimists showed a steeper vigilance decrement than the optimists, consistent with a model (M. F. Scheier and C. S. Carver, 1987) that proposes that pessimists are more emotion-focused under stress than optimists, and hence would be less attentive to the vigilance display, regardless of feedback condition. The false negative feedback actually turned out to be ineffective; hence, based on Seligman's account of the swimmer study, which requires effective negative feedback, there should have been no vigilance performance difference between optimists and pessimists, either pre or postfeedback.

Abstract = {The effects of low efficacy expectancies on sexual arousal in sexually functional males were examined. 26 men (aged 20–50 yrs) were randomly assigned to either a false negative feedback group or a no-feedback group. Measures of physiological arousal, subjective arousal, efficacy expectancies, and affect were obtained. After viewing 2 erotic films, participants in the false feedback group were told that their response was less than that of the average participant. Participants in the control group did not receive any feedback. Results indicate that false feedback lowered the level of efficacy expectancies and led to a significant decline in physiological response to a 3rd erotic film. Moreover, post-feedback efficacy expectancies were strongly associated with physiological response to the 3rd film. Counter to predictions and despite its effects on physiological arousal, false feedback did not lead to a significant decline in subjective arousal or an increase in negative affect. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of cognitive factors in the etiology and treatment of sexual dysfunction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The efficacy of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire—Revised (PDQ—R) as a screening instrument was examined in a sample of 137 anxious outpatients (aged 19–62 yrs). The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) Axis II (SCID-II) was used as the criterion. The PDQ—R cut-offs were adjusted until the maximum kappa agreement for each scale was reached. The results showed that increasing the cut-offs decreased the number of false-positive diagnoses and only slightly increased the number of false-negative diagnoses. Inclusion of the PDQ—R as a screening instrument, followed by the SCID-II to verify the false-positive diagnoses appears to be a promising method for the categorical assessment of personality disorders. However, more studies are needed, using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) instruments to determine the optimal cutoffs. The following aspects should be considered as well: (1) the differences in prevalence rates of personality disorders, (2) the ability of the PDQ—R to differentiate between state and trait phenomena, (3) the consequences of the false-negative diagnoses and (4) the limited validity of the personality disorder definitions.

Seven male and 5 female (mean age 33.03 yrs) schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms and 8 male and 4 female (mean age 37.25 yrs) schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms, as well as non-patient control Sts, were asked to recognize emotional stimuli of happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Dependent measures were the percentage of correct responses, and the incorrect use of an emotion category owing to false recognition. Schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms exhibited a generalized emotion-recognition deficit, and their use of emotion categories during false recognition was random. Schizophrenic patients with positive symptoms showed a deficit in their recognition of 'sad' emotion and were 'positively biased' to the category 'happy' as reflected by its most frequent usage during false recognition.

Prevention may be thwarted by expressing overriding concern for labels and stigma, objecting to a medical model and failure-driven services, preferring false negatives to false positives, proposing a paradigm shift, calling special education ineffective, misconstruing the least restrictive and least intrusive intervention, protesting the percentage of children receiving services, complaining that special education already costs too much, maintaining developmental optimism, denouncing disproportional identification, defending diversity, and denying or dodging deviance.

Acceptable interrater reliability (Kappa estimates) was obtained for the presence or absence of the 9 individual BPD criteria. Diagnostic efficiency statistics, sensitivity, specificity, false positive and false negative rates, positive predictive power, negative predictive power, overall classification rate, and Kappa with the clinical diagnosis were obtained for all 9 BPD criteria. The diagnostic efficiency data indicated that BPD criteria 1 (abandonment) and 2 (unstable relationships) functioned best in our inpatient sample, whereas criterion 9 (stress-related paranoia) performed the poorest. A stepwise logistic regression showed that the combination of BPD criteria 2, 1, 6 (unstable affect), and 3 (identity) provided the best prediction of group membership (BPD or non-BPD).

Abstract = {Explored the relative value of various methods of assessing childhood psychopathology. The authors compared 4 groups of children (201 families, children aged 5–17 yrs): those who met criteria for 1 or more DSM diagnoses and scored high on parent symptoms checklists, those who met psychopathology criteria on either 1 of these 2 assessment approaches alone, and those who met no psychopathology assessment criteria. Parents of Ss completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), after which children and parents were administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (2.1). Children and parents also completed other survey measures and symptom report inventories. The 4 groups were compared against external validators to examine the merits of false-positive (FP) and false negative (FN) cases. True-positive cases (those who met DSM criteria and scored high on the CBCL) differed significantly from the true-negative cases on most external validators. FP and FN cases had intermediate levels of most risk factors and external validators. FP cases were not normal per se because they scored significantly above the true-negative group on a number of risk factors and external validators. A similar but less marked pattern was noted for FNs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Patients with false positive results on the panic disorder screen did not differ from patients with false negatives results with regard to rates of other psychiatric disorders, functional impairment, or mental health service utilization. In contrast, patients with false negative depression screen results had significantly more psychiatric disorders and functional impairment than those with false positive depression results. It is concluded that a substantial number of patients with either false positive or false negative screen results met diagnostic criteria for other mental disorders. Given the nominal burden of follow-up assessments for positive screens, these data suggest that erring on the side of sensitivity may have been preferable when algorithms for these screens were selected.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Mona K. Beyer (see record [rid]2007-14648-003[/rid]). The numbers of patients in the Beyer et al. study were small and larger series deserve to be analyzed. The diagnoses were performed using clinical criteria and there is the risk of false positives and false negatives with such criteria. Finally, patients with Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were not exactly matched for age, dementia duration, and treatments, while patterns of cerebral atrophy on voxel based morphometry in these syndromes may vary with clinical and demographic variables, as it is known for Alzheimer disease. Statistical adjustments, as performed by Beyer and colleagues, might not be sufficient to eliminate this potential bias. Interestingly, such a bias could also explain why Beyer and colleagues' results are in contradiction with those of another comparable MRI study published some 3 years ago. The difference in cortical gray matter atrophy reported in this issue of Neurology provides novel arguments to support the existence of structural differences between PDD and DLB. This pilot observation does not challenge, however, the concept that PDD and DLB might still be variants of the same. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The utility of recidivistic prediction is limited by the false positive problem: predictions of failure (recidivism) that do not occur. False negatives (predicted successes but observed failures) are also worrisome, and together both types of error can be formally evaluated by what Blumstein, Farrington, and Moitra call the civil-libertarian ratio: the ratio of the subjective cost of a false positive to a false negative. Choice of a recidivistic criterion and selection of a proportion of offenders for criminal justice intervention have implications for the evaluation of the disutility or subjective cost associated with various civil-libertarian ratios. Logistic regression models of four recidivistic criteria are evaluated to demonstrate how base rate (observed failure rate) and selection ratio (proportion selected to fail) affect the disutility associated with a range of civil-libertarian ratios. Use of civil-libertarian ratios by criminal justice policy makers is demonstrated. Predictive utility is relatively difficult to achieve for rare recidivistic events if the decisions involve severe deprivation of liberty (incarceration decisions). Predictive utility is easier to achieve for more common forms of recidivism or in decision contexts where there is less concern for false positives, such as for "intermediate sanctions."

Abstract = {Two versions of an inhibition model of successful belief–desire reasoning were tested with false belief tasks in 49 4–5 yr olds. Ss were required to pass the standard false-belief task for inclusion in this study. The task protocols included negative desire and mixed-up man tasks. The authors' model predicted that the difficulty of a double inhibition would exceed the sum of the difficulty of 2 single inhibitions. On the single inhibition deriving from negative desire, only 1 of 16 Ss failed. On the single inhibition deriving from the Think (false belief) question, only 2 out of 18 Ss failed. If double inhibition is simply the sum of 2 single inhibitions, then a 17% failure rate on the Prediction question in the false belief + negative desire condition should be expected. The observed failure rate was 62%, a result consistent with the prediction of the authors' model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Neurobehavioral measures were taken in 384 German 5–7-yr-olds from 3 different cities as a repeat of measures taken 3 yrs earlier. Lead (PbB) in blood samples and mercury (HgU) urinary excretion were measured. Dependent variables included subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) vocabulary and block design and the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System 2 (NES2). Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were covariates. The average PbB was 42.5 μg/l (upper 95% value = 89 μg/l). The overall average HgU was 0.16 μg/24 hrs. No significant associations between HgU and any target variable were found but there were significant negative associations between PbB and verbal intelligence and false-positive responses, as well as false-negatives in the Continuous Performance Test. Parental education was the most important confounder for WISC performance; visual contrast sensitivity and computer familiarity were predictive of performance in computer-based NES subtests. Non-IQ measures (measures of sustained attention) are negatively affected in children with 95% of PbB levels below 90 μg/l; the causative role of lead in altering IQ functions remains equivocal, because important covariates could not be controlled for.

Abstract = {Epidemiological concerns about base rates, true and false positives, and the possibility of an epidemic of therapy-induced false memories are frequently raised in the debate over delayed memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Most references to epidemiological concepts emphasize the potential problem of false positives arising from therapists' assessments of CSA but neglect the potential problem of false negatives. A more balanced epidemiological analysis that includes estimations of the risks of both false positives and false negatives is more relevant to clinical concerns and better identifies gaps in our understanding of this area. This article presents estimates for certain epidemiological variables based on available research and a range of suppositions. The evidence at hand suggests that the rate of false negatives for CSA history poses a larger epidemiological problem than the rate of false positives. A glossary of epidemiological terms is appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Determined how much training was needed to stabilize the response strategy prior to actual visual field assessment in 106 5–8 yr olds and evaluated the reliability and acceptable duration of automated static perimetry. A specially designed familiarization procedure was used to train the children to: (1) gaze at the center of the visual field while paying attention to light stimuli projected onto the periphery, and (2) press the buzzer only when light stimuli were perceived. The subsequent examination phase consisted of 15 successive identical blocks of 27 trials (12 stimulus trials, 12 false-positive catch-trials, and 3 false-negative catch-trials), and was stopped before the end if signs of fatigue appeared. Results show that age had a marked influence both on endurance and on response reliability. The increase in false-negative responses toward the end indicates that examination is no longer reliable, and should be stopped. It is concluded that most children as young as 5 yrs can undergo examination by automated static perimetry. This study is Part I of a 2-part study (see record [rid]1998-10171-010[/rid]).

Abstract = {Attempted to derive quality of life values for the 4 key breast screening outcomes (true negative, false positive, true positive and false negative), including the effects of the screening and treatment processes. The true negative and false positive descriptions were temporary health states, lasting for short term durations (12 mo) and the true positive and false negative outcomes were chronic health states lasting for long term durations (rest of life). Descriptions of breast screening outcomes were valued using the time trade-off (TTO) technique and the visual analogue scale. Paired comparisons between TTO values for states with the same duration found a difference between the true negative and the false positive TTO values but no difference for true positive and false negative descriptions. Results highlight several important methodological issues, such as the use of the 2 stage procedure for valuing temporary health states, the impact of duration on values, the impact of anchor points, and the importance of qualitative analysis of respondents' values.

Abstract = {Assessment of impairment in memory and/or intelligence required for a diagnosis of dementia often involves use of the Fuld or Coolidge formulae for an abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (WAIS--R). The present study was designed to compare the hit rate of the Fuld and Coolidge formulae with that of the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) in a group of 29 elderly chronic psychiatric patients (aged 55–80 yrs), 1 subgroup of which was diagnosed with mild dementia. Using neurological or neuropsychological evaluations as criteria for dementia, it was found that the DRS yielded no false positives, whereas the Fuld and Coolidge formulae both selected a false positive case. The DRS was found to identify only 1 false negative (1 of 15), whereas the Fuld and Coolidge formulae identified 12 of 15 false negatives. Such a significant difference in selection rates raises questions about use of the Fuld and Coolidge formulae for screening of patients for the purpose of identifying the early signs of dementia. In addition to its respectable hit rate with these patients, the DRS was found to be significantly correlated with the high, middle, and low levels of adaptive functioning to which subjects were assigned at the treatment facility.

Abstract = {This paper illustrates the application of the powerful statistical techniques of multivariate behavioral research to the identification of those offenders about whose presence the community should be notified under terms of Megan's Law and its variants. A stepwise multiple regression was calculated among a group of 52 pedophiles serving sentences in a specialized prison for the treatment of sex offenders with number of prior arrests for any/all felony offenses as the criterion variable; scores on the MMPI and the Limbic System Checklist, age of the victim in the instant offense, and age of the offender functioned as "post-dictor" variables. Eight variables were extracted (Pd, Mf, victim's age, Pa, F, Si, LSCL score, K), yielding a multiple R of .683. When the criterion is truncated into meta-categories (one or more arrests vs. zero or none), a precision-weighted equation produced 90.4% "true positives" but only 9.6% "false negatives." It is proposed that the methodology presented herein (rather than the specific results obtained) can be extrapolated to other jurisdictions as a scientifically sound methodology that both reduces the rate of false negatives from that expected by chance and is likely to prove defensible in litigation.

Abstract = {Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is the reference screening technique for acoustic neuromas, but because of a few false negatives and the increasing performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), its role as the standard method has been questioned. We assessed sensitivity of screening tests in 89 patients with surgically proven acoustic neuromas. Sensitivity of ABR was 92%; 94% for extracanalicular neuromas and 77% for intracanalicular neuromas. For stapedius reflex (SR), sensitivity was 84% and for caloric vestibular response (CVR) 86%. The combined sensitivity of ABR+SR was 97% and of ABR+RS+CVR 98%. For false negatives, the greatest diameter including the intracanalicular portion was always less than 18 mm, with a mean of 15 mm, and none of these tumours reached the brainstem. For patients with unilateral cochleo-vestibular deficit, we propose ABR and SR as first-line screening tests. These tests are repeated at 6 months and at 1 year in the case of normal results. MRI is ordered for patients whose auditory threshold is too low and for those whose ABR or SR results favour retrocochlear disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

All high-risk children and a random sample of low-risk children subsequently underwent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV)-based diagnostic assessment through parental diagnostic interviews. Diagnostic utility was summarized by sensitivity, specificity, predictive utilities of positive and negative tests, and efficiency, all of which were estimated using an approach that accounted for the sampling design. Overall, both the ASQ and the ADDES yielded substantial numbers of false positives and false negatives among this population of children, indicating that alternative approaches will be required to accurately and efficiently identify children in need of ADHD services.

Abstract = {Assessed the diagnostic value for Alzheimer's disease (AD) of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and MRI, separately and in combination. The study was part of a 2-part population-based study of mental functioning among noninstutionalized elderly living in Amsterdam. Participants were randomly selected within strata of cognitive function to obtain a sample of 10 patients with AD and 41 clinically normal patients (all Ss aged 67–86 yrs), of whom 22 displayed some cognitive impairment and fulfilled criteria for minimal dementia. Coronal T1-weighted MRI was used to visualize the medial temporal lobe. Regional cerebral blood flow on SPECT was assessed using technetium 99m-HMPAO in 3 manually drawn regions of interest (frontal, parietal, and temporoparietal). Medial temporal lobe atrophy differed significantly between AD and normal Ss, with a sensitivity for AD of 70% and a specificity of 76%. None of the 3 SPECT ratios differed between normal and AD Ss. The temporoparietal/cerebellar ratio had a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 71% at a cutoff of 0.76. When both tests were positive the combined sensitivity was low (20%), but the false-positive rate was also very low (5%). A negative result on MRI or any SPECT ratio yielded a high specificity but also a high false-negative rate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the undergraduate students' (n = 369) evaluations of drug testing programs and the relation between the Ss' attitudes toward drug testing and their belief in a just world. In a series of 3 experiments, 5 variables were manipulated in order to determine their impact on Ss' evaluations of drug testing programs: false positive rate, consequences of a positive test, false negative rate, safety implications of drug-impaired performance, and ability of the test to distinguish between previous drug use and current drug-based impairment. Results indicate evaluations were inversely related to the false positive rate and were more favorable when a positive test result led to rehabilitation than when it led to termination of employment. Inconsistent effects on evaluations were observed for ability of the test to distinguish between previous drug use and current drug-based impairment, false negative rate, and implications of drug-impaired performance for public safety. There was also mixed evidence concerning the relation between evaluations and respondent belief in a just world. These results provide some support for J. M. Crant and T. S.

Abstract = {Examined 8–12.5 yr old female children who presented to a hospital emergency room with physical complaints which were later determined to be compelling evidence of sexual abuse. Cases were selected where there was no prior history, suspicion, or disclosure of abuse, and the child failed to disclose any sexual contact in the initial sexual abuse disclosure interview. These interview "false negatives" previously had been found to be related to caretaker biases against considering the possibility that abuse may have occurred. However, it was not clear what role, if any, individual psychological processes may have played in the false negative interviews. The present study re-located and assessed a small number of these children for dissociative and behavioral symptoms. Two non-contemporaneous comparison groups were used: (1) "true-positive" (i.e., disclosing) sexually abused children from the same hospital emergency room and (2) nonabused, non-psychiatric controls from the same hospital. False negative children were found to have significantly higher levels of dissociative symptoms, although they did not differ from true positives and non-abused controls on general behavioral problems. The results are consistent with an association between false negatives in sexual abuse interviews and dissociation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A formula for detecting faked Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery profiles was validated on 68 experimental malingerers and adequately motivated patients matched on education, age, and severity of profile. The formula was then cross-validated on 51 malingerers and 202 patients. The formula yielded a cross-validated 23% false negative rate and a 9% false positive rate, for an overall hit rate of 88%. If normal and profoundly impaired profiles are eliminated from the cross-validation analysis, the false negative rate is 17% and the false positive rate 7%, for an overall hit rate of 91%.

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the association of psychological, as well as physical and sociodemographic, indicators with patients' ratings of personal health status and diabetes control and to investigate the association of mental health and depression with errors in the perception of diabetes control. Method: A sociodemographically diverse sample of 623 diabetes patients was recruited from the general medicine clinics of a county health care system and a Veterans Affairs health care system. We examined three types of determinants of patients' health perceptions: physical health indicators (symptoms, comorbid diagnoses, and glycosylated hemoglobin or HbA1c levels), psychological health indicators (general mental health and diabetes-related worry), and sociodemographic factors (age, race, gender, income, and education). Results: After controlling for patients' sociodemographic characteristics, perceived general health was associated with patients' symptom burden and emotional distress (but not with patients' HbA1c levels). Perceived diabetes control additionally was associated with HbA1c and diabetes-related worries. Further analyses showed that both mental health and diagnosed depression were associated with errors in personal appraisals of diabetes control, with depressed patients more often inaccurately assessing their glycemic control as poor (false-positive error) and nondepressed patients more often missing poor HbA1c levels (false-negative error). Conclusions: Findings indicate that patients use a comprehensive model for assessing their general health and that depression may lead to more accurate assessments of poor glucose control.

Abstract = {Mental health professionals can assist legal decision makers in cases of allegations of child sexual abuse by collecting data using forensic interviews, psychological testing, and record reviews, and by summarizing relevant findings from social science research. Significant controversy surrounds another key task performed by mental health professionals in most child sexual abuse evaluations, i.e., deciding whether or not to substantiate unconfirmed abuse allegations. The available evidence indicates that, on the whole, these substantiation decisions currently lack adequate psychometric reliability and validity: an analysis of empirical research findings leads to the conclusion that at least 24% of all of these decisions are either false positive or false negative errors. Surprisingly, a reanalysis of existing research also indicates that it may be possible to develop reliable, objective procedures to improve the consistency and quality of decision making in this domain. A preliminary, empirically-grounded procedure for making substantiation decisions is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {We reviewed 71 United States-based MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale (MAC), as revised (MAC-R) studies totaling almost 32,000 Ss, with adolescent and adult substance abusers, from studies published since the last MAC reviews (1989) through 2001. Results suggest that the MAC, and to some extent, the MAC-R, significantly correlates with measures of alcohol and substance abuse in both male and female adolescents and adults, across a diverse spectrum of the use-abuse continuum. Nonclinical groups (100%) scored below the clinical ranges on the MAC/MAC-R, while 79% of adolescent substance abusing groups scored > R 23, indicative of problems with substance abuse. Persons who abused alcohol, drugs, and poly drugs had mean MAC/MAC-R scores > 23, which ranged from 77% to 100% of the cases. The MAC/MAC-R does well in discriminating persons who abuse substances compared to nonclinical, nonabusing groups, but appears to lose diagnostic efficiency with psychiatric patients, and especially with medical patients with seizure disorders. Using R > 25 seems to improve diagnostic accuracy with this population. Meaning of false positives and false negatives were explored and discussed.

Abstract = {In two previous studies, it was observed that schizophrenic patients display increased confidence in memory errors compared with controls. The patient group displayed an increased proportion of errors in their knowledge system, quantified as the percentage of high-confident responses that are errors. The latter phenomenon has been termed knowledge corruption and is put forward as a risk factor for the emergence of delusions. In the present study, knowledge corruption was analyzed separately for different aspects of memory errors. A source-monitoring task was used, for which participants (30 schizophrenic patients with past or current paranoid ideas and 15 healthy controls) were asked to provide associates for each of 20 prime words. Later, participants were required to recognize studied words among distractor words, judge the original source, and provide a confidence rating for the most recent decision. Schizophrenic patients displayed greater confidence in memory errors compared with controls. Knowledge corruption was observed to be significantly greater in schizophrenic patients relative to controls for false-positive and false-negative judgments. It is proposed that reliance on false knowledge represents a candidate mechanism for the emergence of fixed false beliefs (i.e., delusions).

Abstract = {Survey-based studies on the prevalence and causes of deviant behavior very much depend on the honesty of respondents. However, the validity of self-reports is rarely investigated. We report on a external validation of self-reported delinquency of male juveniles based on two survey samples--face-to-face interviews in households (N=309), and paper and pencil interviews in school (N=337)--which have been done in 1999 and 2000 in Freiburg and are used for record checks of self-reported police contacts both on the individual and aggregate level. Individual-level record checks reveal that a majority of respondents has honestly reported contacts with the police, while there are a considerable number of both 'false negative' and 'false positive' answers which come predominately from respondents with low educational and social status and of migration background. As these groups show high non-response rates as well, the correlation between delinquency and socio-economic status is likely to be underestimated. The school survey, on the other hand, yields higher and more realistic prevalence rates. However, comparisons between the two survey modes hint at differential effects of social desirability which question the validity of self-reports by respondents with high educational status. Survey results on self-reported delinquency should generally be interpreted with great caution, and more research on the mode effects of class room interviews are deemed necessary.

Abstract = {Background: An explicit clinical significance (CS) criterion was added to many DSM-IV diagnoses in an attempt to more closely approximate the clinical diagnostic process and reduce the proportion of false positives in epidemiological studies. The American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, Risk and Protective Factors Project (AI-SUPERPFP) offered a unique opportunity to examine the success of this effort. Objective: To determine the impact of distress, impairment, and help-seeking reported in a lay structured interview on concordance with a clinical reappraisal. Further, to test the efficacy of 5 operationalizations of CS on the concordance and prevalence of DSM-IV lifetime disorders. Design: Completed between 1997 and 2000, a cross-sectional probability sample survey with clinical reappraisal of approximately 10% of participants. Setting: General community. Participants: A population-based sample of 3084 members of 2 American Indian tribal groups, who were between the ages of 15 and 54 years and resided on or near their home reservations, were randomly sampled from the tribal rolls and participated in structured psychiatric interviews. Clinical reappraisals were conducted with approximately 10% of the lay-interview participants. The response rate for the lay interview was 75%, and for the clinical reappraisal it was 72%. Main Outcomes Measures: The AI-SUPERPFP Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a culturally adapted version of the CIDI, University of Michigan version. Adapted to assess DSM-IV diagnoses, questions assessing the CS criterion were inserted in all diagnostic modules. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) was used in the clinical reappraisal. Results: Most participants who qualified as having AISUPERPFP CIDI lifetime disorders reported at least moderate levels of distress or impairment. Evidence of increased concordance between the CIDI and the SCID was lacking when more restrictive operationalizations of CS were used; indeed, the CIDI was very likely to underdiagnose disorders compared with the SCID (false negatives). Concomitantly, the CS operationalizations affected prevalence rates dramatically. Conclusion: The CS criterion, at least as operationalized to date, demonstrates little effectiveness in increasing the validity of diagnoses using lay-administered structured interviews.

Abstract = {Control theories claim that information about performance is often used by multiple goal systems. A proposition tested here was that performance information can create discrepancies in self-concept goals, directing cognitive resources away from the task goal system. To manipulate performance information, 160 undergraduates were given false positive or false negative normative feedback while working on a task that did or did not require substantial cognitive resources. Half of the participants were then given an opportunity to reaffirm their self-concepts following feedback, whereas half were not. Feedback sign positively related to performance only for those working on the cognitively intense task and not given a chance to reaffirm. Otherwise, feedback sign was negatively related to performance, albeit weakly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: A researcher must carefully balance the risk of 2 undesirable outcomes when designing a clinical trial: false-positive results (type I error) and false-negative results (type II error). In planning the study, careful attention is routinely paid to statistical power (i.e., the complement of type II error) and corresponding sample size requirements. However, Bonferroni-type alpha adjustments to protect against type I error for multiple tests are often resisted. Here, a simple strategy is described that adjusts alpha for multiple primary efficacy measures, yet maintains statistical power for each test. Method: To illustrate the approach, multiplicity-adjusted sample size requirements were estimated for effects of various magnitude with statistical power analyses for 2-tailed comparisons of 2 groups using χ² tests and t tests. These analyses estimated the required sample size for hypothetical clinical trial protocols in which the prespecified number of primary efficacy measures ranged from 1 to 5. Corresponding Bonferroni-adjusted alpha levels were used for these calculations. Results: Relative to that required for 1 test, the sample size increased by about 20% for 2 dependent variables and 30% for 3 dependent variables. Conclusion: The strategy described adjusts alpha for multiple primary efficacy measures and, in turn, modifies the sample size to maintain statistical power. Although the strategy is not novel, it is typically overlooked in psychopharmacology trials. The number of primary efficacy measures must be prespecified and carefully limited when a clinical trial protocol is prepared. If multiple tests are designated in the protocol, the alpha-level adjustment should be anticipated and incorporated in sample size calculations.

Abstract = {This study explores the use of artificial neural networks as a tool to assist child welfare and child protective service organizations in making more precise and more accurate risk assessment decisions on behalf of children and their families. An artificial neural network, a popular computational intelligence technique, was trained and tested with a backpropagation algorithm utilizing 1767 cases from the United States' Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect. The network was challenged to predict those children meeting the Harm Standard for abuse--the most severe classification of demonstrable harm from the case file data. Overall, the trained network was approximately 90% accurate in predicting children meeting, and not meeting the Harm Standard with relatively few false positives and false negatives. Neural networks along with other complimentary computing methodologies (e.g., fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms) are tools that could help to increase accuracy, reduce errors, and facilitate more effective decisions in child welfare and child protective service organizations.

Abstract = {Purpose: To determine the accuracy of a telephone-screening system to identify persons eligible for home-and community-based long-term care. Design and Methods: Data from Michigan telephone screens were compared to data from in-person assessments using the Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS-HC). Weighted kappa statistics measured the level of agreement between the two assessments. Results: Overall, recommendations based on the telephone screen produced a marginal match compared to recommendations based on in-person assessment. "False positives" (individuals scoring as more impaired on the telephone screen than in person) occurred in 27% of all cases, while "false negatives" (individuals scoring as less impaired on the telephone screen) only occurred among 6% of the callers. Neither individual screen questions, source of information, location of the individual, timing between screen and assessment, nor temporal changes accounted for mismatches. Telephone screens resulted in an 11% savings over the cost of providing in-person assessments to all program seekers. Implications: The telephone screen has utility as a broad targeting mechanism that allows agencies to avoid costly in-person assessments for all program seekers. Evidence does not support use of the telephone screen alone to determine either medical eligibility or a specific level of care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Suicide is a major public health problem. More than 90% of suicide victims have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, and most individuals who attempt suicide have a psychiatric illness. The most common psychiatric conditions associated with suicide or serious suicide attempts are mood disorders, but personality disorders, alcohol and substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia are also frequently associated with suicidal behaviour. The assessment of suicidal behaviour is the topic relevant to all clinicians not just mental health professionals. For example, in England, around 80% of patients with psychiatric disorders are treated in primary care. Suicide and suicidal behaviours are statistically rare, even in populations at risk. Clinicians deal with almost no other event as infrequent as suicide. Even under the best circumstances, the attempted prediction of an infrequent behaviour such as suicide inevitably generates a large number of false-positive and false-negative cases. In addition, the prediction of suicidal behaviour is based on inexact criteria that are relatively poor at predicting the behaviour of a given individual. Predicting suicide at the level of individual patient is not possible at the present time, even among high-risk groups of patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Current pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence in humans (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate) are meeting with only limited therapeutic success. The development of novel pharmacotherapies is urgently needed but is reliant upon the screening of large numbers of candidate "anticraving" drugs using appropriate animal models. The development of animal models is complex because (1) laboratory animals are often reluctant to consume large quantities of alcohol, (2) inducing a state of alcohol dependence, analogous to the human condition, may require many months of alcohol exposure, (3) concluding that a given drug selectively reduces alcohol craving requires very carefully controlled experiments, and (4) false positives and false negatives may result from the sometimes distinct physiology and psychology of the alcohol-addicted human and rat. To address some of these problems, our laboratory has recently developed the "beer model" of alcohol dependence and craving. Rats, like humans, have a prodigious appetite for beer and will drink much more beer than equivalent ethanol solutions in water. Beer consumption in rats leads to clear signs of intoxication, anxiety reduction, and signs of withdrawal when beer access is suddenly denied. We have found that beer craving in rats is selectively reduced by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716 and the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. Combining these two drugs appears to have a synergistic anticraving effect. Other promising pharmacotherapies for the future are discussed.

Participants in Experiment 1 received different sets of instructions that emphasized the negative consequence of either misses or false alarms. Results showed no changes in false recognition when the focus was on false alarm avoidance. In Experiment 2, the experimental groups studied the target words, whereas the control groups did not see any of the target words during the study phase. Both groups were also told that the probability of target words appearing in the recognition test was either one third or two thirds. Changes in the instructions did not affect performance of the experimental group, but had a large effect on performance of the control groups.

Abstract = {How to find and detect novel or unknown network attacks is one of the most important objectives in current intrusion detection systems. In this paper, a rule evolution approach based on Genetic Programming (GP) for detecting novel attacks on networks is presented and four genetic operators, namely reproduction, mutation, crossover, and dropping condition operators, are used to evolve new rules. New rules are used to detect novel or known network attacks. A training and testing dataset proposed by DARPA is used to evolve and evaluate these new rules. The proof of concept implementation shows that a rule generated by GP has a low false positive rate (FPR), a low false negative rate and a high rate of detecting unknown attacks. Moreover, the rule base composed of new rules has high detection rate with low FPR. An alternative to the DARPA evaluation approach is also investigated.

Abstract = {Background: There is evidence that schooling can influence performance in cognitive assessement tests. In developing countries, formal education is limited for most people. The use of tests such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), could have an adverse effect on the evaluation of illiterate and low education individuals. Objective: To propose a new version of MMSE as a screening test to assess illiterate and low education people. Method: A study was carried out enrolling 232 individuals, aged 60 or more of low and middle socio-economic classes. Three groups were studied: Illiterate; 1-4 schooling years; 5-8 schooling years. The new version (MMSE-mo) consisted of modifications in copy and calculation items of the adapted MMSE (MMSE-ad) to Portuguese language. The maximum possible score was the same in the two versions: total, 30; copy, 1 and calculation, 5. Results: In the total test score ANOVA detected main effects for education and test, as well as an interaction between these factors: higher schooling individuals performed better than lower schooling ones in both test versions; scores in MMSE-mo were higher than in MMSE-ad in every schooling group. Conclusion: Higher schooling levels improve the performance in both test versions, the copy and calculation items contributing to this improvement. This might depend on cultural factors.

Abstract = {This study employs classification tree analysis (CTA) to address whether 3 groups of violent offenders have similar or different risk factors for violent recidivism while on probation. A sample of 1,344 violent offenders on probation was classified as generalized aggressors (N=302), family only aggressors (N=321), or nonfamily only aggressors (N=717). The strongest predictor of violent recidivism while on probation was whether the offender was a generalized aggressor or not, with generalized aggressors more likely to be arrested for new violent crimes. Prior arrests for violent crimes predicted violent recidivism of generalized aggressors, but did not significantly predict violent recidivism of family only and nonfamily only aggressors. For generalized aggressors and family only batterers, treatment noncompliance was an important risk predictor of violent recidivism. CTA compared to logistic regression classified a higher percentage of cases into low-risk and high-risk groups, provided higher improvement in classification accuracy of violent recidivists beyond chance performance, and provided a better balance of false positives and false negatives. The implications for the risk assessment and domestic violence literature are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {In prior studies, it was observed that patients with schizophrenia show abnormally high knowledge corruption (i.e., high-confident errors expressed as a percentage of all high-confident responses were increased for schizophrenic patients relative to controls). The authors examined the conditions under which excessive knowledge corruption occurred using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. Whereas knowledge corruption in schizophrenia was significantly greater for false-negative errors relative to controls, no group difference occurred for false-positive errors. The groups showed a comparable high degree of confidence for false-positive recognition of critical lure items. Similar to findings collected in elderly participants, patients, but not controls, showed a strong positive correlation between the number of recognized studied items and false-positive recognition of the critical lure.

Abstract = {An extensive body of data demonstrates that diverse groups of mycotoxins can alter the structure and function of the nervous system in a variety of ways with notable human health consequences. Myconeurotoxicity refers to any adverse effects of exposure to mycotoxins or byproducts of primary and secondary mold metabolism, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the structural or functional integrity of the developing or adult nervous system. Neuromycotoxic effects may involve a spectrum of biochemical, morphological, behavioral, and physiological abnormalities whose onset can vary from immediate to delayed action, following exposure to a mycotoxin, and whose duration may be transient or persistent and result in disability, while some may have life-threatening consequences. Myconeurotoxicity may result from effects of the mycotoxins acting directly on the elements of the nervous system or acting on other biological systems, which then adversely affect the nervous system. This paper reviews the application, effectiveness, and limitations of the electrophysiological diagnosis of myconeurotoxic effects of chronic environmental exposure to mycotoxins. The systemic targets of mycotoxic effects were reviewed for greater understanding as to why different neurophysiological test techniques have different levels of outcomes. Thus, nerve conduction velocity, sensory, motor, and evoked potentials, electroencephalographic techniques were evaluated using previously published papers and our clinical experience. Although, neuromycotoxic disorders can be established using clinical electrophysiological diagnosis, there is always the possibility of false positive and false negative results in some patients, which may be due to a multi-factorial etiopathogenesis of neuromycotoxicity. Detection of nervous system toxicity and other measures of toxicity could be achieved using a combination of these neurodiagnostic techniques.

Abstract = {The present study tested strategies to help older adults correct their context-induced biases. Two hundred and seventy-two young and older adults participated in this study. Participants read vignettes about two target persons, with true statements printed in black and false statements (either positive or negative trait information) printed in red. Participants in the no-strategy condition were asked to rate the target persons on the relevant trait scales immediately after reading the vignettes. Participants in the feedback condition took a traditional source memory test and received feedback of correct sources of true and false statements. For the participants in the next two conditions, accountability was induced either before or after they encoded information about the target persons. It was found that the feedback manipulation helped older adults correct their context-induced biases. In addition, accountability induced before encoding helped older adults reduce their context-induced biases, whereas accountability induced after encoding did not help.

Abstract = {Offers an explanation for the misclassification of cervical smears in false-negative diagnoses, by an experienced cytopathologist engaged in the screening of such smears for cervical cancer, in a women's hospital in England. Spontaneous fluctuation in sensitivity and assimilation to the previous response may be possible explanations of fluctuations in the probability of detection (C. I. Howarth & M. G. Bulmer, 1956). Prior expectations also influences false-negative diagnoses. A reanalysis of the smears revealed 487 new "positives," and showed that diagnostic criteria vary between pathologists. In the absence of internal criteria, the cytopathologist would have to resort to comparing smears with their predecessors, for an absolute judgment. More detailed and accurate classification, and rechecking and re-examination of smears, are suggested for the prevention of systematic misdiagnosis.

Abstract = {Targeted programs designed to prevent conduct problems in childhood and adolescence rely on screening systems to identify high-risk individuals. This study examines the proximal usefulness of a multiple-gating approach to screening, using teacher and parent ratings in a 2-step procedure with a sample of 382 kindergarten children. The study explored differences in the accuracy of the 2 steps of screening information and whether parents' reports of parenting practices augments the prediction of negative outcomes. The 2-step screening system was found to effectively predict negative behavior outcomes over 1 year later, although some false-positive and false-negative predictions were evident. The Parenting Practices Screen did not substantially add to prediction accuracy. The discussion emphasizes the potential contributions and problems of using screening measures.

Positive symptom (particularly anxiety and depression) scores and general psychopathology scores were more severe in the dissociative identity group than in the norms for schizophrenia, while negative symptoms were more severe in schizophrenia.

Abstract = {In studies of clinical depression, individuals who demonstrate elevated levels of symptoms but do not meet interview-based diagnostic criteria are typically labeled as false positive and eliminated from further consideration. However, the implicit assumption that false-positive participants differ in important ways from true-positive (i.e., diagnosed) participants has not been tested systematically. This study compared the functioning of true-positive, false-positive, and true-negative adolescents on clinical and psychosocial functioning. Although the false-positive participants manifested higher levels of current and future psychopathology than did the true-negative participants, they did not differ significantly from the true-positive participants on most of the measures of psychosocial dysfunction. "False positive," therefore, is not a benign condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

In line with past research showing increased prejudice among individuals whose positive self-image has been threatened, certain discriminatory behaviors were observed among threatened participants. Participants first received positive or negative false feedback on an intelligence task. Next, participants expected to interact with a target belonging to a minority or to their own (majority) group. Participants who received negative feedback and thus experienced a threat to the self, displayed more avoidance behavior towards the minority target compared to participants in the other groups. No discrimination was observed in other measures (eg., time spent with the target).

Abstract = {Using the "remember-know" procedure to assess recognition memory, previous studies yielded evidence of impaired recollection but intact familiarity in schizophrenia patients. However, so far, the recognition memory performance of schizophrenia patients has not yet been analysed using the dual-process signal detection model (DPSD) by Yonelinas [Yonelinas, A. P. (2001). Components of episodic memory: The contribution of recollection and familiarity. Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences, 356(1413), 1363-1374], which accurately accounts for response and memory bias. Also, clinical symptoms have not yet been taken into account. Based on findings from neuropsychological and neurobiological research we hypothesized that high negative symptoms might be associated with a profile of impaired recollection and spared familiarity. The recognition memory performance of 22 schizophrenia patients scoring higher or lower on the negative symptoms subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was assessed by means of a word list discrimination task. Following the rationale of the dual-process signal detection model, estimates of recollection and familiarity were derived. The recollection estimate, derived by the DPSD model, was lower in patients with more severe negative symptomatology compared with both the patients with lower negative symptoms scores and healthy individuals. Familiarity was not affected if IQ was partialled out. Furthermore, the results yielded increased false alarm rates in patients with negative schizophrenia. The findings confirm an association of negative symptoms and recollection impairment in schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Quantitative head impulse test (HIT) measures the gain of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during head rotation as the ratio of eye to head acceleration. Bedside HIT identifies subsequent catch-up saccades after the head rotation as indirect signs of VOR deficit. Objective: To determine the VOR deficit and catch-up saccade characteristics in unilateral vestibular disease in response to HIT of varying accelerations. Methods: Eye and head rotations were measured with search coils during manually applied horizontal HITs of varying accelerations in patients after vestibular neuritis (VN, n = 13) and unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD, n = 15) compared to normal subjects (n = 12). Results: Normal VOR gain was close to unity and symmetric over the entire head-acceleration range. Patients with VN and UVD showed VOR gain asymmetry, with larger ipsilesional than contralesional deficits. As accelerations increased from 750 to 6,000 °/sec², ipsilesional gains decreased from 0.59 to 0.29 in VN and from 0.47 to 0.13 in UVD producing increasing asymmetry. Initial catch-up saccades can occur during or after head rotation. Covert saccades during head rotation are most likely imperceptible, while overt saccades after head rotation are detectable by clinicians. With increasing acceleration, the amplitude of overt saccades in patients became larger; however, initial covert saccades also became increasingly common, occurring in up to about 70% of trials. Conclusions: Head impulse test (HIT) with high acceleration reveals vestibulo-ocular reflex deficits better and elicits larger overt catch-up saccades in unilateral vestibular patients. Covert saccades during head rotation, however, occur more frequently with higher acceleration and may be missed by clinicians. To avoid false-negative results, bedside HIT should be repeated to improve chances of detection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses alfuzosin as an example of a drug having QT risk in humans that was not detected in nonclinical studies. FDA approval required a thorough clinical QT study (TCQS) that was weakly positive at high doses. The FDA has used the clinical/nonclinical discordance as a basis for mandatory TCQS, and this requirement has serious consequences for drug development. For this reason, we re-examined whether nonclinical signals of QT risk for alfuzosin were truly absent. Alfuzosin significantly prolonged action potential duration (APD)₆₀ in rabbit Purkinje fibers (p < 0.05) and QT in isolated rabbit hearts (p < 0.05) at the clinically relevant concentration of 300 nM. In man, the QT interval corrected with Fridericia's formula increased 7.7 ms, which exceeds the 5.0-ms threshold for a positive TCQS. Effects on hKv11.1, hKv4.3, and hKv7.1/hKCNE1 potassium currents and calcium current were not involved. At 300 nM, ∼30 × Cmax, alfuzosin significantly increased whole-cell peak sodium (hNav1.5) current (p < 0.05), increased the probability of late hNav1.5 single-channel openings, and significantly shortened the slow time constant for recovery from inactivation. Alfuzosin also increased hNav1.5 burst duration and number of openings per burst between 2- and 3-fold. Alfuzosin is a rare example of a non-antiarrhythmic drug that delays cardiac repolarization not by blocking hKv11.1 potassium current, but by increasing sodium current. Nonclinical studies clearly show that alfuzosin increases plateau potential and prolongs APD and QT, consistent with QT prolongation in man. The results challenge the FDA grounds for the absolute primacy of TCQS based on the claim of a false-negative, nonclinical study on alfuzosin.

Abstract = {Objective: To meet diagnostic needs of dementia, a new care programme was implemented in the county of Kalmar, Sweden. The objective of the study was to analyse whether the programme could identify and diagnose the estimated number of new cases. Methods: A long-term follow up study on all new patients referred to primary and specialist care between 1999 and 2005 for dementia evaluation. Results: Based on epidemiological data, 153 new cases per year were expected. Using the programme, an average of 127 cases was identified in primary healthcare and 22 at specialist level. Although the number of false-negative cases is not known, it may be concluded that most of the new cases with dementia were identified. The proportion of cases identified doubled after implementing the programme. The programme was implemented within an unchanged budget. Conclusion: The programme may be of value for diagnosis and management of demented patients in primary healthcare. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Substance use is a significant problem for people with schizophrenia although there has been little investigation of assessment methods for this population. General findings suggest that self report methods may have advantages over biochemical methods. We investigated the relationship between self report methods of substance use assessment TLFB (Time Line Follow Back) and detection from hair analysis in people dually diagnosed with psychosis and substance misuse problems. Participants with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia and substance abuse or dependence taking part in a trial of psychological therapy were recruited. Ninety two of the participants were male, the mean age was 31 years (SD 10 years) and all were of white European ethnicity. As a result, hair and TLFB assessment were available on 28 participants (78%). Self report of illicit substance use using TLFB methodology resulted in greater endorsement of use of amphetamines and cannabis than that detected using hair analysis. The findings for cannabis and amphetamines, however, suggest that although hair analysis is quite specific in detecting substances, it lacks sensitivity and this makes it likely to result in a high rate of false negatives. This may be a more useful function in clinical practice and research as it allows not only the detection of substance use with good sensitivity but will facilitate clinicians and researchers to explore and assess the nature of the substance use in greater detail.

Abstract = {As part of a larger study comparing the sensitivity of information processing tasks (IPTs) and neuropsychological instruments to detect early HIV-related cognitive decrements, 129 HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults completed a vigilance task and a battery of neuropsychological tests to identify factors that influenced performance on IPTs. 18 Ss tested positive for recreational drugs, and 16 of these Ss had elevated false alarm rates on the vigilance task. Another 45 Ss who tested negative for recreational drugs also had elevated false alarm rates. Neuropsychological measures of premorbid functioning, attention, speed of information processing, and manual dexterity were lower in the high false alarm Ss than in the remaining 66 drug-negative, low false alarm Ss. The vigilance task may be a sensitive and efficient screening tool for recreational drug use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Explored agreement between alcoholism diagnoses obtained by a best-estimate (BE) procedure vs those obtained through family history (FH). Participants were 1,459 1st-degree relatives (aged 16 yrs and older) of either schizophrenic Ss, Ss with affective disorders, or matched community controls. The 2 types of error that were distinguished included false-negative FHs and false-positive FHs. The risk of false-negative FHs was increased by young age of S and male gender of the informant, and decreased by a history of previous hospitalization of S. Risk for false-positive FHs was increased by older age of S, male gender of S, female gender of the informant, and informant's diagnosis of alcoholism. Comorbid diagnosis of nonaffective psychosis increased the risk of both types of error. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the ability of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to detect varying levels and types of cognitive impairment in 79 psychogeriatric patients (aged 60+ yrs). There were significant limitations in the MMSE's ability to detect dementia. High false negative rates were obtained for detection of dementia, nonspecific cognitive impairment, and specific cognitive impairments. When milder cases were included, the high false negative rates were further increased. These limitations suggest that certain types of cognitive impairment may be overlooked if the MMSE is relied on as a definitive screening tool.

Abstract = {Little research has evaluated the validity of the Coping Deficit Index (CDI) of the Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS). Because the CS Depression Index (DEPI) has frequently been found to yield false negatives, the CDI has been proposed as an alternative means of assessing social coping skills that may relate to depression. This study examined potential correlates of the CDI using the Personality Inventory for Children-Second Edition (PIC-2). Sixty five children and adolescents were assessed with the Rorschach CS and the PIC-2. None of the PIC-2 clinical scales or subscales measuring withdrawal or social skills predicted a positive CDI, and none of the depression-related PIC-2 scales predicted a positive CDI or DEPI. The only significant relationship found was a negative relationship between the CDI and a PIC-2 subscale measuring sleep problems and preoccupation with death. Implications of these findings for clinicians and further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Early symptoms of delirium often go unnoticed. The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) is a recently developed short, accurate and sensitive 24-h screening instrument. The Nu-DESC is more sensitive than the instrument from which it was derived, the Confusion Rating Scale (CRS). This study examined the impact on delirium detection of using the Nu-DESC over the CRS in 134 consecutive oncology patients. Expected false-negative rate (FNR) reductions at different delirium prevalence rates when using the Nu-DESC compared to the CRS and the number needed to screen (NNS) by the Nu-DESC were calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to study Nu-DESC-CRS divergences in delirium status and length of delirium-free survival. Ninety-nine patients were negative for delirium according to both tests. Of the remaining 35 patients, 16 had identical Nu-DESC-CRS delirium status and delirium-free survival, whereas 19 were detected later by the CRS (mean, 4.8 days). Among the 19 patients, 6 were still CRS negative upon hospital discharge. Integrating a continuous and sensitive delirium assessment instrument into usual care can facilitate its recognition, since more cases of delirium are diagnosed and patients are detected earlier.

Abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and accuracy of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure in vulvar cancer. Methods: From April 2004 to September 2006, all patients with vulvar cancer, clinical stages I and II, underwent SLN detection, followed by a complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Demographic, surgical, and pathologic data on all patients were prospectively entered in a database. Results: Forty-two patients underwent the SLN procedure. One patient was excluded from further analysis due to metastases to the vulva. The detection rate for at least 1 SLN per patient was 95%, with bilateral SLNs detected in 46% of patients. There was a trend toward improved ability to detect bilateral SLNs and proximity of the cancer to the midline (r = 0.996; P = .057). No contralateral SLNs were identified in patients with lateral vulvar lesions (>1 cm from the midline). For ‘close-to-midline’ (≤1 cm from the midline) lesions, SLNs were detected in 93% of ipsilateral groins and bilateral SLNs were found in 46% of patients, whereas lesions abutting the midline had unilateral and bilateral SLN detected in 100% and 93%, respectively. Sixteen of 41 patients (39%) and 18 of 68 groins (26%) revealed metastatic disease in the lymph nodes; all were correctly identified by the SLN procedure. There were no false-negative SLN results. Conclusions: SLN dissection is feasible and safe to perform in vulvar cancer. The ability to identify bilateral sentinel inguinal lymph nodes appears to be related to the proximity of the vulvar cancer to the midline.

Abstract = {Purpose: Detailed information about the comparison question test (CQT) and possible countermeasures are now available on the Internet. This study examined whether the provision of such information would affect the validity of the Test for Espionage and Sabotage, a directed lie variant of the CQT. Method: Forty participants were divided into four equal groups: guilty, guilty informed, innocent, and innocent informed. During a first appointment, participants either did or did not commit a mock crime: then some were provided with a book containing detailed information on the CQT, including possible countermeasures. After 1 week with the book, all participants were administered a CQT during their second appointment. Following the polygraph, participants responded to a questionnaire that asked them about their behaviour and perceptions during their examination. Results: There were no significant effects of providing information on the validity of the CQT. However, the reported use of countermeasures was associated with a lower probability of truthfulness. Results of the debriefing questionnaire were found to support predictions made by the theory of the CQT. Conclusions: Concerns that readily available information will enable guilty individuals to produce false-negative errors seem unfounded. Moreover, the results actually indicate that the use of countermeasures was associated with a lower probability of truthfulness, which was exactly the opposite outcome predicted by the CQT critics.

Abstract = {The cardiovascular pre-participation screening proposal for young competitive athletes has the potential to save young lives. This study aimed to identify individuals at risk for potentially lethal cardiovascular diseases in athletes before competition. Between June 2005 and July 2005, 351 (170 male and 181 female) elite Chinese athletes from 21 sports were profiled. The 12-lead electrocardiogram and echocardiography were employed to evaluate cardiovascular diseases. The vast majority had no definitive evidence of cardiovascular disease. However, abnormal ECGs were identified in 16 athletes (4.5%), including 4 with distinctly abnormal and 12 with mildly abnormal patterns. Only 13 athletes (3.7%) had echocardiographic evidence of relatively mild valve regurgitation that had not been previously suspected. In three athletes with relatively mild ventricular septal hypertrophy (13-14 mm), it was not possible to discern with absolute certainty whether the wall thickening was a manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or secondary to athletic conditioning ("athlete heart"). This screening protocol identified no athletes with definite evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Marfan's syndrome or other cardiovascular diseases that convey a significant potential risk for sudden death or disease progression during athletic activity. This is largely due to the relative low prevalence of conditions resulting in sudden cardiac death in young athletes and high false positive/negative rates in the tests used as part of the screening process (due to a large overlap between cardiovascular changes due to pathology and those due to intense training).

Abstract = {Guidelines for forensic interviews of children in sexual abuse cases recommend from a legal perspective enhancing evidence in free narrative where the interviewer employs open-ended questions. The findings concerning children's abilities to report autobiographic memories of stressful events and resist misleading suggestions are inconsistent. The article starts by assuming that children need assistance in talking about their experiences of severe sexual abuse. This highlights the risk of false negatives arising in such cases, Forensic interviews are communication situations influenced by multidisciplinary knowledge. Cognitive developmental theory, trauma, attachment, and dialogical communication theory constitute the framework for understanding them. A methodological approach is briefly described in which children are encouraged to provide free narratives about sexual abuse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Background: It is commonly believed that there exists a relationship between the outcome of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) test, the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (DEX/CRH) test and stressful life events (SLEs) in major depressive disorder. Objective: SLEs influence the TRH and DEX/CRH tests in major depressive disorder when administered at the time of admission and improvement. Methods: The TRH and DEX/CRH tests were administered to patients hospitalized for major depressive disorders - on the 4th through the 7th hospital day and at the time of improvement. We measured ΔMAX TSH, ΔMAX ACTH, ACTH AUC, ΔMAX cortisol, cortisol AUC, ΔMAX ACTH/ΔMAX TSH and ΔMAX cortisol/ΔMAX TSH. Results: SLEs were significantly negatively associated with ΔMAX ACTH, ACTH AUC and cortisol AUC at the time of admission. However, these relationships lost significance at the time of improvement. The sample (41 patients at the time of admission, 18 patients at the time of improvement) was relatively small, which may have contributed to false-negative results. Conclusion: SLEs may be negatively associated with the outcome of the DEX/CRH tests in major depressive disorder. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the DEX/CRH test was modulated by SLEs.

Abstract = {Objective: Exploring the epidemiological state of pervasive developmental disorder in 2-6 year-old children in Beijing. Methods: A total of 21866 children aged 2-6 year-old were recruited from permanent residents of Beijing by 2-phase cluster sampling. The Clancy Autism Behavior Scale was used for screening. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale and DSM-IV were used for diagnosis. Results: 16 children were diagnosed as pervasive developmental disorder (14 with autistic disorder, 1 with atypical autistic disorder, 1 with Rett syndrome). The false negative rate was 0.80%. The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder was 0.73%, the adjusted prevalence was 1.53%, the average annual detective rate was 0.11%. The prevalence rate had no difference in distribution between urban-rural, among different age groups, sex and nations (χ² = 0.11 ∼ 1.85, P = 0.739-0.173). The low family income was related to high prevalence significantly (tendency χ² = 4.70, P = 0.030). 25% children with pervasive developmental disorder had not been identified by parents or had not been to clinics. 80% children with pervasive developmental disorder had not get intervention. All children had demand to get intervention. Conclusions: The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder in 2-6 year-old children in Beijing was not low. Low family income is the risk factor. The rate of intervention was low. The government should pay close attention to the children with pervasive developmental disorder and their needs.

Abstract = {Objectives: This study assessed the relationship between Eyewitness Accuracy regarding a person met under conditions of high stress and performance on a standardized, neutral test of memory for human faces. Method: Fifty-three U.S. Army personnel were exposed to interrogation stress. Forty-eight hours later, participants were administered the Weschler Face Test and then asked to identify the one interrogator who they had encountered 48 h earlier. Results: A significant positive relationship was observed between performance on the Weschler Face Test and performance on the Eyewitness task. Inaccurate eyewitnesses exhibited more False Negative errors when performing the Weschler Face Test. Discussion: Trait ability to remember human faces may be related to how accurately people recall faces that are associated with highly emotional circumstances.

Abstract = {Background: A recent series of studies has questioned DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for hypomania, suggesting that overactivity (increased goal-directed activity) should have priority over mood change as stem criterion. Angst has suggested new criteria for hypomania, giving priority to overactivity. Study aim was to test the validity of Angst's diagnostic criteria for hypomania. Methods: A consecutive sample of remitted 213 DSM-IV bipolar-II disorder (BP-II) and major depressive disorder (MDD) outpatients were re-diagnosed, during a follow-up visit, by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (yes/no structured questions on hypomanic symptoms, skip-out instruction of stem question on mood change not followed, in order to assess all past hypomanic symptoms), by a mood disorder specialist psychiatrist in a private practice. Angst's stem diagnostic criteria for hypomania were tested versus DSM-IV hypomania: I) overactivity plus at least 3 of the 7 DSM-IV hypomanic symptoms 2) overactivity plus at least 2 of the 7 DSM-IV hypomanic symptoms. Results: DSM-IV criteria for hypomania were met by 137 patients, overactivity plus 2/7 was met by 146 patients, and overactivity plus 3/7 was met by 135 patients. Of the patients with overactivity plus 2/7, 83.5% also met DSM-IV criteria for hypomania, and of the patients with overactivity plus 3/7 86.6% also met DSM-IV criteria for hypomania. Logistic regression of DSM-IV hypomania versus overactivity plus 2/7 found odds ratio (OR) = 17.6, and versus overactivity plus 3/7 found OR = 18.8. Comparisons between DSM-IV hypomania and Angst's criteria for hypomania showed that there were no significant differences on age, gender, symptom structure of hypomania, number of episodes, episodes duration, and episodes level of functioning. Associations (ORs) between the stem criterion of each definition of hypomania and hypomanic symptoms were often strong. DSM-IV hypomania stem criterion was closely associated with overactivity (OR = 15.4), and Angst's hypomania stem criteria were closely associated with mood change (OR = 7.6 for overactivity plus 2/7, OR = 14.3 for overactivity plus 3/7). Conclusions: Results support Angst's criteria for hypomania based on overactivity (overactivity plus 3/7 seems more supported). These criteria do not seem to lead to overdiagnosing hypomania. Previous studies supported the upgrading of overactivity among DSM-IV hypomanic symptoms. Angst's diagnostic criteria may positively impact the treatment of depression. It has been shown that focusing the probing for history of hypomania more on overactivity than on mood change reduces the false-negative BP-II. By using Angst' criteria for hypomania, clinicians may reduce the current high misdiagnosis of BP-II as MDD and the related mistreatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A television content analysis and survey of 419 community respondents supports the hypothesis that media stereotypes affect public attitudes toward mental health issues. A content analysis of network, prime-time television demonstrates that portrayals are violent, false, and negative. The mentally disordered are portrayed as 10 times more likely to be a violent criminal than nonmentally disordered television characters. A survey demonstrates that as television viewing increases so does the belief among viewers that locating mental health services in residential neighborhoods will endanger the residents. Viewers who watch television news are less likely to support living next to someone who is mentally ill.

Abstract = {Investigated the potential problem of false negatives (i.e., people with an attitude who decline to express an opinion), rather than the more commonly investigated nonattitudes (i.e., people expressing opinions while lacking an underlying attitude) or false positives. Using a survey (N = 1,568) on nuclear power from Sweden, the authors explored whether people who answer "don't know" but are induced subsequently to give an opinion really have attitudes. The attitudes that these people expressed on follow-up questions predicted behavior to a significant extent. This implies that the usual don't know category includes some false negatives (i.e., people who really have attitudes but refrain, at least initially, from expressing them).

Methods are described for estimating the false-negative and false-positive rates resulting from measurement error for a mastery examination. These rates and the reliabilities of the pass-fail decisions based on a recently adopted standard-setting procedure are reported for data for 6 classes of senior medical students. The methods for determining the false-negative rate, in particular, provided valuable information for faculty about the effectiveness of the new standard-setting procedure for minimizing false-negative decisions for an SP-based examination.

SP and recognition memory for positive, neutral, and negative words were tested in 10 depressed Ss and 10 matched controls. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between primes and target strings was manipulated to distinguish between automatic and controlled routes for the spread of activation. In unprimed lexical decision, Ss were slower to respond to neutral than to emotional words at the short SOA. However, Ss also showed enhanced automatic priming to neutral words, and reduced priming to emotional words. On recognition memory, Ss committed most false positive responses to negative words, whereas controls committed most false positives to positive words.

Abstract = {Little is known on the diagnostic characteristics of brief questionnaires on alcohol drinking behaviors. This report investigates the determinants of three short alcohol questionnaires and investigates their diagnostic utility as screening tools for alcohol-related problems in a general population from The Netherlands. This report uses cross-sectional data obtained in the year 2000 from 36-year-old healthy male (N=166) and female (N=165) volunteers who reported to drink alcohol at least occasionally. Since they were 13-years-old these volunteers have been members of the Amsterdam Growth And Health Longitudinal Study, which started as a school-based study in 1977. Among many other variables, quantity-frequency questions (QF), the CAGE questionnaire, and a question on the highest number of alcoholic units consumed on one occasion during the previous month (MAX) were asked. The sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa, and diagnostic odds ratio of QF, CAGE, MAX, and combinations of these three brief questionnaires were calculated using a 7-item questionnaire on alcohol-related problems as reference. Both in women and men, the prevalence of most alcohol-related problems and of a high QF, CAGE, and MAX was low. QF, CAGE, and MAX, as well as all possible combinations of the three questionnaires, were poor in detecting last-year alcohol-related problems. The CAGE appeared to perform worse than the even shorter and easier-to-interpret QF and MAX. In this healthy population of 36-year-old men and women, using the QF, MAX, and especially the CAGE questionnaire as screening instruments for alcohol-related problems resulted in many false positive and false negative classifications.

Abstract = {The Addenbrooke s Cognitive Examination (ACE) is a brief 'bedside' cognitive assessment scale reported to be useful for the early diagnosis of dementia and the differentiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from frontotemporal dementia. Method: Of 285 patients assessed with the ACE over the study period, 23 (M:F=13:10) had more than one assessment. Initial diagnoses were MCI (15), probable AD (5), probable vascular dementia (1), circumscribed amnesia secondary to profound hypoglycaemia in an insulin-dependent diabetic (1). Results: Based on patient and caregiver report and clinical judgement, 16 patients declined over the follow-up period, six remained static, and one improved. Although numbers are small, with consequent uncertainty about psychometric parameter estimates, nonetheless this pragmatic study suggests ACE is responsive to, and hence of value in longitudinal tracking of, cognitive change, and in reaching a diagnosis of dementia. Depending on whether the individual clinician is more anxious to avoid false positive or false negative diagnoses, ACE cutoff may be set lower or higher accordingly.

It has been employed in a wide range of circumstances, though researchers have sometimes employed real money reinforcers instead of the facsimile (or 'monopoly'-type) money used by Bechara et al.

There were no significant differences between the two conditions, though the Facsimile Money condition produced a greater range (and a higher standard deviation) than the Real Money condition. This finding is especially important when considering the Gambling Task as a tool in clinical neuropsychology where there are risks, at the individual subject level, of both false positive and false negative classification errors.

Abstract = {In the mirror effect, there are fewer false negatives (misses) and false positives (false alarms) for rare (low-frequency) words than for common (high-frequency) words. In the spacing effect, recognition accuracy is positively related to the interval (spacing or lag) between two presentations of an item. These effects are related in that they are both manifestations of a leapfrog effect (a weaker item jumps over a stronger item). They seem to be puzzles for traditional strength theory and at least some current global-matching models. A computational strength-based model (EICL) is proposed that incorporates excitation, inhibition, and a closed-loop learning algorithm. The model consists of three nonlinear coupled stochastic difference equations, one each for excitation (x), inhibition (y), and context (z). Strength is the algebraic sum (i.e., s = x - y + z). These equations are used to form a toy lexicon that serves as a basis for the experimental manipulations. The model can simulate the mirror effect forcedchoice inequalities and the spacing effect for single-item recognition, all parameters are random variables, and the same parameter values are used for both the mirror and the spacing effects. No parameter values varied with the independent... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The present study investigated developmental trends in response inhibition and preparation by studying behavior and event-related brain activity in a cued go/nogo task, administered to nine-year-old children and young adults. Hits, false alarms, inattention, and impulsivity scores and ERP measures of inhibition (fronto-central nogo-N2 and P3), target selection (parietal go-nogo P3 difference), and response preparation (contingent negative variation; CNV) were collected. Higher false alarm and impulsivity scores and the absence of the fronto-central nogo P3 all suggest a developmental lag in response inhibition in children. A developmental lag in sustained attention processes was suggested by worse target detection and larger parietal target/nontarget P3 effects in children. Cue orientation and response preparation processes were respectively measured by early and late CNV activity. Children displayed smaller early CNV amplitudes at fronto-central locations, but mature late CNV. The smaller early CNV activity might indicate inefficient cue-orientation processes caused by incomplete frontal lobe development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Kiechel (1996) falsely accused students of causing a computer crash and found that 69% of them were willing to sign a false confession, 28% internalized guilt, and 9% confabulated details to support their false beliefs. The authors interpreted these results to mean that false confessions can be easily elicited. However, in their study, false confessions were explicitly not associated with negative consequences. This study examined whether false incriminating evidence may elicit false confessions in 34 female undergraduates (aged 18-22 yrs) when such confessions are explicitly associated with financial loss. The authors also explored whether individual differences in compliance, suggestibility, fantasy-proneness, dissociation, and cognitive failures are related to false confessions. Methods were largely replicated from Kassin and Kiechel's study. Data indicate that the large majority of participants (82%) were willing to sign a false confession. In about half of the participants, false confessions were accompanied by internalization and confabulation. There was no evidence that individual differences modulate participants' susceptibility to false confessions. Taken together, this study replicates previous findings of Kassin and Kiechel.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by John J. Shea (see record [rid]2011-18369-001[/rid]). The concepts of modern human behavior and/or behavioral modernity are loaded with overtones of evolutionary destiny. The call for a shift away from such terms is overdue, and this one is to be welcomed. Shea’s article shows us how the quest for "modernity" brings little but harm to the study of human evolution, and he offers us a possibly viable alternative approach for the systematic analysis of Paleolithic behavior. Although more than willing to see a sea change in both the concepts and its terminology, I have to wonder if behavioral variability will be the panacea that Shea promises. The principal challenge to this alternative approach will be methodological: how is "behavioral variability" to be measured? Why would this concept not be affected by all the same suspects that also plague behavioral modernity? To measure variability, some sort of units of input will have to be counted; once again it will be the researcher who decides which units are important enough to be included. This sounds suspiciously like the dreaded “trait list” so maligned by Shea. Preservation issues and sampling bias will continue to limit the categories of behavior that can be reached in the material record. The frequency and distribution of such behaviors, all required for a robust measure of variability, will continue to be haunted by the same false negatives he reviews here.

Abstract = {In a recent study of treatment for panic disorder in primary care, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-Auto) was used to provide psychiatric diagnoses. However, during and after data collection, it was discovered that the CIDI appeared to place, or fail to place, a substantial number of people into diagnostic categories in ways that conflicted with the investigators' clinical experience. The wording of questions in the panic module, coupled with a lack of structured follow-up probes, resulted in apparent false negatives for panic disorder. Moreover, patients who would otherwise meet criteria for panic disorder or social phobia did not receive a diagnosis based on rules that may be discordant with clinical practice and, at times, the design of the DSM-IV. For this study, changes were made to the interview, including additional probes for the panic disorder module and modification of the decision rules used to assign or rule out diagnoses of panic disorder and social phobia. The changes resulted in greater inclusion of patients in the panic disorder and social phobia diagnostic categories and we argue that these changes to the CIDI-Auto increase the clinical validity of this instrument. We did not examine the false positive rate for the unmodified or modified CIDI, but this is an important issue that needs to be evaluated in future research.

Abstract = {Early clinical symptoms of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). False negative results in autopsy-proven, sporadic CJD cases, as well as false positive results in several other disorders including AD and FTD showing high CSF tau protein levels, limit the potential of this marker. Due to neuronal lysis the cytosolic fraction of total tau containing phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated isoforms is partially liberated into the CSF. Since hyperphosphorylation of tau may specifically occur in neurodegenerative diseases associated with neurofibrillary changes, we hypothesized that the phospho-tau (P-tau)/total tau ratio in CSF may be a useful marker to discriminate CJD from other neurodegenerative disorders. The P-tau/total tau ratio discriminated patients with CJD from all other neuro-degenerative disorders including patients with AD and FTD without any overlap. Although the results have to be confirmed in a larger sample, the preliminary data suggest that simultaneous measurement of total tau and P-tau in CSF may be useful to identify patients with CJD.

Abstract = {When assessing the recidivism risk of previously convicted sex offenders, the relevant ethical standards and practice guidelines obligate psychologists to acknowledge numerous limits related to their data and conclusions. For the actuarial instruments used in these assessments, the highest rates of classification accuracy are associated with greater specificity compared with sensitivity. Selecting cut-off scores to maximize sensitivity results in an inordinate frequency of false positive classifications. Attempts at maximizing specificity create an undesirable frequency of false negative classifications. Unfortunately, adjusted actuarial assessment cannot remedy these problems created by the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff.As an unstandardized procedure, the accuracy of adjusted actuarial assessment is severely limited. Consequently, civil proceedings for previously convicted sexual offenders rely on assessments of very limited accuracy. Undertaking these assessments, therefore, may be inconsistent with relevant ethical standards and practice guidelines. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The titles of Tables 1 and 4 should read as follows: Table 1. Characterisitics of the Selected Sample and the Nonselected Girls, Table 4. Receiver Operating Characteristics Results of TOCA-R Predicting a Violent Arrest in Girls. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2005-08184-010[/rid].) Objective: To evaluate the utility of a teacher-rating instrument (Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Revised [TOCA-R]) of aggressive behavior during elementary school years in identifying girls at risk of later criminal court violence. Method: A community epidemiological sample of 845 urban public school girls was rated at six time points during elementary school regarding their level of aggressive/disruptive behavior (75% of whom were African American). Criminal violence was measured using juvenile court records. Logistic regression was used to study the strength of the association between early indicators of aggressive behavior and adolescent females' violent outcomes. An extension of the traditional receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to study the accuracy of identifying girls at risk of violence under three different screening and intervention scenarios. Results: For girls, teacher ratings of aggression were a strong and consistent predictor of later violence across grades 1-5 and were strongest in fifth grade. Three screening scenarios were compared to determine the optimal identification threshold. The screening scenario with a focus on minimizing false negatives yielded the highest value (K = 0.803). Conclusions: This study supports other studies indicating that early levels of aggressive behavior are strong and robust predictors of later violence among girls but are of limited utility in the early identification of girls at risk, especially when the focus is on reducing both false positives and negatives (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of the Eating Attitude Test (EAT) in identifying the presence and severity of eating pathology in male and female Omani urban adolescents and to establish cut-off scores that matched those of anorexia identified by gold standard interviews without fear of fatness criteria. Both females (n=126, mean age 15.29 yrs) and males (n=136, mean age 15.56 yrs) were screened using the Arabic version of the EAT-26 and interviewed using a semi-structured, Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) in order to investigate the relationship between false positives and false negatives at various EAT-26 cut-off points. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was calculated to discriminate the power of the EAT-26 for every possible threshold score. Results: The EAT-26 identified 29% of the subjects as probable anorexic cases as against 9.5% identified during the structured interview based on the anorexia gold standard (32% males and 68% females). The sensitivity and specificity of the EAT-26 were respectively 24% and 69.6%. When using the ROC curve, a cut-off score of 10 gave the best compromise between sensitivity (64%) and specificity (38%). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Surveys of public opinion indicate that people have high expectations for juries. When it comes to serious crimes, most people want errors of convicting the innocent (false positives) or acquitting the guilty (false negatives) to fall well below 10%. Using expected utility theory, Bayes' Theorem, signal detection theory, and empirical evidence from detection studies of medical decision making, eyewitness testimony, and weather forecasting, we argue that the frequency of mistakes probably far exceeds these "tolerable" levels. We are not arguing against the use of juries. Rather, we point out that a closer look at jury decisions reveals a serious gap between what we expect from juries and what probably occurs. When deciding issues of guilt and/or punishing convicted criminals, we as a society should recognize and acknowledge the abundance of error.

Abstract = {Notes that in spite of many false negatives and false positives quite familiar to the people of Nazi-dominated Europe, dark hair and eyes were salient among the physical stereotypes of Jews that the Nazis promulgated along with psychosocial ones. Many narratives of the Holocaust refer to someone surviving because he or she "did not look Jewish," and others being caught and killed because they did. A quantitative test of the validity and impact of this attribution showed that a higher proportion of Holocaust survivors than of a North American Jewish control group had light-colored hair, eyes, or both during the relevant period. The paper discusses possible reasons why these were survival characteristics under the conditions of the Holocaust, the possible short- and long-term effects of such selectivity, and implications for stereotyping in other situations of ethnic persecution and genocide.

Abstract = {Aimed to validate the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) as a screening instrument in a random sample of 184 prisoners (aged 18-60 yrs) on remand in Denmark. The overall performance of GHQ-28 as a screening device was rather poor using the normal cut-off point. The study supports the notion that there are problems in using questionnaires in prison populations. The main problem seemed to be simulation/aggravation rather than dissimulation as the issue of false positives by far exceeded the issue of false negatives. By increasing the cut-off point substantially better, psychometric properties are obtained in this prison population. With caution, the results may be extended to other self-report measures in prison populations: cut-off points must be increased among prisoners in order to obtain acceptable psychometric properties.

Abstract = {Evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a highly structured diagnostic interview in relation to a semi-structured diagnostic procedure. This study compared the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) in diagnosing major depressive episode (MDE) to consensus diagnoses based on the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) interview. Subjects comprised a follow-up sample of 239 former high-school students (aged 20-24 yrs) who were administered the SCAN and immediately thereafter the CIDI-SF. Concordance was estimated for 12-mo MDE, using different cut-points of the CIDI-SF and for any affective disorders. Results show that correspondence between instruments was moderate for MDE, but better for any affective disorder. Most false negatives suffered from their depression as much as those correctly identified by the CIDI-SF. False negativity was mainly due to not endorsing the stem questions of the CIDI-SF. Of the false positives, almost half had an affective disorder other than MDE. It is concluded that the CIDI-SF seems to function best in identifying a broader category of affective disorders, and that it could be useful in large-scale community surveys where more extensive psychiatric interviews are not feasible.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments to test the Spinozan model of beliving. Experiment 1 used a dispositional attribution paradigm to test the hypothesis that older adults (OAs) would be more likely than young adults (YAs) to believe false information of because of their reduced cognitive resources. 36 YAs (aged 18-29 yrs) and 36 OAs (aged 60-80 yrs) were exposed to both true and false (either positive or negative) trait information about 2 target persons. Participants then made dispositional ratings, evaluated the target persons on overall likeability scales, and performed a recognition task for whether information had been previously presented as true, as false, or not presented. Results support the Spinozan model of believing. OAs were more likely than YAs to believe false information and their dispositional ratings were reliably biased by the valence of false information. Experiment 2 further examined whether these false beliefs of OAs were actually conscious beliefs using a variation on the recognition task procedure in Experiment 1. 24 YAs (aged 18-25 yrs) and 24 OAs (aged 60-80 yrs) participated. Results show OAs consciously recollected the false statements as true and these false beliefs mediated age differences in dispositional attribution.

Abstract = {Examined the challenges faced by child protection systems (CPS) in assessment and case management where babies and infants have received serious and fatal physical injuries in the context of discrepant parent/carer explanations. The assessment sample resulted from a review of 203 referrals to child protection assessment services; 21 cases involving 26 0-2 yr olds were identified. The sample resulted in 17 cases of 0-2 yr olds. These 38 case files or review records of children under the age of 2 yrs with serious or fatal physical injuries were examined. Qualitative methods were employed to identify issues relating to types of parent/carer explanations, factors of concern in addition to the injuries, and CPS responses to the families. Findings indicate that the safety response by CPS to babies with serious injuries with discrepant explanations could be inadequate. Assessment of further risks could be inconsistent, especially in cases where there are few other factors of concern apart from the injury. It is concluded that there is a need for the development in the UK of more systematic decision-making processes to achieve more consistent standards of assessment and case management of high-risk infants and to minimize false-negative and false-positive predictions of further risk.

Abstract = {The attack that occurred on September 11, 2001 was, in the end, the result of a failure to detect and prevent the terrorist operations that hit the US. The US government thus faces at this time the daunting tasks of first, drastically increasing its ability to obtain and interpret different types of signals of impending terrorist attacks with sufficient lead time and accuracy, and second, improving its ability to react effectively. One of the main challenges is the fusion of information, from different sources (U.S. or foreign), and of different types (electronic signals, human intelligence, etc.). Fusion thus involves two very distinct and separate issues: communications, i.e., ensuring that the different U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies communicate all relevant and accurate information in a timely fashion and, perhaps more difficult, merging the content of signals, some "sharp" and some "fuzzy," some dependent and some independent into useful information. The focus of this article is on the latter issue, and on the use of the results. In this article, the author presents a classic probabilistic Bayesian model sometimes used in engineering risk analysis, which can be helpful in the fusion of information because it allows computation of the posterior probability of an event given its prior probability (before the signal is observed) and the quality of the signal characterized by the probabilities of false positive and false negative. Experience suggests that the nature of these errors has been sometimes misunderstood; therefore, the validity of several possible definitions is discussed.

Abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have emerged as the most reliable method of assessing the effects of health care interventions in clinical medicine. However, RCTs should be undertaken only if there is substantial uncertainty about which of the trial treatments would benefit a patient most. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of uncertainty in a research hypothesis before it can empirically be tested in an RCT. We integrated arguments from 3 independent lines of research--on ethics, principles of the design and conduct of clinical trials, and medical decision making--to develop a decision model to help solve the dilemma of under which circumstances innovative treatments should be tested in an RCT. We showed that RCTs are the preferable option to resolve uncertainties about competing treatment alternatives whenever we desire reliable, undisputed, high-quality evidence with a low likelihood of false-positive or false-negative results. When the expected benefit:risk ratio of a new treatment is small, an RCT is justified to resolve uncertainties over a wide range of prior belief in the accuracy of the research hypothesis. Randomized controlled trials represent the best means for resolving uncertainties about health care interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Occasional auditory stimuli were also presented to monitor false positive and false negative responses, and frequency of seeing (FOS) curves were calculated. Results show a significant increase in suprathreshold RT with increasing eccentricity. The RT at the calculated FOS 50% threshold was prolonged by approximately 200 msec, compared with the RT using the 0 dB auditory target at the equivalent eccentricities. When the difference between the RT at 0 dB stimulus and the RT at threshold was regressed against visual field eccentricity, there was a significant decrease with eccentricity. RT fit a power function with decreasing stimulus attenuation, but the slope flattened with eccentricity. The intraindividual standard deviations of the RT prolongation decreased with decreased stimulus attenuation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The results were: 29 ADHD/I; 12 RD, 16 ADHDA with RD; and, 41 controls. The RD group was included to evaluate specificity. The Brown was administered but not used in classification. The ADHD groups scored higher on the Brown subscales compared with the other two groups. The recommended cutoffs resulted in high rates of false negatives but few false positives; this suggests good specificity but poor sensitivity. There were moderate correlations among the Brown, CRS-R, and OCHSS. The Brown can be useful in screening out ADHD; however, its low sensitivity precludes its usefulness in diagnosing ADHD.

Abstract = {The effect of true and false feedback of facial blood flow on blushing and embarrassment was investigated in 24 high (aged 17–40 yrs) and 24 low (aged 17–42 yrs) scorers on the Blushing Propensity Scale. Feedback was given while the participants sang and read aloud. Blushing while singing habituated rapidly in both groups and was not affected by true feedback. Blushing still developed in high scorers when given false-negative feedback of blushing when they first sang, whereas low scorers did not blush. False-positive feedback of blushing while reading aloud increased embarrassment, but facial blood flow decreased. High scorers gave higher ratings for embarrassment and blushing than low scorers during most of the tasks. The findings suggest that people who think that they are prone to blushing feel more self-conscious but generally do not blush more intensely or frequently than people with low blushing propensity scores during clearly embarrassing or innocuous social encounters. However, expecting to blush might actually increase the likelihood of embarrassment and blushing in potentially embarrassing situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Argues that early detection and intervention offers a compelling perspective on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Relevant investigations include efforts to reduce the post-onset duration of untreated psychosis and efforts to identify and treat prodromally symptomatic high-risk Ss in the pre-onset phase of the disorder. There appears to be consensus that the benefits outweigh the risks in studies aiming to treat 1st episode psychotic Ss as soon as possible. However, there is less consensus about pre-onset detection and intervention studies, the major concerns being the false positive rate of case identification, the evidence of benefit, the side effects of treatment, the potential harm from being informed that one is at risk for psychosis, the false negative rate of case identification, and the inclusion of adolescents. In this article, each of these issues is elaborated upon and discussed in terms of the existing evidence informing risk and benefit and in light of the authors' own clinical experience conducting this research. It is concluded that there is not enough data to justify pre-onset detection and intervention as standard practice, but there is enough data concerning risk and benefit to justify pre-onset detection and intervention research.

Abstract = {Assessed the validity and reliability of different short versions of the geriatric depression scale (GDS). In particular, the authors have considered the 15-item, the 10-item and 5-item versions. The study involved 126 Ss without cognitive impairments (46 males and 80 females, aged 53-93 yrs). The 30-item version of the GDS, as well as the short versions of it, were administered to every patient, and the results of the different short versions correlated with the clinical diagnosis of depression and with the results of the 30-item version of the GDS. With these different versions of GDS it is possible discriminate between depressed and non-depressed subjects and there is a high concordance with clinical diagnosis of depression. In fact, at cut-off values, the comparison between the clinical diagnosis of depression and GDS scores show a very low percentage of false negative cases, while percentages of false positive cases were 41.93% in the 30-item version and 22.6% in the 5-item version. These results indicate that it is possible to employ different short forms of the GDS in the clinical practice, while maintaining validity.

Abstract = {Presents data on the main complaints reported in the acute aftermath of an industrial disaster by 246 Ss who were exposed. Sleep disturbance, anxiety/fear responses, and physical symptoms were reported by Ss with complaints in the acute phase as most problematic, while irritability and depressive symptoms appeared very infrequently among the reported main complaints. A high specificity and sensitivity were achieved in predicting later posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III) criteria, by applying early response variables; thus, there were few false-positives and false-negatives. There was a considerable overlap between the PTSD predictors and the main symptom complaints. From a prevention point of view, this should be advantageous, since it would bring the right people to seek help. However, in a significant proportion of the acutely distressed, the reluctance to seek help was motivated by the very symptoms that predicted PTSD. Even a relatively high rate of Ss agreeing to be screened (82.8%) would have lost 42% of those who qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, and more than half of the Ss with severe outcomes would not have been included. For primary and secondary prevention, the findings suggest that early screening and outreach should be very active. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), a 30-item scale developed by H. R. Lesieur and S. B. Blume (see record [rid]1988-03233-001[/rid]), is widely used in identifying pathological gamblers. Two studies examining the reliability and validity of the Turkish Form of the SOGS are reported. In the first study 59 Ss, and in the second study 73 Ss participated. The Ss were diagnosed as either pathological gamblers or non-pathological gamblers (comparison group). In the second study, pathological and non-pathological gamblers did not differ significantly in their preferred forms of gambling. The 2 groups were also similar to one another in terms of their gambling frequencies. 17 of the 30 original SOGS items were found to discriminate Turkish pathological gamblers from non-pathological gamblers. The 3 items that failed to discriminate pathological gamblers from non-pathological gamblers were replaced with 2 culturally relevant items. The cut off point for the 19-item Turkish Form of the SOGS that yielded the lowest false negative and false positive percentages (and thus has the highest sensitivity and specificity rates) was a score of 8. The pathological gamblers had SOGS scores almost 3 fold those of the non-pathological group, and the difference between the 2 groups was significant.

Abstract = {The present study investigated whether Human Figure Drawings (HFD) can be considered as valid and reliable devices to assess the intellectual abilities as well as the emotional adjustment in the practice of child psychologists. HFD are most popular of all drawing techniques often included in test batteries as relatively short, easy-to-administer, friendly and nonthreatening measures. Contradictory empirical evidence concerning their psychometric properties is presented with the aim to overcome the gap between large scale of the practical use and relatively small amount of scientific investigations. Draw-A-Person: A Quantitative Scoring System (DAP:QSS) and Draw-A-Person:Screening Procedure for Emotional Disturbance (DAP:SPED) created by Naglieri J. and colleagues were chosen as the most modern and objective scoring systems in regard to other HFD. Both techniques and WISC-IIILT were administered to clinical sample consisting of 95 children aged 6–16 with emotional / behavioral disturbances and 70 children without clinical disturbances closely matched for the age and gender criteria. T-test, correlations, discriminant and exploratory factor analysis were applied for data analysis. Results suggest that DAP:QSS shortly meets standards of concurrent validity with WISC-IIILT as it was found no statistically significant correlations with the scores of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IIILT (p > 0.05). Additionally, noncognitive factors – liking to draw and clinical disturbance – can cause biased results of assessment of intellectual abilities when using DAP: QSS: liking to draw correlates with the higher results as compared to WISC-IIILT scores, while intellectual abilities of the children with clinical disturbance were underestimated (p = 0.00). Standard error of estimation appeared to be higher when using DAP: QSS than WISC-IIILT. The total score of Draw-A-Person:Screening Procedure for Emotional Disturbance was significantly higher in the clinical sample (p = 0.00). It proves the validity of this instrument to screen the children for emotional maladjustment but the cases of false negative screening cast doubt about its strength. Both devices showed good reliability (internal consistency as well as inter-scorer). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The cancer is the second cause of mortality in Spain, with 97,007 deaths in 2004, which supposes 26.25% of all the deaths. During the last decade, the mortality for cancer of breast has diminished an average of 1.4% annual. Nevertheless, the breast cancer incidence in the woman has continued increasing in the last decade. In Spain, breast cancer has a high survival and experiencing a significant increase. At present, the totality of the Spanish's Autonomous Communities tells with a Program of Precocious Diagnosis of Cancer of Breast, completely developed, consolidated and that are among the most advanced of the European Union. In the set of the Spanish Programs, of majority form it offers the sifted one to the women from 50 to 69 years. The sum of the population reveille in Spain belongs to 4,308,912 women and to them, 98.9% this under coverage of a program of sifted organized. They have been invited when 4,261,535 women took part. There are in use 227 Mammography's Units. The reading mammography is realized independently by two radiologists with consensus in case of discrepancies exist. A whole of 460 technical specialists in radiology and 342 medical radiologists are employed at the programs. The quality control physicist-technician of the equipments carries out in agreement with "European Guidelines for quality assurance in mammography screening". The results of the programs, show a global participation (1990-2006) of 4,786,945 women of the mentioned 7,404,097, which represents a participation rate of 64.65% of the invited women. The cancer detection rate is 3.68 cancers for every thousand sifted women. Of all 17,217 tumors detected by the programs, 15% (CI 95% 8.59%-27.83%) were tumors "in situ", whereas 80% (CI 95% 55.07%-90.07%) had invading character and of 5% (CI 95% 0.10%-20.29%) remaining histology was unknown. Of all 13,774 invasive tumors, 26% (CI 95% 10.53%-38.02%) of the tumors was categories T2, T3 and T4). Others 38% (CI 95% 15.43%-45.85%) had a category of T1c and another 30% (CI 95% 15.54%-55.26%) had a size T1 mic, T1 a and T1 b. The invasion of the regional ganglions for the tumor was present in 27% (CI 95% 17.20%-33.39%) of the cases. It is possible to conclude that really the Programs of Beast Cancer Screening help to diminish the mortality for this pathology, always and when specific circuits of assistance are accompanied and assure treatments homogeneous and based on the best scientific evidence of every moment and fulfilled by trained professionals and thinking that in spite of everything always they are accompanied of effects not wished as the presence of false positives and negatives, the possible overtreatment and injuries not easily identified and the logical psychological impact before the uncertainty of the result, which since we know is not contemptible and it would advise of routine form monitoring in the organized Programs.

Abstract = {The objective of this prospective study was to determine the long-term predictive value of 3 neonatal neurologic assessments: brainstem auditory evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale. 78 high-risk newborns who graduated from a neonatal intensive care unit and 28 healthy controls were recruited and were assessed in the newborn period using these tests. At 8 to 9 yrs of age, 42 Ss and 13 controls were re-evaluated for developmental progress using a range of psychologic, sensorimotor, and neurologic measures. Findings indicate that the somatosensory evoked potential was most accurate at predicting outcome at school age, with high specificity (83–100%) across all domains tested and good sensitivity (80–100%) for intellectual performance and sensorimotor abilities. The brainstem auditory evoked potential was limited by false-negatives, whereas the neonatal neurobehavioral assessment yielded many false-positives. This study provides new evidence that associations between neonatal somatosensory evoked potentials and developmental sequelae continue to be significant at school age.

The method is based on expected-value decision theory in much the same way as is signal detection. It requires specification of the probabilities of misses (false negatives) and false alarms (false positives) for both human and automation being considered, as well as factors independent of the choice—namely, costs and benefits of incorrect and correct decisions as well as the prior probability of failure. The method can also serve as a basis for comparing different modes of automation. Some limiting cases of application are discussed, as are some decision criteria other than expected value. Actual or potential applications include the design and evaluation of any system in which either humans or automation are being considered.

The SCL-90-R was administered to 112 consecutive outpatients with various mood and anxiety disorders. The personality severity index (PSI) score, defined as the mean value of the scores on the SCL-90-R subscales of interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation, was compared with the current symptom index (CSI) score, defined as the mean value of the scores on the remaining 6 SCL-90-R subscales. The accuracy of the screen was verified by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) Personality Disorders. The sensitivity of the PSI > CSI criterion to screen for SPD was 89.4%, while its sensitivity to screen for any DSM-III-R personality disorder was 72.9%. Results suggest that the SCL-90-R may be used to screen for SPD in routine work with outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders, but the results of the screening need to be verified because of the possibility of false negatives and false positives.

Abstract = {A computerized algorithm was developed to predict child psychiatric diagnoses on the basis of the symptom and impact scores derived from Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) completed by parents, teachers and young people. The predictive algorithm generates "unlikely", "possible" or "probable" ratings for 4 broad categories of disorder, namely conduct disorders, emotional disorders, hyperactivity disorders, and any psychiatric disorder. The algorithm was applied to patients attending child mental health clinics in Britain (101 Ss aged 4–16 yrs) and Bangladesh (89 Ss aged 4–16 yrs). The level of chance-corrected agreement between SDQ prediction and an independent clinical diagnosis was substantial and highly significant. A "probable" SDQ prediction for any given disorder correctly identified 81–91% of the children who definitely had that clinical diagnosis. There were more false positives than false negatives, i.e. the SDQ categories were overinclusive. It is concluded that the algorithm appears to be sufficiently accurate and robust to be of practical value in planning the assessment of new referrals to a child mental health service.

The illustrative pamphlet decision-aid was effective in improving knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests: 95% of the experimental group were aware of the possibility of false-negative test results compared with 85% of the comparison group. 91% of the experimental group were aware of the possibility of a false-positive screening test result compared with 65% of the comparison group. However, there was no difference in the use of prostate cancer screening between the experimental (82%) and comparison (84%) groups. The authors concluded that when used in a primary care setting, an illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in increasing knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests but did not change the use of these tests.

Abstract = {Investigated depression and health care use in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). 44 adults (mean age 34.8 yrs) with SCD were interviewed and data from 43 Ss (mean age 35.1 yrs), both with (n = 11) and without (n = 32) depression, were used for further analyses. The full evaluation included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III—R Disorders and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), as well as measures of psychosocial and behavioral functioning. Good between-instrument agreement was found between the self-report and interview-based measures of depression. However the functioning data did not entirely support the use of a more stringent cutoff score on the CES-D. Findings suggest that the purpose of the evaluation should be factored into the decision-making process when determining which cutoff score should be utilized (i.e., what is the cost-benefit ratio for false-positives vs false-negatives). A series of hierarchical regression analyses supported the finding that disease severity alone does not explain the level of functioning displayed by patients.

Abstract = {A computerized method for classifying the postures of freely moving rodents is presented. The goal of this study was to develop a computerized method that provides an objective description and classification of rodent postures that can ultimately lay the foundation for classifying behaviors. The behavior of the rats was recorded on videotape by means of a camera hanging perpendicular to an open field. An automatic tracking system (10 images/sec) was used to transform the video images of postures into a binary image, thereby providing silhouettes in a computer format. The contours of these silhouettes were used for determining their characteristic features with the help of a Fourier transformation. Resulting features were classified with the help of a Kohonen network composed of 32 neurons. The four best winning neurons, rather than the usual one, were used for the classification. The resolution (11,090 distinct classes of postures), reliability (96.9%), and validity of this method were determined. With the use of the same approach, the effectiveness of this method for classifying behaviors was illustrated by analyzing grooming (247 grooming images vs 4,950 nongrooming images). The authors found 15.4% false positives and 2.5% false negatives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Performed a lab-based controlled study of the use of false positive and neutral feedback on facilitating increased subjective and genital arousal in 37 females with various degrees of spinal cord injury (SCI). 10 able-bodied females served as controls. It was hypothesized that all SCI Ss would have the capacity to increase their level of subjective sexual arousal through the use of false feedback. Furthermore, Ss with greater preservation of sensory function in the T11-L2 dermatomes, and thus a greater ability to have psychogenic genital vasocongestion, would have a greater degree of genital responsiveness than those Ss with minimal or no sensory preservation in these dermatomes. The protocol consisted of 4 baseline periods alternating with 3 periods of audiovisual erotic stimulation. Ss received either false positive or false neutral-negative feedback about their genital responsiveness as measured by a vaginal photoplethysmograph. Results provide evidence of the ability to positively alter level of cognitive sexual arousal using feedback in females with all degrees of SCIs. Furthermore, results confirm that those Ss with preservation of sensory function in the T11-L2 dermatomes also have the capacity for increasing genital sexual arousal through psychogenic sexual stimulation.

Abstract = {Examined the role of frontal brain areas in false recognition. Brain potentials were recorded from 15 healthy Ss (aged 20–28 yrs) during the performance of a word recognition task. During the study phase, Ss had to intentionally memorize a series of words. These words were presented again together with the same number of new words in a following test phase where the instruction was to discriminate between repeated words and new words. The authors compared event related potentials (ERPs) evoked by correctly identified repeated words (hits) and ERPs evoked by incorrectly classified new words (false alarms). Although both types of words were thought to be repeated the ERPs indicated differences between these two conditions starting at about 450 ms after the stimulus onset. These differences were mostly pronounced over frontal scalp locations but occurred also over parietal scalp locations (false alarms produced significantly more negative going ERPs than hits). The authors suggest that frontal and parietal brain areas show greater activation during false recognition because of a more intensive search for item representations.

Abstract = {A new theory of cognitive biases, called error management theory (EMT), proposes that psychological mechanisms are designed to be predictably biased when the costs of false-positive and false-negative errors were asymmetrical over evolutionary history. This theory explains known phenomena such as men's overperception of women's sexual intent, and it predicts new biases in social inference such as women's underestimation of men's commitment. In Study 1 (N = 217), the authors documented the commitment underperception effect predicted by EMT. In Study 2 (N = 289), the authors replicated the commitment bias and documented a condition in which men's sexual overperception bias is corrected. Discussion contrasts EMT with the heuristics and biases approach and suggests additional testable hypotheses based on EMT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Among clinical psychologists who use the Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS; Exner, 1993) and whose interest is centered on diagnosis or assessment, a mixture of irritation, frustration, confusion, and hopelessness spreads in the face of the SCZI Index’s failure, producing false positives in cases that are not schizophrenic (Campo, 1993, 1995, 1996) and false negatives in subjects who are in fact schizophrenic. This occurs despite its evident usefulness as a sign alerting to the presence of psychotic traits or nuclei. Since several normative studies with Hispanic subjects have shown that their perceptual accuracy is different from and lower than the CS’s normative data, it was thought that perhaps a cultural aspect in these samples, by influencing variables that measure the adequacy of perception and whose weight in the SCZI is important, are affecting its capacity to discriminate among subjects of the Hispanic social environment.

Abstract = {Objective: To profile and compare the content and presentation of written communications related to informed decision-making about mammography. Methods: Materials from 16 screening programs organized at the national or regional level were analyzed according to five major information domains suggested by the international literature. Results: A majority of countries provided information on the program (interval, cost and quality). There was considerable variability in comprehensiveness of elements in the domains, e.g., test characteristics (false positive/negative) and pros and cons of screening. The majority noted the likelihood of recall for further tests, few commented on the risks of additional tests or finding unimportant tumors. The audit also found variation in presentation (words and pictures). Conclusions: Presentation of comprehensive, but balanced information on screening benefits and risks is complex and daunting. Issues such as framing effects, coupled with debate about screening efficacy are challenging to the design of effective information tools. The objective of increasing screening prevalence at the population level must be balanced with objectively presenting complete and clear information. Additional research is needed on how information (and mode of presentation) impact screening decisions. Practice implications: Public health officials need to articulate their objectives and review written communication according to important decision-making domains.

Abstract = {Effort testing has become commonplace in clinical practice. Recent research has shown that performance on effort tests is highly correlated with performance on neuropsychological measures. Clinical application of effort testing is highly dependent on research derived interpretive guidelines. The Victoria Symptom Validity Test (VSVT) is one of many measures currently used in clinical practice. The VSVT has recommended interpretive guidelines published in the test manual, but the samples used in developing interpretive guidelines are small and heterogeneous and concern has been expressed regarding high false negative rates. In this study, a homogeneous sample of acute, severely brain injured persons were used to assess the sensitivity of the VSVT. Results confirmed that acute, severely brain injured persons (N = 71) perform very well on the VSVT. The severe brain injury population is 99% likely to have between 44.1 and 46.8 correct VSVT Combined Score responses. While the VSVT was insensitive to memory dysfunction, the presence of severe visual perceptual (Benton Visual Form Discrimination Score < 21) and verbal fluency (Controlled Ora Word Association Score < 15) deficits predicted poor performance on the VSVT. These results provide further evidence that performance expectations currently incorporated in the VSVT manual interpretative criteria are too conservative. Empirically based alternative criteria for interpreting VSVT Combined Scores in the TBI population are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) represent an effective means of promoting smoking cessation, but they remain underutilized. Negative attitudes and false beliefs about nicotine and nicotine replacement may cause NRT underutilization. In a randomized, controlled, single-blind study of nicotine gum, 97 smokers were assessed on their attitudes and knowledge about nicotine, nicotine replacement, and smoking cessation therapy. Information from these self-report measures was used in an intervention that provided tailored, brief feedback to promote positive attitudes and accurate knowledge about NRT. Considerable variability in pretreatment attitudes and knowledge was observed across individuals. Moreover, attitudes and knowledge showed a consistent pattern of intercorrelation and were systematically related to smoking characteristics (e.g., prior use of NRT, nicotine dependence, treatment completion). The brief feedback intervention led to a significant global elevation in attitudes about nicotine, NRT, and assisted cessation but not knowledge about nicotine. Changes in attitudes and knowledge were not significantly related to gum use or smoking cessation. Recommendations for the appropriate application of brief feedback are offered.

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to use the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) as a screening instrument on a specific population with a marked prevalence of binge eating disorder (BED) and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). The EAT-26 questionnaire was used in order to identify the high-risk subjects for referral to clinical evaluation. Method: EAT-26 was administered to 845 subjects who, for the first time, came to the Nutritional Medicine Service looking for a diet between January 1999 and December 2002. From this initial sample, subsequently, 250 subjects were randomly selected and administered a semistructured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID I, version 2.0). Results: Discriminant analysis provided a cutoff value of EAT-26=11. Logistic regression analysis indicated high Dieting (D) or Bulimia (B) subscale scores as a risk factor of EDNOS or bulimia nervosa (BN) cases, respectively; on the other hand, a high Oral Control (O) subscale score represented a protecting factor for BED cases. Conclusion: Our study tried to assess the usefulness of EAT-26 as a screening instrument for obese patients attending a Medical Nutritional Service. Results from this study suggest that a cutoff score of 11, lower than that indicated in the literature, improves the diagnostic accuracy of the EAT-26 in a high-risk setting regarding sensibility level (68.1%) and leading to a reduction of the false negative rate (31.9%).

Abstract = {Diagnosis and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain due to internal disc disruption (IDD) remains a challenge. It accounts for 39% of patients with low back pain. The mechanism of discogenic pain remains unclear and its clinical presentation is atypical. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can find high-intensity zone as an indirect indication of IDD. However, relative low sensitivity (26.7% to 59%) and high falsepositive (24%) and false-negative (38%) rates reduce the value of MRI in screening for the existence of painful IDD. Provocative discography can provide unique information about the pain source and the morphology of the disc. It may also provide information for selecting appropriate treatment for the painful annular tear. Adjunctive therapies, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, rehabilitation, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and acupuncture, have been used for low back pain. The value of these treatments for discogenic pain is yet to be established. Intradiscal steroid injection has not been proved to provide long-term benefits. Intradiscal electrothermal therapy may offer some pain relief for a group of well-selected patients. No benefits have been found for the intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation. A block in the ramus communicans may interfere with the transition of painful information from the discs to the central nervous system. Disc cell transplantation is in the experimental stage. It has the potential to become a useful tool for the prevention and treatment of discogenic pain. Minimally invasive treatments provide alternatives for discogenic pain with the appeal of cost-effectiveness and, possibly, less long-term side effects. However, the value of most of these therapies is yet to be established. More basic science and clinical studies are needed to improve the clinical efficacy of minimally invasive treatments.

Abstract = {In this article we examine the two major classes of side effects with atypical antipsychotics: extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and the metabolic syndrome (the triad of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, with associated obesity). We conclude that atypical antipsychotics continue to have notable risks of EPS, particularly akathisia, and that these agents also appear to increase the risk of the metabolic syndrome, though this effect seems most marked with clozapine and olanzapine. Novel conclusions based on this review are as follows: we provide a classification scheme based on low versus high D2 binding affinity (which is, to our knowledge, a new means of classifying atypical antipsychotics); we emphasize that the akathisia risk is likely equal among agents and that tardive dyskinesia is an early, and not late, risk in treatment (a common misconception); we make the methodological point that in randomized clinical trials, there is a high risk of false-negatives regarding side effects; we raise the issue of confounding bias in epidemiological studies of metabolic syndrome; and we stress the need to compare side effects in the same studies and not different studies. Future prospective observational cohort studies must target side effects and be designed to collect and analyze data on confounding factors.

Abstract = {Screening measures to identify very young children at risk for autism spectrum disorders include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). To examine the validity of these written questionnaires, parents completed them prior to their child's diagnostic assessment at a tertiary autism clinic. The M-CHAT was given to 84 parents of 2- to 3-year-olds and the SCQ to 94 parents of 4- to 6-year-olds. On both measures sensitivity was higher than specificity with positive predictive values 0.63-0.68. False negatives, or children with autism who were missed by screening, were somewhat higher functioning than true positives. Results were better for parents who spoke English as a second language, contrary to expectations. At this stage of development these tools would be recommended as part of more comprehensive surveillance programmes to identify children in need of further assessment but not to 'screen out' the possibility of autism.

Abstract = {Background: The study measured the accuracy of the Italian version of the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) for self-assessment as a screening instrument for bipolar disorder (BPD) in a psychiatric setting and compared results with a previous study, carried out in a comparable sample and in the same setting, using the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). Methods: 123 consecutive subjects attending a psychiatric division were screened for BPD using the Italian translation of the HCL-32, and diagnostically interviewed with the SCID by physicians. The sample of the previous study using the MDQ consisted of 154 subjects. Results: On the basis of the SCID: 26 received a diagnosis of bipolar/schizoaffective disorder, 57 were diagnosed as having at least another psychiatric disorder in Axis-I, whilst 40 were unaffected by any type of psychiatric disorder. Comparing the bipolar with all other patients the HCL-32 showed a good accuracy: cut-off 8: sensitivity 0.92-specificity 0.48; cut-off 10: sensitivity 0.88-specificity 0.54; cut-off 12: sensitivity 0.85-specificity 0.61. The accuracy for BPD-II (10) remains good: cut-off 8: sensitivity 0.90-specificity 0.42; cut-off 10: sensitivity 0.80-specificity 0.47; cut-off 12: sensitivity 0.80-specificity 0.54. The comparison with the MDQ performance shows that both screening tools may show good results, but HCL-32 seems to be more sensitive in detecting BPD-II. Conclusion: Our results seem to indicate good accuracy of HCL-32 as a screening instrument for BPD in a psychiatric setting, with a low rate of false negatives, and a fairly good degree of identification of BPD-II.

Abstract = {A major change in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) is the inclusion in almost one-half of the diagnostic criteria sets of a clinical significance criterion, which requires that symptoms cause "clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning." The effect of the clinical significance criterion on the diagnostic validity of DSM-IV criteria for a wide range of disorders was examined. For many diagnoses to which the clinical significance criterion was added, the symptom criteria are inherently associated with significant impairment, so the clinical significance criterion is redundant and therefore does not affect caseness. For some diagnoses, the clinical significance criterion is potentially helpful in eliminating false positives by elevating the level of required distress. However, there may be advantages to obtaining the same results by modifying some of the symptom criteria. Often the clinical significance criterion has led to the possibility of false negative diagnoses. The authors conclude that the process of revising DSM-IV, the generic use of the clinical significance criterion should be reconsidered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied the validity of the General Health Questionnaire-28 in a Spanish population. A total of 660 normal male and female adolescents and adults (aged 15 yrs and older) participated in the initial phase. The 2nd stage sample was composed of all 85 Ss who scored above the cut-off point of 4 (possible psychiatric cases) and a random sample of 85 Ss who scored below the cut-off point (possible psychiatric non-cases). The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS) was used in the comparisons. The results were evaluated according to age, sex, diagnosis of psychiatric disease by the CIS, disease diagnosis, and psychopathologic severity. With a cut-off score of 5 or above, sensitivity was 90.5 percent, specificity was 73.1 percent, and overall false-positive false-negative rates were 20.8 percent.

Abstract = {Investigated the potential utility of asking parents about health care utilization as a means of identifying individuals at risk for psychosocial problems. Parents of 366 children (aged 2–16 yrs) completed questionnaires about their own, their child's, and their family's psychosocial functioning and health care utilization. Children and parents with high health care utilization were more likely to have psychosocial problems than those with low health care utilization. Sensitivity and specificity of health care utilization as a marker for psychosocial problems ranged from 43.8% to 68.8%. Although high rates of child health care utilization are related to the presence of psychosocial problems, use of this measure alone could result in many false-positive and false-negative identifications. Rather, use of health care utilization data in conjunction with other screening measures may be useful for alerting physicians to the possibility of both child and parent psychosocial problems.

Abstract = {Assesses and updates data related to the use of lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate and tiagabine as mood stabilisers. The published trials and case reports were collated from searches of the Cochrane Collaboration, Medline and Micromedex from January 1985 to January 1999. The manufacturers were also contacted. The search included other aspects of the usage of these anticonvulsants, such as side-effects and drug interactions. Results show that most of the data are in the form of anecdotal case reports and small scale open studies. The majority of the trials lack a placebo arm and do not use standard rating scales or standard diagnostic criteria. The usefulness of the results is partly limited by the short durations and small sample sizes. Furthermore, it is often unclear whether concomitant medication was altered. Therefore, any conclusion of effectiveness requires confirmation in double-blind placebo-controlled studies to eliminate any false-positive response due to bias, placebo effects or random variability. There is also possibility of false-negative selection bias, as the early data tends to relate to a more refractory population. The use of these newer anticonvulsants as mood stabilisers is currently under investigation in a clinical trial programme. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Evaluated the usefulness of N18 in median somatosensory evoked potential (EP) for the diagnosis of brain death in comparison with auditory brain stem responses and P13/14 in median somatosensory EP for 19 deeply comatose or brain dead patients (aged 20–79 yrs). 13 recordings were performed in deeply comatose but not brain dead conditions, and 12 recordings were performed in brain death. Results show that N18 was preserved in 12 of 13 non-brain dead comatose recordings whereas it was completely lost for all of the 12 brain death recordings. P13/14 in median somatosensory EP was preserved for all the comatose recordings, whereas apparent P13/14-like potentials, usually of low amplitude, were seen in 9 of 12 brain death recordings (frequent false positives). The auditory brain responses already showed features which were characteristic for brain death for 4 comatose recordings, in 3 of which N18 was preserved. In the 4 patients followed up for the course of progression from coma to brain death, N18 preserved in normal size during the comatose state was completely lost after brain death was established. N18 is suggested to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of brain death because there were no false positives and rare false negatives in the present series for detecting the remaining brain stem function.

Abstract = {For those in the prevention field who need to use risk factors to identify those at risk, mere statistical significance is not sufficient to establish clinical or policy significance. For that purpose, some measure of "potency" of risk factors is needed, that is, an effect size interpretable and meaningful in a clinical or policy context. The numerous possible candidate measures available often lead to contradictory conclusions. Which of the candidate measures is right or wrong for clinical and policy decision making depends on the fit between the trade-offs between false-positive and false-negative decisions implicit in the definition of the measure (and often unknown to the user) and those related to a specific context of application.

Abstract = {Targeted gene mutation technology represents a tool for biomedical research. When the targeted gene is expressed in the brain, the behavioral phenotype of the mutant mice may reveal genetic mechanisms underlying normal behaviors, and may increase the knowledge of genetic factors in neuropsychiatric disorders. Rigorous experimental design can minimize the high risk of false positives and false negatives in the behavioral phenotyping of a new transgenic or knockout mouse. Strategies developed and used by the author's laboratory are described in this review. Preliminary observations evaluate general health and neurological reflexes. Sensory abilities and motor functions are extensively quantitated and specific tests are described. Hypothesis testing then focuses on at least 3 well-validated tasks within each relevant behavioral domain. Specific tests for mice are described herein for the domains of learning and memory, feeding, nociception, and behaviors relevant to discrete symptoms of human anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. An example of the approach is illustrated in the behavioral phenotyping of C/EBPδ knockout mice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigated whether children's ability to recognize themselves in delayed video feedback indicates changes in self-awareness (D. J. Povinelli et al, 1996). Children were presented with 3-min-old videos of themselves to test whether they would investigate the current state of affairs upon seeing a surprising element in the video. In one condition, a sticker had been covertly placed into the child's hair, and in another an object had been hidden in a box. Both conditions proved equally difficult and performance correlated. Four-year-olds performed better than 3-year-olds, and children who failed the tasks retrieved the "surprise" item when presented with a mirror. There was no evidence to suggest that children's difficulties were due to immature metarepresentational thinking, lack of experience, problems with the questions, or problems appreciating the correspondence between image and referent. Yet, the parallel results in both conditions and the likelihood of false positives and false negatives indicate that the video test in its present form may not be a valid measure of differences in self-awareness.

Abstract = {62 children (aged 5–8 yrs) and 12 adults (aged 21–28 yrs) participated in a test of the belief that visual sensitivity improves substantially during childhood. Age-related change in visual sensitivity is generally attributed to maturation of the retino-striate pathways; the present study evaluated the extent to which attentional factors emphasize the effect of age. After familiarization, sensitivity was assessed at 2 locations in the superior temporal field using a bracketing technique. False-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) catch-trials were interspersed with the sequence of stimuli. Age affected sensitivity, and the general level of attentiveness varied not only with age, but also among Ss in the same age group. The extent to which improved visual sensitivity may reflect a concomitant evolution of vigilance was then estimated. Factors for evaluating attentiveness (rate of FN responses, slope of the psychometric function at the median, and goodness of fit) were much better predictors of sensitivity than was age. More significantly, the grouping of Ss into homogeneous subgroups on the basis of their attentional performance showed that children as young as 5 yrs may have a visual sensitivity that is only marginally lower than that of adults.

The method is based on basic principles Of probability and likelihood theory but can be used without sophisticated knowledge of this theory. The method relies on 2 rules, the "Rule of All Configurations" and the "Rule of Fundamental Probabilities," which are explained and illustrated. The Unified Approach does not represent new or original mathematics but should make it easier for users to calculate risks accurately. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to differentiate among, and to describe the support for each of 6 different forms of sex bias in the diagnosis of personality disorders, with the hope of contributing to their recognition and ultimate resolution. These biases include biased diagnostic constructs, biased thresholds for diagnosis, biased population sampling, biased application of diagnostic criteria, biased instruments of assessment, and biased diagnostic criteria. It is important to understand these different forms of sex bias, as each can occur independently of, be confused with, and interact with one another. The author proposes that the solution may not be to alter the constructions of a diagnostic taxonomy that fails to obtain a differential sex prevalence rate or fails to include any gender-related symptomatology, but instead to construct (and apply) a diagnostic taxonomy that minimizes false positive and false negative errors for men and for women.

Abstract = {Examined the sensitivity of the Spontaneous Selective Attention Task (SSAT) by comparing the performance of 40 schizophrenic inpatients and 30 schizophrenic outpatients to that of 70 normal controls. The pattern of results reported previously for schizophrenic inpatients vs controls was replicated, and these findings were extended to include schizophrenic outpatients in partial symptom remission. Schizophrenic inpatients and outpatients were just as accurate in identifying words as controls, but spontaneous selective attention under conditions of predictability was abnormal in both patient groups. Furthermore, the ability of the SSAT to discriminate between schizophrenic patients and controls was confirmed. A ratio measure of spontaneous selective attention had a sensitivity of 77% and a base rate of 9% in a normal population (when a cutoff value was set to minimize false positives and false negatives). Thus, the SSAT is shown to be a sensitive measure of an attentional phenotype that may be useful in genetic studies of schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The evaluation of community-based programs poses special design and analysis problems. The present article focuses on 2 major types of errors that can occur in such evaluations: false positives—incorrectly declaring a program to be effective—and false negatives—incorrectly declaring a program to be ineffective. The evaluation of a national demonstration of community-based programs to reduce substance abuse, Fighting Back, is used to illustrate several approaches to reduce the probability of errors. Both those errors that are affected by the design and those by analytic approaches are considered. Ways to assess multiple outcomes and to match the complexity of the program with design and analytic strategies are proposed. Community trials are complex interventions, and, although they can provide very useful information, their outcomes have to be understood in terms of the constructs they test and the contexts within which they are carried out (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Signal detection theory was used to examine the effects of sensitivity and bias in covariation detection. On each trial, 24 Ss judged whether a sample of paired data was drawn from a correlated or an uncorrelated population. Ss were instructed to classify a given sample as having originated from a correlated or an uncorrelated population. The prior likelihood of encountering a sample drawn from a correlated population was also manipulated, resulting in higher proportions of false positive and false negative errors than were expected on the basis of a Bayesian classification rule. These biases did not hinder sensitivity, nor did they enhance sensitivity. Moreover, although these biases were somewhat more extreme than Bayes' theorem would predict, there was a tendency for observers to shift their decision criteria optimally as a function of the degree of the signal-plus-noise population correlation.

Abstract = {Determined the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of Pick's disease by presenting 105 autopsy-confirmed cases of Pick's (n =  7) and related disorders (n =  98) as clinical vignettes in randomized order to 6 neurologists who were unaware of the autopsy findings. The group of raters had moderate to fair agreement for the diagnosis of Pick's as measured by the κ statistics. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of Pick's for the 1st visit and last visit was low (0–71%), but specificity was near-perfect. Median positive predictive values at both visits were 83–85%. False-negative misdiagnoses mainly involved Alzheimer's disease (AD). False-positive diagnoses were rare and occurred with corticobasal degeneration (1st visit) and with dementia with Lewy bodies (last visit). Pick's was also misdiagnosed by primary neurologists. The best clinical predictors for the early diagnosis of Pick's included, frontal dementia, early cortical dementia with severe frontal lobe disturbances, absence of apraxia, and absence of gait disturbance at onset. However, the 1st neurologic evaluation in some of the Pick's cases took place in advanced stages of the disease. Findings suggest that this disorder is underdiagnosed in clinical practice.

Abstract = {Examined whether (1) the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Exam (NCSE) screen items adequately identify impaired and unimpaired performance; (2) the NCSE subtest are correlated with full neuropsychological tests of the same cognitive domain; and (3) the determination of impairment on the NCSE subtests agrees with impairment classifications based on neuropsychological (NP) tests of similar domains. 54 patients (mean age 62.1 yrs) from neuropsychologic and geriatric units completed the NCSE and common NP tests assessing similar abilities. Most subtest screens (brief items that determine whether additional testing should occur) exhibited low false negative rates, but high false positive rates, based upon performance on the follow-up metric items. Each subtest was significantly correlated with the associated NP test. Using performance on the NP test as the gold standard, the NCSE subtests classified impaired and unimpaired patients at a much lower than expected rate.

Abstract = {Examined the reliability and validity of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) when used as a cognitive screening instrument, and compared different scoring methods (Shulman, Sunderland and Wolf-Klein). Ss were 28 patients (aged 50–89 yrs) attending a memory clinic for assessment who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 28 controls. All methods of scoring the CDT correlated well with measures of cognitive impairment and daily performance, were independent of mild depression and demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity and interrater reliability. While all clock scales identified mild to moderate dementia reasonably well, the Shulman method performed best. In screening for dementia, clock drawing proved superior to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). When compared with the MMSE, clock drawing provided additional diagnostic discrimination, identifying 7/8 AD patients with MMSE scores >24. In a clinic population, clock drawing, especially if scored according to the Shulman scale and combined with the MMSE, is an extremely efficient test screening measure for mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type with low false negative and false positive rates.

The most frequent reasons for referral were evaluation of coping problems (42%), assessment of possible depression (31%), and assessment of psychotropic medication (24.5%). The most common psychiatric diagnoses were mood disorders (36.5%), psychoactive substance use disorders (22.7%), and organic mental disorders (18.1%). Overall concordance of recognition of depression by the referring doctor and diagnosis of depression by the consultant psychiatrist was 79%; there was a 20% false positive rate and 23% false negative rate.

Abstract = {Tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to be useful for the treatment of pain of varying etiology. Monoaminergic systems seem to be implicated in this phenomenon. In this study, the influence of the selective β₁- (CGP 20712A) and β₂- (ICI 118551) adrenergic blockers on the antinociceptive effect of desipramine and nortriptyline was studied in male mice using physical and chemical nociceptive tests that implicate different levels of sensory-motor integration in the CNS. An activity test was performed to detect "false positive" or "false negative" results. Results obtained show that both CGP 20712A and ICI 118551 are able to antagonize the antinociceptive effect of these antidepressants in physical tests (hot-plate and tail-flick). However, in chemical tests (acetic acid and formalin), the analgesic effect of the antidepressants used was only antagonized by CGP 20712A. Results suggest that the analgesic effect of desipramine and nortriptyline is mediated by β-adrenoceptors. The β-adrenoceptor involved depends on the type of nociceptive stimulus: β₁ and β₂ are both implicated when the stimulus is physical, but only β₁ is involved when the stimulus is chemical.

Ss were interviewed with the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE) and Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III—Revised: Nonpatient Version (SCID-P) following initial screening to differentiate broadly between those Ss who might have a clinically significant psychiatric disorder from those who do not. The screen failed to miss anyone who was found to have a definite PD, when examined by experienced clinicians with a reliable semistructured interview. Efforts to reduce the number of false-positive cases by raising the screening threshold resulted in a significant increase in the number of false-negative results. The screen missed 9% of those who were included in the combined definite or probable category. Compared with the clinicians the screen tended to be conservative in making diagnosis.

Primary health care (PHC) clinic and traditional medical practitioner (TMP) clinic attenders (N = 302) were given the Shona Symptom Questionnaire, the CISR, and the Explanatory Model Interview. The PHC nurses and TMPs were interviewed to elicit diagnostic formulation using the WHO Health Staff Rating codes. "Etic" cases were those who scored 12 or more on the CISR and "emic" cases were those whom the care provider had assessed as having a mental disorder. In all, 52% of Ss were classified as etic cases and 59% as emic cases. Overall agreement between 2 two criteria was 55%. Three-quarters of care provider "false-positives" were accounted for by a failure to take into account the varying reasons for consultation, such as social or spiritual problems. Most of the "false-negative" groups were symptomatic Ss, though with fewer symptoms than those who were "definite cases." One etic concept—phobia—was not considered as a mental disorder and appeared to lack concept validity in this setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Finally, some cognitive variables such as intolerance of uncertainty, false beliefs about worry, negative problem orientation and cognitive avoidance have been suggested as playing a determinant role in the development and maintenance of GAD.

Such observations stimulate further discussion of the report from Pennsylvania on reducing use of seclusion and restraint. Although Quanbeck and colleagues' report did not specifically address seclusion and restraint, it underscores the importance of having a range of available interventions to reduce the adverse consequences of assaultive behaviors. The author believes that further clarification of secondary risks appears warranted. The author suggests that strategies, such as those described by Quanbeck and colleagues, to characterize subtypes of assaultive behaviors may help identify optimal preventive interventions for those at risk of aggression, thereby reducing the rates of true and false positives and false negatives.

I read Johansson's article on functional magnetic resonance imagings with interest. This particular investigation proved to be of immense value in the diagnosis and treatment of the three selected patients who were involved in significant motor vehicle accidents, and who developed compelling symptoms of cervicoencephalic syndrome. As a series of case studies, however, the article has limitations. In particular, there are insufficient data to address the thorny issues of false-positives, false-negatives and predictive values. Without any doubt, a psychosocial interpretation of the clinical presentation in the three selected cases of Johansson's article would have been inappropriate. In my view, the editorial does a disservice to clinicians by implying that because a specific tissue diagnosis is established in the three selected patients of Johansson, it must therefore be so in all other cases. In reality, what is a probability in one clinical context may just be a remote possibility in the next. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Since a percentage of male and female patients with dissociative disorders act out aggression and display criminal behaviors, some of them may be found in the criminal justice system. This case report demonstrates that the long-term failure to diagnose dissociative identity disorder in a male forensic psychiatric patient permitted the continued existence of highly aggressive dissociative identity states, and near relapses into homicidal behavior.

Abstract = {A previously reported (R. L. Woods and W. D. Thomson, 1993) spatial frequency dependent change in contrast sensitivity, apparently produced by the psychometric method used, was investigated in 2 experiments. A total of 30 colleagues and volunteers (aged 21–60 yrs) participated in the experiments. A relative reduction in the measured contrast sensitivity function at higher spatial frequencies was found when using a simple single staircase procedure, even when all external characteristics of the presentation procedure were the same as a more sophisticated and more reliable psychometric method (adaptive probit estimation). The estimated false–negative response rate was found to be greater for the single staircase procedure and was greater at a higher spatial frequency, while the false–positive response rate to interleaved blank presentations did not vary between spatial frequencies and between the 2 psychometric methods. This supports the suggestion that some Ss, given a knowledge of the psychometric method controlling grating contrast, may adopt different decision criteria at different spatial frequencies.

Abstract = {To address the mechanisms behind a reduced averaged P300 amplitude, a single-trial analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) based on digital filtering and P300 measurement, was performed in 18 21–56 yr old schizophrenics and 11 20–61 yr old unmedicated depressives using a standard "oddball" paradigm. This analysis provides estimates of the magnitude of the positive deflection occurring around the latency of P300 following target and nontarget stimuli. "False negative" and "false positive" responses were operationally defined according to the density functions of the amplitude distributions. Statistical analyses showed a reduction of the single trial P300 amplitude in depressive Ss and a combination of amplitude reduction with fewer elicited single trial P300 waves in schizophrenics. These results indicate that both mechanisms will give rise to a reduced P300 amplitude when averaging single events. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Mental health professionals often become concerned with the question of whether a child has been sexually abused, because the laws of most states stipulate that they are mandated reporters, but also because (1) sometimes it is the principal referral question; (2) recent epidemiological studies suggest a sufficiently high base rate for routine assessment; (3) it is relevant to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and (4) it is relevant to treatment planning. In recent years, investigatory interviewing has become increasingly controversial with complaints of both false positives and false negatives. This paper critically reviews investigative interviewing and statement validity analysis for assessing the credibility of child abuse allegations. A model for understanding children's reports is presented based on the development of children's information processing through 5 stages (sensation, perception, encoding, storage and retrieval) and hypothesis testing assessment. Data comparing free and cued recall and suggestibility between younger and older children and adults have implications for trends in interviewing children who are alleged to be sexual abuse victims.

Abstract = {Explores how people deal with the possibility that some of the feedback is erroneous when evaluating experimental evidence. The potential for error means that evidence evaluation must include decisions about when to "trust the data." Two studies are presented that focus on 179 Ss' responses to erroneous feedback in a hypothesis testing situation—a variant of P. C. Wason's (1960) rule discovery task in which some feedback was subject to system error, that is, "hits" were reported as "misses" and vice versa. Results showed that, in contrast to previous research, people are equally adept at identifying false negatives and false positives; further, successful Ss were less likely to use a positive test strategy than were unsuccessful Ss. Finally, although others have found that generating possible hypotheses prior to experimentation increases success and task efficiency, such a manipulation did little to mitigate the effects of system error.

Abstract = {This study compared the accuracy of an actuarial procedure for the prediction of community violence by patients with mental illnesses with the accuracy of clinicians' ratings of concern about patients' violence. Data came from a study in which patients were followed in the community for 6 mo after having been seen in a psychiatric emergency room. Accuracy of actuarial prediction was estimated retrospectively, with a statistical correction for capitalization on chance. Actuarial prediction had lower rates of false-positive and false-negative errors than clinical prediction. The seriousness of the violence correctly identified by the actuarial predictor (the true positives) was similar to the seriousness identified by clinicians. Actuarial predictions based only on patients' histories of violence were more accurate than clinical predictions, as were actuarial predictions that did not use information about histories.

Abstract = {Attempted to validate the Geriatric Depression Scale translated version (Chinese) with a psychiatric outpatient sample of 461 patients aged 60 or above, from 10 government-maintained psychiatric outpatient clinics between January 1992 and February 1993. Reliabilities and validities were exceptional. Internal consistency reliability was .89 (alpha), and the test–retest reliability was .85 (alpha). Criterion-related (psychiatrist diagnosis) validity was good at .95, and concurrent validity (with CES-D) was .96. Item analysis also confirmed consistency: all 30 items were significantly correlated with the full GDS. However, its sensitivity (70.6%), specificity (70.1 %), false negatives (29.4%), and false positives (29.9%), though acceptable, were not as impressive. The overall result has shown that the GDS is generally applicable to the Chinese elderly population and is good for measuring depressive symptoms.

Abstract = {We asked how control deprivation affects stereotyping in high- and low-prejudiced individuals. Following pre-training with solvable or unsolvable problems, participants were sequentially presented with stereotype-consistent, inconsistent, or irrelevant (positive and negative) traits of various Gipsy persons during group impression formation. Recognition memory and typicality of traits for Gipsy people were measured. Major findings: In comparison to highly prejudiced, low prejudiced participants spent much more time on reading inconsistent traits, showed less extreme typicality judgments, and responded slower during recognition test. Control deprivation decreased an impact of Gipsy stereotype on attention allocation, increased typicality of negative traits and-for prejudiced participants-increased rate of false alarms for negative traits in recognition memory. Overall, the study confirms differences in stereotyping between low- and high-prejudiced individuals (the latter are more schematic, "experts"). It also suggests that loss of control may decrease stereotyping but increase an impact of prejudiced attitudes on evaluations and memory for target group' traits.

To maximize external validity, only men undergoing psychological evaluations were used as participants. 41 Ss were identified as suspected malingerers through multiple criteria and were contrasted with schizophrenic-spectrum and clinic outpatient groups. Suspected malingers were asked to take the test without exaggerating. There were many false positives and fewer, but nonetheless many, false negatives with standard malingering indices. It appeared that the Gough Dissimulation Scale (H. G. Gough; 1947) might hold the most promise as a measure of malingering, but other scales are also useful.

Abstract = {Compared comparative blocks and the criterion-standard of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled blocks in the diagnosis of cervical zygapophysial joint pain. Ss were 50 consecutive adult patients referred for assessment of chronic neck pain (>3 mo duration) after a motor vehicle accident who completed a series of placebo-controlled blocks after an initial positive response. Ss underwent 3 blocks using 3 different agents: lignocaine, bupivacaine, and normal saline–administered on separate occasions, in random order and under double-blind conditions. Comparative blocks had a specificity of 88%, but only marginal sensitivity (54%). Although comparative blocks result in few false-positive diagnoses, they result in a high proportion of false-negative diagnoses. Expanding the comparative blocks diagnostic criteria to include all patients with reproducible relief, irrespective of duration, increases sensitivity to 100% but lowers specificity to 65%.

Abstract = {Discusses child abuse detection with reference to sensitivity and specificity. Many state laws include a penalty for failure to report child abuse and provide immunity from both criminal and civil liability to persons making reports in good faith. There are social and economic costs associated with an incorrect diagnosis of child abuse. The stigma of child abuse and erroneous reports have damaging consequences on the children and their families. Systems to reduce the frequency of false negatives and false positive need to be introduced into child abuse detection to prevent inaccurate reporting. It is essential to establish multiagency processes to coordinate data and resources from various child care providers and advocates. Its objective should be to improve the specificity of child abuse detection while maintaining sensitivity. Further, routine validity checks should be established when an allegation of child abuse is made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The etiology and mechanisms of stroke could differ in cancer compared to non-cancer patients due to altered blood coagulability and/or non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). These conditions could be either missed by using inappropriate diagnostic methods or misinterpreted. For instance, certain techniques (transthoracic echocardiography, TTE) may provide false-negative results and delay appropriate therapy. On the other hand, these patients, by having atypical findings, may challenge the differential between bacterial and sterile valvular heart disease. Cerebrovascular disease in cancer patients is often aggressive with tendency to recurrent events and rapid neurological devastation. Timely diagnosis is crucial. Current treatment approach to NBTE includes anticoagulation. We report a case of multiple embolic strokes in a patient diagnosed with lung cancer.

Abstract = {Introduction: Because there is a high rate of partial response to standard thymoleptic medication, novel augmentation strategies for treatment-resistant bipolar disorder are needed. In an open trial, donepezil augmentation was associated with improvement in manic symptoms in 9 of 11 subjects. Method: We conducted a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil for treatment-resistant bipolar mania. Eligible subjects had a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of at least 15 despite two or more weeks of proven therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate. Subjects who completed the trial were eligible for an 8-week open trial of donepezil. Subjects were started on donepezil 5 mg/day and were eligible for dose increase to 10 mg/day after 4 weeks. Results: Twelve subjects were enrolled. Eleven subjects received at least 1 week of study medication and were included in the analysis. No subjects in the donepezil group (0/6) and 60% (3/5) in the placebo group met response criteria of >30% reduction in YMRS score (Fisher's Exact p = 0.061). YMRS scores were higher at trial endpoint in the donepezil group 20.17 (3.66) compared with the placebo group [11.20 (4.60), Z= -2.476, p=0.01]. There were no differences at trial endpoint in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores in either the intent-to-treat or the completer analyses. Conclusions: Donepezil does not appear to be an effective adjunctive treatment for refractory manic symptoms. The strength of the conclusion of this trial is limited by the possibility of a false-negative result due to the small sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The aim of newborn screening is to identify presymptomatic healthy infants that will develop significant metabolic or endocrine derangements if left undiagnosed and untreated. The goal of ultimately reducing or eliminating irreversible sequelae is reached by maximizing test sensitivity of the primary newborn screening that measures specific analytes by a number of methodologies. Differentiation of true from false negatives is accomplished by the test specificity. This review discusses disorders for which, in general, there are available therapies and that are detected by routine and expanded newborn screening. Recommendations are presented for evaluation by a primary care physician, with confirmation by a metabolic or endocrinology specialist. Disorders are organized in tabular format by class of pathway or analyte, with attention to typical clinical presentations, confirmatory biochemical and molecular tests, and therapies. There are numerous challenges in clinical follow-up, including diagnosis and appropriate understanding of the consequences of the disorders. The data required to meet these challenges can be acquired only by large scale longitudinal comprehensive studies of outcome in children identified by newborn screening. Only with such data can newborn screening fully serve families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The association of and difference between urinalysis, self- and parent collateral-report of alcohol and substance use at baseline, 3- and 9-month follow-up was assessed for 88 male and female adolescents from a treatment study. While urinalyses rates were higher than self and collateral-report, urinalyses and self-report did not differ significantly at follow-up. Associations between urinalyses and self-report were highest (r = .64, .69), followed by youth-/collateral report (.49, .55), and urinalyses/collateral-report (.28, .43). Change in youth subjective substance use was associated with collateral subjective perceptions of use at follow-up. Higher false-negatives render collateral less reliable than self-report but necessary in the assessment process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

For all the instruments, except the SASS, estimates of internal consistency were satisfactory. When used as a continuous measure of symptom frequency and intensity, the CAPS-1 had excellent convergent validity for all three ethnic groups, while formal PTSD criteria yielded high numbers of false negative diagnoses. Among the questionnaires, for Chechnyans the HTQ, and for Afghans and West Africans the IES-R achieved best results with respect to convergent validity.

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the psychopathological status and denial of symptoms in a sample of 38 consecutively admitted adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). Method: The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children was used to determine the categorical diagnosis of eating disorder. The anorexic adolescents completed the EAT-40 (Eating Attitude Test) and, on the basis of its score, the sample was dichotomized in a false-negative group (FNG) scoring under 30 and a positive group (PG) scoring over 30. We compared these two subgroups in terms of clinical variables (age of onset and admission, duration of illness prior to admission, diagnosis, BMI) and psychopathology assessed by the CBCL (Child Behaviour Checklist) and the YSR (Youth Self-Report). In order to evaluate the possible role of diagnosis and BMI on the EAT score we also dichotomized the sample with respect to the diagnosis (full vs. partial AN) and to the mean female BMI (≤15 vs. >15). Results: A significant difference was found in terms of duration of illness prior to admission, which was briefer in the FNG. Higher CBCL and YSR values were found in the PG with significant differences in terms of YSR internalizing symptoms. A large amount of significantly positive Pearson's correlations were found between the CBCL and YSR values in the FNG. No significant Pearson's correlations were found between EAT, BMI and diagnosis. Conclusions: The lower CBCL and YSR values in the FNG seem to point out a tendency of this group to deny anxiety and depression as well as an eating pathology; the longer duration of illness prior to admission in the PG seems to support the hypothesis that the PG may be considered to be not so much more disturbed as more aware of its eating attitudes and psychopathology. The nature of denial in anorexic adolescents is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Background: Cyclothymic temperament (which includes mood lability) is common in bipolar II disorder (BP-II). Depressive mixed state (DMX), a major depressive episode (MDE) mixed with intra-episode hypomanic symptoms (3 or more, according to a recently validated definition), was found to be common in BP-II and not uncommon in major depressive disorder (MOD). The study aim was to find the impact of temperamental mood lability (TML) on DMX. Methods: Consecutive 148 BP-II and 117 MDD outpatients presenting for MDE treatment were interviewed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV as modified by Benazzi and Akiskal [J Affect Disord 2003;73:33-38] to reduce the false negative BP-II. Intra- MDE hypomanic symptoms were systematically assessed. Kraepelin, Angst, and Akiskal's definitions of temperamental mood lability (i.e., frequent up and down fluctuations of mood between major mood episodes since young age) were followed. Results: DMX was present in 61.5%, TML in 52.8%. In the DMX sample, TML was present in 57.6%, and in the non-DMX sample TML was present in 45.0% (OR = 1.6, 95% Cl = 1.0-2.7). In the DMX sample, independent predictors of DMX with TML were BP-II and young age at onset. Intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms, and MDE, melancholic and atypical symptoms were not significantly different between DMX patients with TML and DMX patients without TML, apart from more temperamental interpersonal sensitivity in DMX patients with TML (OR = 2.0,95% Cl = 1.0-3.8). Discussion: DMX patients with TML had a younger onset age, suggesting that TML may facilitate the onset of DMX or that it may be a precursor of DMX. The association of BP-II with DMX, TML, and interpersonal sensitivity can make the course of BP-II more unstable and its treatment more complex.

Abstract = {Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among patients seeking care at medical clinics, little is known about the performance of screening instruments for this disorder in these settings. Previous studies of acute trauma populations using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) have suggested that scores of 45-50 provide the best discrimination between cases and noncases. In this study, the PCL was given to 1,225 women (mean age 41.8 yrs) enrolled in an HMO. After interviewing a sample of 261 of these women using a structured, clinician-administered PTSD interview, the authors compared the results of the PCL to the clinician interviews over a range of possible cut scores. The optimum balance of sensitivity and specificity for this population was a score of 30, yielding a sensitivity of .82 and specificity of .76. The positive and negative likelihood ratios for this cut score were 3.40 and 0.24, respectively. By comparison, the use of 45 as a cut score would result in very low sensitivity (.36) in this setting. The lower cut score found in this study may indicate that the use of previously published cut scores of 45-50 may not optimize the function of the PCL as a screening tool outside of acute trauma settings due to an unacceptably high number of false negative cases.

Abstract = {Examined the hypothesis that positive mood facilitates automatic processing and that negative mood facilitates a controlled processing strategy. Subjects (Ss) in Exp 1 were 99 female university students in Japan and in Exp 2 were 36 female university students in Japan. In Exp 1, after a positive or negative mood was induced, Ss rated the attractiveness of products while listening to a music tape which Ss were told would have the effect of inducing positive, negative, or neutral moods. The results showed that an augmentation effect was clearer in the negative mood condition than in the positive mood condition. In Exp 2, Ss were first presented lists of non-famous names of Japanese companies either once or 4 times. Either 1 or 2 days later, Ss were again presented with the same names, presented with new names, and were then asked to judge whether those names were famous or non famous. The results showed that Ss in a positive mood showed more false assessment than those in a negative mood because those in a positive mood did not control their feeling of familiarity correctly. This result indicated that those in positive moods were likely to engage in an automatic processing strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the common characteristics of reasoning in the 2 types of hypothesis testing tasks that contain similar passive information gathering procedures: reception strategy task and hypothesis evaluation task. 20 Ss built their own hypothesis but were not allowed to choose instances to test the hypothesis in the reception strategy task, and 20 different Ss in the hypothesis evaluation task only evaluated a hypothesis generated by another person. In addition, Ss were asked to mark instances that they thought suitable to test the hypothesis on each trial. Results showed that Ss chose negative (-H) tests in the middle or later stage of the task. Otherwise, they chose confirmative tests throughout the task. Two possible interpretations of the results were offered that (1) experiencing the false negative (-H+T) made Ss realize the usefulness of negative testing and (2) there was a phased shift of the selection tendency between the earlier phase of extracting a possible hypothesis to the later phase of refining it.

Linkage methodologies were originally devised to tackle single-gene Mendelian traits. Detractors think this approach is too simplistic to sort out complex inheritance pattern disorders; proponents point to successes in other complex diseases such as diabetes, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's dementia. A major concern in linkage studies of complex disorders is the avoidance of false-positive and false-negative results. Linkage analysis techniques are continuously refined, bolstering their prospects in a wide range of genetic traits by overcoming or minimizing potential errors.

Biased items were created using a 2-dimensional noncompensatory IRT model. The iterative linking and ability scale purification (ILAP) method has shown promise for discerning biased from unbiased items in one simulated unidirectional DIF condition. When applied across a broad range of item bias conditions, ILAP was at times more effective than iterative linking alone, primarily by reducing false negatives and occasionally reducing false positive misidentifications. The choice of significance level employed for detection of DIF influenced the convergence of the ILAP method. The method holds some promise for improving correct classification of test items as biased or unbiased. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Discusses and advocates an approach to the assessment of young children that accounts for identified concerns within the context of the child's life. It is argued that the element most often missing in assessment is contextual information, which is the information that contributes to the ecological validity of the assessment. A case study of a 4.6-yr-old boy referred for a learning and behavioral assessment illustrates false negative and false positive assessment outcomes occurring in decontextualized settings. Omission of significant contextual information created a poor fit between the assessment results and the S's experience in his everyday environments. A contextual assessment practice integrates clinical, observational, and interview assessment information to develop a more holistic, ecological, and representative picture of a child in relation to the contents of his or her everyday life.

Abstract = {Background: Little is known about the prevalence of depression in older patients consulting their general practitioner. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of major and minor depression in older GP attendees. Design: Cross sectional two-stage screening design. Setting: Seventeen GPs in urban and 41 GPs in rural settings. Methods: Data of The West Friesland Study were used. Five thousand, six hundered and eight-six GP attendees of 55 years and older filled in the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 items as a screening instrument for depression (response 62%). Of those screened positive on the GDS-15, 846 (77.5%) were interviewed using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD). A random sample (n = 102) scoring below the threshold of the GDS-15 was interviewed to estimate the proportion of false negatives. Results: Major depression was prevalent in 13.7% and minor depression in 10.2% of the patients. Depressed patients were older (mean difference 0.7 years; p = 0.037), more often female (OR 1.3; p < 0.001) and lived more often in urban districts (OR 1.5; p < 0.001). Patients with major depression were younger (mean difference 1.9 years; p < 0.001) and more often female (OR 1.4; p = 0.026) than those with a minor depression. Only 22.9% of the patients with a major depression were treated with antidepressants. Conclusion: Depression in older GP attendees is a very common health problem. Further research should focus on identifying those groups of patients with high risk of persistence of depression. This could help to focus the limited resources available in general practice to those patients in whom treatment is most urgently needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {The NeuroScreen comprises two easily administered components: the Brief NeuroCognitive Screen (BNCS), designed to estimate the frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive disorders; and the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen (BPNS), for distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) in HIV. In this study, both the NeuroScreen and a more extensive standardized validation neurodiagnostic evaluation were administered to HIV-positive subjects (N=301) enrolled in two large cohort studies at multiple sites. BNCS performance was summarized in the form of a demographically adjusted mean z-score, the NPZ3. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the BNCS as compared to the reference standard neuropsychological (NP) evaluation was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69, 0.79). Using a cut-point of −0.33 on the NPZ3 provided a correct classification rate of 68%, with roughly balanced sensitivity (65%) and specificity (72%). Under the assumption of a 30% prevalence of cognitive impairment, the calculated positive predictive value (PPV) of the BNCS was 86%. Relative to its reference standard, a modified Total Neuropathy Score (TNS) administered by a neurologist, the BPNS gave a similar correct diagnostic classification rate of 78%; sensitivity 49% [95% CI 37%, 60%]; specificity 88% [95% CI 82%,91%]. Under the assumption of a 40% prevalence of DSPN, the PPV of the BPNS was 72%. These predictive values suggest that the NeuroScreen will be useful for tracking trends in the prevalence of HIV-associated neurologic disease in large cohorts in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy. However, because it yields substantial numbers of false positives and negatives, the NeuroScreen may be less useful in evaluating individual patients.

Abstract = {The Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES) is a brief child-friendly measure designed to screen children at risk for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It has good face and construct validity, a stable factor structure, correlates well with other indices of distress, and has been used to screen very large samples of at-risk-children following a wide range of traumatic events. However, few studies have examined the scale's validity against a structured diagnostic interview based on the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. In the present study, the CRIES and the PTSD section of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule--Child and Parent Version (ADIS-CP) were administered to a sample of children and adolescents (n=63) recruited from hospital accident and emergency rooms and the validity of the CRIES as a screening tool evaluated. Cutoff scores were chosen from this sample with a low base-rate of PTSD (11.1%) to maximize sensitivity and minimize the likelihood that children with a diagnosis of PTSD would fail to be identified. Cutoff scores were then cross-validated in a sample of 52 clinically referred children who had a high base-rate of PTSD (67.3%). A cutoff score of 30 on the CRIES-13 and a cutoff score of 17 on the CRIES-8 maximized sensitivity and specificity, minimized the rate of false negatives, and correctly classified 75-83% of the children in the two samples. The CRIES-8 (which lacks any arousal items) worked as efficiently as the CRIES-13 (which includes arousal items) in correctly classifying children with and without PTSD. Results are discussed in light of the current literature and of the need for further development of effective screens for children at-risk of developing PTSD.

Abstract = {Introduction: In 2004, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advised that nasogastric (NG) tube position should be confirmed using pH strips or paper. However, gastric pH is raised by the use of H2-blockers and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) potentially producing false negative pH tests resulting in delayed feeding. In addition, colorimetric differentiation using pH strips may be more prone to bias and inaccuracy than direct pH measurements largely used to establish the threshold. Method: To quantify this problem a 1 day survey of all the patients requiring NG and nasointestinal (NI) feeding was undertaken, to establish the numbers of patients receiving H2-Blockers or PPIs, with or without a safe swallow and the methods currently being used to confirm tube positioning. A second observational study was performed to establish the accuracy of six pH strips available to NHS trusts against four unlabelled pH solutions. Results: Forty-two per cent of patients receiving NG feeding were on H2-blockers or PPIs, including 13% who had a safe swallow for acidic drinks that could be subsequently aspirated to confirm position. In the second study 'testers' correctly identified pH's 3, 4, 5 and 6 with Mackery-Nagel 0-6, BDH 0-6 and 0-14 strips but overestimated pH 4 as pH 5 with Johnson 0-11 paper, underestimated pH 6 as pH 5 with Pehanon 0-12 paper and with Litmus classified pH 3-5 as acid (all), but half also classified pH 6 as acid. Conclusion: Theoretically 29% of NG tube positions could not be confirmed by pH testing because of the usage of PPIs or H2-blockers and lack of swallow. Some pH strips are either inaccurate or their result misinterpreted by staff. Large surveys and trials of the actual efficacy and accuracy of pH testing are required.

Abstract = {Background: When assessing the association between a factor X and a subsequent outcome Y in observational studies, the question that arises is what are the variables to adjust for to reduce bias due to confounding for causal inference on the effect of X on Y. Disregarding such factors is often a source of overestimation because these variables may affect both X and Y. On the other hand, adjustment for such variables can also be a source of underestimation because such variables may be the causal consequence of X and part of the mechanism that leads from X to Y. Methods: In this paper, we present a simple method to compute control variables in the presence of age at onset data on both X and a set of other variables. Using these age at onset data, control variables are computed that adjust only for conditions that occur prior to X. This strategy can be used in prospective as well as in survival analysis. Our method is motivated by an argument based on the counterfactual model of a causal effect. Results: The procedure is exemplified by examining of the relation between panic attack and the subsequent incidence of MDD. Conclusions: The results reveal that the adjustment for all other variables, irrespective of their temporal relation to X, can yield a false negative result (despite unconsidered confounders and other sources of bias).

Abstract = {Background: Data are lacking from representative samples of total populations and Hispanic Americans on the association of cigarette smoking and religiousness/spirituality, a protective factor for mortality, and on the validity of self-reported smoking data for religious research. Methods: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) included 18,774 persons aged 20 years and over with complete data on self-reported frequency of attendance at religious services, and cigarette smoking. Results: After stratifying by age, gender, and ethnic group, and adjusting for age, education, region, and health status, infrequent attenders (<24 times/year) were much more likely to be smokers than frequent attenders; odds ratios (95% confidence limits) ranged from 1.74 (1.45-2.10) to 3.06 (1.86-5.03). Among current smokers, frequent attenders smoked an average of 1-5 fewer cigarettes per day. Using serum cotinine ≥14 ng/mL as the gold standard for current smoking, under-reporting of smoking did not vary appreciably with frequency of attendance: false negative percentage for never smokers 3.1% in frequent attenders, 4.2% in others. Conclusions: Greater frequency of attendance at religious services was associated with lower smoking prevalence by self-report or serum cotinine in a national, multi-ethnic sample.

Abstract = {Objective: Jails have a substantial legal obligation to provide health and mental health care for inmates; yet screening procedures across American jails are highly variable. Currently, no valid, practical, standardized tool is available. The study reported here sought to validate a revision of the Referral Decision Scale (RDS)--the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS)--which provides an even briefer and more practical tool for use in jails. Methods: Valid BJMHS data were collected in four jails (two in Maryland and two in New York) from 10,330 detainees. A total of 357 detainees were also administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for standardized clinical cross-validation: 125 detainees (74 men and 51 women) who were classified as referrals for further mental health assessment on the basis of BJMHS and 232 detainees (137 men and 95 women) who were not classified as referrals. Results: The BJMHS takes an average of 2.5 minutes to administer. It correctly classified 73.5 percent of males but only 61.6 percent of females on the basis of SCID diagnoses. Overall, the BJMHS identified 11.3 percent of screened detainees for further mental health assessment. Conclusions: The BJMHS is a practical, efficient tool that jail correction officers can give male detainees on intake screening. However, the screen has an unacceptably high false-negative rate for female detainees. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the ability of cardiovascular healthcare workers to assess the presence or absence of symptoms of depression in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the absence of formal screening. Methods: Patients admitted with AMI underwent screening using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) administered by a research assistant. The cardiovascular nurse, medicine resident or intern, and attending cardiologist caring for the patient were then approached (blinded to the BDI results) and asked to assess, using a visual analog scale, whether the patient had symptoms that would warrant further evaluation for depression. Results: BDI screening and at least one provider assessment were completed for 60 patients with AMI. A total of 18 of 60 patients (30.0%) had a BDI score of ≥10. Symptoms of depression were considered not present in 24 of 32 patient assessments when the BDI was ≥10 (75% false-negatives). The mean BDI score of patients assessed as depressed by at least one provider (6.7 ± 6.3) was no different from the mean BDI score of patients assessed as not depressed (7.5 ± 7.2, p = .67). Overall, there was little correlation between BDI scores and provider assessments, and this was not influenced by provider type or provider gender. Conclusions: Cardiovascular nurses and medicine residents and interns underrecognize depression in patients with AMI in the absence of formal screening. Formal screening for symptoms of depression should be considered part of routine AMI care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Aims: To assess if cannabis use is a risk factor for future psychotic symptoms, and vice versa, in adolescents and young adults from the general population. Design: Cohort study. Setting/participants: Zuid Holland study, a 14-year follow-up study of 1580 initially 4-16-year-olds who were drawn randomly from the Dutch general population. Because cannabis use is generally condoned in the Netherlands, false-negative reports of cannabis use may occur less frequently than in countries with stricter drug policies, which supports the value of the present study. Measurements: Life-time cannabis use and psychotic symptoms, assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Findings: Cannabis use, in individuals who did not have psychotic symptoms before they began using cannabis, predicted future psychotic symptoms (hazard ratio = 2.81; 95% confidence interval = 1.79-4.43). However, psychotic symptoms in those who had never used cannabis before the onset of psychotic symptoms also predicted future cannabis use (hazard ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval = 1.13-2.5 7). Conclusions: The results imply either a common vulnerability with varying order of onset or a bi-directional causal relationship between cannabis use and psychosis. More research on patterns and timings of these relationships is needed to narrow down the possibilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the agreement between parental reporting of development of children born very preterm using the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) questionnaire and professional assessment by a paediatric developmental team in the detection of sensorineural disability. Methods: A cross-sectional cohort study of 362 children born in Queensland with a birthweight ≤1250 g. who were surviving at 2 and 4 years of age corrected for prematurity, was conducted. Parents completed the PEDS questionnaire prior to their child receiving a neurodevelopmental assessment. The level of agreement for sensorineural disability between the neurodevelopmental assessment and the parents' score on the PEDS questionnaire was measured using the kappa statistic, and screening test characteristics were calculated. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors that might affect agreement. Results: Two hundred and eighty-three (78%) of the eligible children were located and contacted. Of these, 216 (76%) agreed to participate in the study (110, 2-year-olds; 106, 4-year-olds). Agreement between the two forms of rating sensorineural disability (developmental quotient > -2SD (standard deviation), cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness and deafness requiring aids) for the 4-year age group children was fair (κ = 0.27, P = 0.001). PEDS accurately identified 69% (11 of 16) of disabled children and 72% (65 of 90) non-disabled children. The test characteristics for these children were similar to Glascoe's norming sample with a PPV 31% (95% CI: 14-48%), specificity 72% (95% CI: 62-81%), but lower sensitivity 69% (95% CI: 62-81%) and higher false-negative rate 31 % (95% CI: 11,59). Agreement for the 2-year age group was fair with poor test characteristics. Other comparisons for both age groups (PEDS A and B compared using a disability status with DQ > -1SD) showed poor agreement and test characteristics. Gestation age <27 weeks and maternal education at or below grade 10 in the 2-year age group were the only factors independently affecting agreement. Conclusions: The agreement between parental evaluation of sensorineural disability status using PEDS and paediatrics developmental assessment in children born very preterm at 4-years corrected age for prematurity compares favourably with Glascoe's norming sample. The lower agreement seen in the 2-year age group limits the utility of PEDS to be used as a screen for disability at an age when early intervention may be useful. The PEDS questionnaire is designed and normed for the general paediatric population, and it is not clear if parents of children born very preterm may have interpreted the PEDS questionnaire in relation to their satisfaction with their child's developmental progress rather than their child's functional ability.

Abstract = {Objectives: To compare the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) methods for detecting delirium in alert, nonintubated older ICU patients. Design: Comparison study. Settings: Fourteen-bed medical ICU of an 800-bed university teaching hospital. Participants: Twenty-two patients aged 65 and older admitted to the ICU. Measurements: Two blinded, trained clinician-researchers who had undergone interrater reliability testing interviewed patients separately, usually within 10 minutes of each other (up to 120 minutes). Each researcher examined patients for the four key CAM criteria: acuteness, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. One researcher used the CAM method with the Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Span; the other researcher used the CAM-ICU method with nonverbal cognitive and attention tasks. Results: Rates of delirium were 68% according to CAM and 50% according CAM-ICU. Comparing the two methods, agreement was 82%, with a kappa of 0.64. Using the CAM as the reference standard, the CAM-ICU had a sensitivity of 73% (95% confidence interval (CI)=60-86) and specificity of 100% (95% CI=56-100). There were four false-negative ratings using the CAM-ICU. Reasons for disparate results were that the CAM used more-detailed cognitive testing that detected more deficits (3 patients) and the time elapsed (90 minutes) between ratings in one patient with markedly fluctuating symptoms. Conclusion: CAM and CAM-ICU agreement was moderately high. Although the CAM-ICU is recommended for ICU patients because of its brevity and ease of use, the standard CAM method may detect more subtle cases of delirium in nonintubated, verbal ICU patients.

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the MEAMS (Golding, 1989) for detecting cognitive impairment after stroke. Stroke patients admitted to hospital received a cognitive screening assessment, the MEAMS, and a detailed cognitive assessment. The information obtained from the detailed assessment was summarised in a structured written report. From the conclusions in these reports, patients were classified as "impaired" or "not impaired" in perception, memory, executive function and language. The sensitivity and specificity of the MEAMS subtests and the overall number of tests passed were determined in relation to the presence of impairment, as given in the overall conclusion of the written reports. There were 30 stroke patients, aged 58 to 92 (mean 75.80, SD 7.94) years. Of these, 17 were men and 13 were women. The sensitivity of the MEAMS subtests ranged from 11% to 100% and the specificity ranged from 69% to 100%. The sensitivity of the overall MEAMS score was 52% and the specificity was 100%, using a cut-off score of 3 or more fails to indicate impairment. Three subtests, Orientation, Naming and Unusual views had 81% sensitivity and 50% specificity for detecting problems in language, perception or memory. The MEAMS was not a sensitive screen for overall cognitive impairment or for memory, perceptual, language, or executive function problems after stroke, but it was specific. Although screening for cognitive impairment is important, the MEAMS is not recommended as the sole method, as it produces an unacceptably high false negative rate. Three subtests (Orientation, Naming and Unusual views) had 81% sensitivity and 50% specificity for detecting cognitive problems in language, perception or memory after stroke.

Abstract = {Aims: This study examined the association between the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). Methodology: A questionnaire including the MDI was sent out to an adult population and was completed by a total of 10,448 persons. Psychiatrists used SCAN and interviewed a subsample (n=1093). Results: The specificity of the MDI was 0.22, the sensitivity 0.67 and Kappa 0.25 when Major Depression according to SCAN was considered as the index of validity, and with all depressive disorders the specificity was 0.44, the sensitivity 0.51 and Kappa 0.33. Higher educated persons and those with reported disability were less likely to be false negatives. The sensitivity and specificity for different cut-off scores when using the MDI total score were calculated. Conclusion: The result from this study suggests that, when MDI is used in population-based samples, cut-off scores rather than the algorithm for depression should be used. The optimal cut-off score must be chosen according to the aims of the study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Comments on the article of C. J. Vas et al (see record [rid]2002-02920-005[/rid]), which examined the prevalence of dementia in an urban population residing in India. Despite its title, this report cannot be considered to have provided an estimate of the prevalence of dementia in the population studied. The employed screening instrument did not include a sufficient number of randomly selected screen-negative Ss to estimate a false-negative rate. Further, the study was highly inefficient in including individuals aged 40-65 yrs, rather than including only those aged 65+ yrs. Other shortcomings include possible cultural bias in the method and a limited scope of dementia diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Determined the efficacy of the combined use of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) and the Early Detection of Alcohol Consumption (EDAC) test to assess drinking in 187 males drinking an average of 20 drinks per day. Heavy drinkers (n = 138) and light drinkers (n = 49) were analysed using the EDAC and CDT tests alone and in combination. The EDAC generates a score and its associated probability value that translates into the likelihood of each individual being a heavy or a light drinker. CDT uses ion-exchange chromatography to extract CDT in the serum and quantifies it by radioimmunoassay. The EDAC alone showed 88% sensitivity rate when identifying heavy drinking males and 98% specificity rate when assessing light drinkers. The CDT test alone showed a sensitivity rate of 58% and a corresponding specificity rate of 96%. In parallel, 92% of heavy drinkers showed abnormal EDAC and/or CDT tests and 94% of light drinkers were negative for both tests. Sequentially, the CDT test confirmed 61% of the heavy drinkers identified by the EDAC test. Specificity rate for this testing strategy was 100%, because the only false positives for EDAC tested negative for CDT. EDAC and CDT may react independently to alcohol intake and can be combined for maximum diagnostic accuracy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Gate questions are commonly used to shorten structured interviews, by not probing negative responses with more detailed questions. This study quantified cases of aborted suicide attempts that would have been missed, if detailed questions following a gate had been skipped. To accomplish this, the authors interviewed a random sample of 135 adult psychiatric inpatients concerning their past suicidal behavior. Using a structured interview, Ss were asked a general question about aborted suicide attempts, and then asked method-specific questions regardless of their response to the general "gate" question. Of the 70 Ss who were found to have histories of aborted attempts, 44.3% answered "no" to the gate question. Comparing these "false negative" Ss to "true positives," who had answered "yes" to the gate question and reported bona fide aborted attempts yielded no significant associations with demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, or reported histories of actual suicide attempts. Thus, a large number of Ss with aborted attempts would have been missed if a negative response to the gate question had not been probed. Clinical and research implications generally, as well as implications for suicide assessment, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Assesses the current state and findings of research on clinical and other evaluations of dangerousness. It is argued that the focus that has existed on determining the false-positive and false-negative rates of predictions of violence may be fundamentally misplaced. Clinical evaluations of dangerousness should be viewed as assessments of risk rather than as predictions of violence; future research should focus on understanding and evaluating how clinical assessments of dangerousness (regarding truly representative types of possibly dangerous patients) are (or should be) made. The research to date on clinical assessments of dangerousness cannot properly be taken to conflict with the Supreme Court's affirmations of the admissibility of such assessments in courtroom proceedings.

With 312 preschool children assessed during the 1st semester and at the end of kindergarten, the relationship between test scores and failing or passing 1st grade was similar. The average hit rate was 84%, the test's sensitivity was 23%, and its specificity was 97%. The test showed almost a 7:1 ratio for misclassifying false positives and false negatives. Since there was no marked difference between the predictive validity of the test on the 2 occasions, it would seem advantageous to give the test in the 1st semester to have time to remedy difficulties during kindergarten.

Abstract = {Assessed the use of a standardized-patient-based postclerkship examination (PCX) to predict 202 medical students' performances in their 1st year of residency. The PCX was more sensitive than specific in that it identified more correctly Ss who received high ratings in their 1st year of residency than those who received low ratings. Analyses of the supervisors' written comments on Ss' performances indicated that more than half of the false positives and false negatives resulted mostly from problems found with the supervisors' ratings, rather than from the inaccuracy of the PCX in predicting Ss' residency performances. Results suggest that the standardized-patient-based PCX is a useful indicator of students' readiness for and performance in residency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Discusses a type of resistance that occurs in analysis with certain narcissistic patients: It is different from overt lies but masks negative transference in a false appearance of meaningfulness. Illustrating his theme with 5 clinical vignettes and quotations from different authors, the author argues that these Ss, through the seduction of attributing false meanings to the material that emerges in analysis, manipulate the analyst's thinking process to avoid really new experiences and to preserve the destruction (for the analytic process) delusion that nothing helpful can come from the analyst unless the patients have omnisciently put it there before. The resulting analysis thus makes sense without bringing any change. A short story by Argintine writer J. L. Borges (1899–1986) is quoted for relevant insights.

Abstract = {Examines the epidemiologic theory of screening as it applies to low prevalence disorders, such as schizophrenia, in order to identify the tasks required for primary and secondary prevention. The author reviews principles of screening, computation of prevented fraction for varying sensitivities, specificities and prevalences of disease, and reviews prevalence of schizophrenia in Australian general practice. It is suggested that there is no currently available efficient method of screening for schizophrenia or for prodromal symptoms. From the genesis of disease to eventual outcome, the milestones that are passed in the case of schizophrenia are uncertain in their nature and the intervening time periods are of uncertain and possibly varying duration. The extent of false positives and negatives in low prevalence disorders is high unless the specificity is very high. It may be feasible to screen for behaviors that are precursors to schizophrenia; however, screening depends upon the existence of a reliable screening instrument that can be shown to discriminate accurately between diseased and disease-free individuals. Development of a method for screening requires comparison against formal clinical assessment of both screen positives and screen negatives.

Abstract = {Scalp recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the neural activity elicited by emotionally negative and emotionally neutral words (NWs) in 16 Ss during the performance of a recognition memory task. Behaviorally, the principal difference between the 2 word classes was that the false alarm rate for negative items was approximately double that for the neutral words. Correct recognition of NWs was associated with 3 topographically distinct ERP memory 'old/new' effects: an early, bilateral, frontal effect which is hypothesized to reflect familiarity-driven recognition memory; a subsequent left parietally distributed effect thought to reflect recollection of the prior study episode; and a late onsetting, right-frontally distributed effect held to be a reflection of post-retrieval monitoring. The old/new effects elicited by negative words were qualitatively indistinguishable from those elicited by neutral items and, in the case of the early frontal effect, of equivalent magnitude also. However, the left parietal effect for negative words was smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration than that elicited by NWs, whereas the right frontal effect was not evident in the ERPs to negative items.

Abstract = {Assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for chronic pain within the context of a methodological review of MEDLINE (published from 1966 to 1999), 2 complementary medicine databases, 69 conference proceedings, and the bibliographies of other articles and reviews. Of the 51 studies which met the inclusion criteria, results were positive in 21 studies, negative in 3 and neutral in 27. Three-fourths of the studies received a low-quality score and these trials were significantly associated with positive results. High-quality studies clustered in designs using sham acupuncture as the control group, where the risk of false negative (type II) errors is high due to large sample size requirements. Six or more acupuncture treatments were significantly associated with positive outcomes even after adjusting for study quality. In conclusion, there is limited evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for chronic pain; and inconclusive evidence that acupuncture is more effective than placebo, sham acupuncture or standard care. However, there is an important relationship between the methodology of the studies and their results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reflects on the extraordinary explosion in the last decades of belated narratives by Holocaust survivors bearing witness to the individual and collective tragedies of European Jews caught in the Shoah. Psychic and social catastrophes, of which the Shoah remains the paradigm, destroy the intermediary arrangements destined to rule the relations between individuals and groups. What the author calls the "ideology of memory," (or the duty to remember) can be considered one of these intermediary arrangements. The author examines here under which conditions the duty to remember functions as a "narcissistic pact," restoring a certain continuity to identity, or, on the contrary, as a negative pact, resulting in a false restoration of the bonds damaged by the catastrophe. In Western thought, the word "ideology" generally bears a negative connotation. Especially for psychoanalysts, adhering to an ideology is suspect since they are supposed to help free their patients from alienating identifications.

By assuming independence of REs at different points in time, estimates for REs are obtained from panel data. While the frequency of false negatives (FNs) may be larger than that of false positives (FPs), the latter may produce large errors in prevalence estimates, particularly if the prevalence rate is small. The precision of estimates of prevalence and incidence rates may vary from substance to substance. In the case of common drugs, errors may not be dramatic and may counteract each other. For rare drugs, though, FPs may have a larger effect than FNs. Surveys likely overestimate the prevalence of uncommon drugs. Biased samples may counteract this effect, but it is difficult to know if this tendency is strong enough to balance the effect of false responses.

This suggests that many tests and measures considered to have adequate validity (between .60 and .90) often will have limited utility in making diagnostic, placement, or treatment decisions.

Abstract = {Outcome measures for smoking cessation are reviewed and evaluated, including 3 self-report and 3 biochemical-validation measures. Point prevalence reflects the percentage of participants taking action, prolonged abstinence reflects those in the maintenance stage, and continuous abstinence reflects those who progress from action to maintenance without lapsing or relapsing. Biochemical assessments are primarily measures of point prevalence abstinence. The desirability of biochemical validation is a particularly controversial and critical issue. Three factors affect the accuracy of self-report: type of population, type of intervention, and demand characteristics. False-negative rates are generally low. Three broad issues impact on decisions to use biochemical-validation: (1) alternative explanations for false positives, (2) refusal rate problems, and (3) the effect of inaccuracy on intervention assessment.

Abstract = {Reviewed conceptual and methodological issues of mirror self-exploration research in nonhuman primates. The authors conclude that: (1) mirror self-exploration provides evidence for mirror self-recognition; (2) inter- and intraspecies differences in terms of presence or absence of mirror self-recognition are not yet sufficiently clear, that is, whether its absence in species and individuals is methodological (false negative with respect to trait) or ontological (true negative with respect to trait) in nature; and (3) proposals of hypotheses to account phylogenetically for the existence of inter- and intraspecies differences in mirror self-recognition are premature. The authors suggest that before hypotheses such as these are advanced, the impact of rearing conditions on mirror self-recognition should be examined further.

Abstract = {A battery of tests presumed to assess various frontal lobe functions in children was evaluated for the accuracy of the tests in classifying children as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two groups of children were tested: (1) 66 children, aged 6–11 yrs, with ADHD, and (2) a normal community control group of 64 children of the same age. Results indicate good positive predictive power for 7 of the tests (ranging from 80 to 90%), suggesting that abnormal scores on these tests may be indicative of the presence of ADHD. However, the rates of negative predictive power even for these 7 tests were modest (ranging from 50 to 66%). Sensitivity was also poor (ranging from 5 to 43%) as were the levels of false negatives (averaging 40%) creating fair-to-poor overall classification rates for all tests (49 to 70%). It is concluded that while these neuropsychological tests may have some value in clinical evaluations of children's psychological abilities, they may not be useful as the sole criteria for the diagnostic classification of children as ADHD.

Abstract = {Aim: To investigate an association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) C270T polymorphism and schizophrenia in a Chinese Han population. Methods: One hundred and thirty physically healthy inpatients (80 men and 50 women) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, were compared with unrelated 144 healthy controls (92 men and 52 women). All patients were of the chronic type with a mean duration of illness of 21.2 ± 9.9 years. All subjects were Han Chinese. The C270T polymorphism was genotyped which was carried out blind to the clinical status and was performed in duplicate. Results: The results indicate that, for our Chinese sample, the C270T polymorphism of the BDNF may not be involved in susceptibility to schizophrenia. However, our failure to demonstrate a significant association may reflect false negative results due to the small sample size and the low statistical power.

Abstract = {Discusses the problems of errors in offending report data. A latent class model (L. A. Goodman, 1974) was adapted to yield estimates of both the magnitude of errors in report data and estimates of the prevalence of offending in 729 12-yr-old New Zealand children. A 2 indicator (IN) model showed that in 12.5% of the cases, children reported offending but not their mothers, while in 5.6% the mother reported that the child had offended but the child failed to report any offense. The 2 IN model is limited as (1) it assumes that false positive responding does not occur and (2) it cannot be tested using goodness of fit methods. A 3 IN model estimating false positive and false negative responding showed that there was a strong tendency for offending to be underreported, a slight tendency for children who were nonoffenders to report falsely offending, and that about 30% of children had offended in the previous year.

Among 250 psychiatric patients (aged 18+ yrs), the CAST exhibited substantial item-total scale correlations and a high level of internal consistency reliability. The CAST also correlated significantly with measures of alcohol and drug use. Total CAST scores discriminated self-identified children of problem drinkers from Ss whose parents did not have drinking problems and were significantly correlated with the severity of parental psychological and social complications due to alcohol misuse. Factor analysis indicated a unidimensional scale structure, and CAST cut-off scores produced a low false positive and false negative rate.

The interrater reliability for the DES scoring procedure was excellent. The test–retest reliability of DES scores was also excellent, which suggests that DES total scores are temporally stable and similar in absolute value across testings. The internal consistency of DES scores was very high. Both MPD and DDNOS Ss earned significantly higher DES scores than did students. MPD Ss earned significantly higher DES scores than DDNOS Ss. A DES cut-off score of 45–55 will maximize the probability of correctly classifying normal Ss from dissociative disorder patients while minimizing the rates of false positive and false negative errors.

Abstract = {The disease construction of schizophrenia (SZ) originated during a period of rapid growth of biological science based on mechanistic principles. Crude diagnostic measures failed to differentiate absurd, unwanted conduct due to biological conditions from atypical conduct directed to solving existential or identity problems. The patient came to be regarded as an object without agency or goals. In spite of enormous research funding, no biological or psychological marker has been discovered that would differentiate diagnosed SZs from normals without creating unacceptable proportions of false positives and false negatives. It is concluded that SZ is an obsolescent hypothesis and should be abandoned. An alternate framework, contextualism, is discussed in which persons are perceived as agents, actors, or performers.

Abstract = {Investigated whether antipsychotics were able to reverse a prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficit in male Wistar rats. The authors tested the effects of intraperitoneal/ly (ip) treatment with haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, remoxipride, olanzapine and sertindole, the adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin, the dopamine D₁ receptor antagonist SCH23390, and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 2A/C antagonist ritanserin. The PPI deficit can be reversed by some (clozapine, olanzipine, and sertindole) but not other (risperidone, remoxipride, and haloperidol) antipsychotic drugs. The 3 false negatives suggest that this deficit of PPI reversal procedure will not be a good indicator of potential antipsychotic activity. In an attempt to investigate the mechanism that might underlie the reversing effect of clozapine, olanzapine, and sertindole, the authors tested the ability of prazosin, SCH 23390 and ritanserin to reverse the PPI deficit. Negative results with these 3 drugs did not allow the authors to characterize the receptors that might be implicated in the reversal of this type of PPI deficit.

Abstract = {Recurrent Brief Depressive Disorder (RED) is a well-defined and prevalent mood disorder with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and significant clinical impairment in the community and general practice. Occurring at least monthly with depressive episodes lasting only a few days defines recurrent Brief Depressive Disorder. The lifetime co-occurrence of both RED and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), called Combined Depression (CD), substantially increases the risk for attempted suicide, even more than that known for 'pure' MDD. The diagnostic criteria for RBD found in the ICD-10 and DSM-IV are helpful in research and clinical routine as well as several methodological issues, which make clinical diagnostic and drug response evaluation of RBD very different from MDD. Formal differences in the course of RBD and MDD require different designs for drug treatment studies. Denials of disorder, specific methodological requirements, and highly selected patient samples have probably been responsible for false negative results in double blind, placebo-controlled treatment studies. Although several authors reported successful treatment of RBD with different compounds in about 60 patients, it is still not possible to deduce a treatment algorithm for RBD to date. Obviously future treatment studies without the limitations of previous studies are clearly required for RBD. Results of ongoing studies will soon provide the first data on the biological underpinnings of RBD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {The present study validated a brief at-risk screening instrument designed for easy use by teachers in the elementary school. School performance measures were collected for students in first to sixth grade one year following initial teacher ratings using the Screening For At-Risk Status screening instrument. Findings indicated that the instrument is best seen as measuring a single at-risk construct with items drawn from three domains: academic skills, social confidence, and social cooperation. Correlations between at-risk scores and school performance measures taken one year later demonstrated predictive validity. The screening instrument correctly identified at-risk students with 88% accuracy and not-at-risk students with 74% accuracy. There were 12% false negatives. Use of the instrument provides teachers with a quick, easy screening of students who may develop difficulties in the future. For schools, the screening can be used as the first step in a supportive response system to assist at-risk students from developing serious school difficulties and possibly failure in the longer term.

Abstract = {Objectives: Asperger's Syndrome is a disorder of uncertain nosological validity, which is difficult to differentiate from high-functioning autism. Even today these disorders are unfortunately diagnosed very late, often in the wake of earlier, different diagnoses. The purpose of this study is to present a screening instrument (MBAS), which is sensitive to these disorders. Methods: The instrument was tested among a total of 91 probands (44 of whom had been diagnosed as autistic, and 47 of whom had been diagnosed with a non-autistic disorder). Results: The items on the MBAS were of average difficulty; generally, the all item-total correlation was good. The total scale has an internal consistency of Cronbach's alpha = .91 and the convergent validity of the MBAS and the ADI-R reached r = .61 (p = .001). The total score of the questionnaire discriminated highly significantly between the group with autism and that without. At a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 95.7% the number of misclassifications is low. False negative classifications occurred only in the case of very young children. Conclusions: The MBAS is a reliable and valid instrument for screening and generating tentative diagnoses of high-functioning autism. The questionnaire is well suited for the selection and generation of tentative diagnoses of autism on a high-functioning level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Social-learning models of drug motivation and relapse often include the constructs of affect and drug expectancies. Most research has taken a molar approach to examining relations between these constructs and level of drug use. An experiment examined the roles of affect and expectancies in multiple measures of situation-specific motivation to smoke tobacco. Undergraduate smokers (n = 101) received either a positive or negative mood manipulation (false feedback on an intelligence test). Self-reported urge was influenced by both negative affect and expectancies for positive reinforcement from smoking. Actual consumption was related only to smoking expectancies and only among abstaining smokers. affect by expectancy interactions were also found. Findings support a limited role of affect and expectancies in smoking motivation. Poor coherence among the motivational indexes challenges the assumptions of existing models of drug motivation.

Abstract = {Objectives: To review the characteristics of psychiatric screening tools currently available in addiction treatment services for rapid assessment of comorbid pathology and to introduce the Centre for Addictions and Mental Health Concurrent Disorders Screener (CAMH-CDS), a computer-administered questionnaire that screens for the occurrence of 11 Axis I disorders plus all substance use disorders, as well as for a history of conduct disorder. Methods: We describe the structure, contents, and application of the CAMH-CDS. We undertook a sensitivity and specificity trial involving 171 subjects, a test-retest reliability study with 301 participants, and an open-label concordance study with 656 respondents. All subjects were regular clients of a major addiction treatment facility. Results: The CAMH-CDS was easily and effectively used by addiction counsellors with limited or no mental health training. It has a low rate of false-negative responses, and it yields excellent test-retest reliability figures. It is highly sensitive to identifying persons with psychiatric disturbances; however, its ability to discriminate among specific disorders appears to be more limited. Conclusions: The CAMH-CDS can be reliably used to rule out the presence of psychiatric comorbidity in addiction service populations. As with other psychiatric screening instruments, its sensitivity values are stronger than its specificity values. The use of nonstructured clinical evaluations as the gold standard for diagnosis and a likely variance in the patients' symptom reports between the 2 examinations may have contributed to the latter finding.

Abstract = {Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) are tests widely used for screening and diagnosis of autism. This study verified their correspondence and conflict with a diagnosis made with DSM-IV criteria. The sample consisted of 65 children, aged 18 months to 11 years. We found complete agreement between DSM-IV and CARS. We show that ABC does not distinguish individuals with autistic disorders from other cases of developmental disorders as well as CARS: the number of false negatives is high (46%) with ABC as opposed to 0% with CARS.

Abstract = {Verbal fluency tests are commonly used in neurocognitive and mental status examinations in patients with suspected dementia. Inflation of test scores as a result of practice effects may yield false-negative results in test-retest and multidisciplinary settings, particularly among patients with mild cognitive deficits. To address this issue, animal naming was administered twice within a 1-week period to a group of individuals referred for suspected dementia who were ultimately diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; amnestic form), probable Alzheimer disease (AD), or no dementia. A 2 × 3 repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant interaction between administration time and group. Post hoc analyses indicated that nondemented controls were the only group to demonstrate a significant practice effect, producing an average of approximately three more animal names at time two. Like patients with a diagnosis of AD, subjects with amnestic MCI failed to benefit from repeated exposure to the animal naming test, and only controls showed an average improvement upon retest. This underscores the cognitive similarity between individuals diagnosed with amnestic MCI and AD and suggests that improvement upon retest may be a diagnostically useful finding.

Abstract = {Reviews the book "Bad Feelings: Selected Psychoanalytic Essays," by Roy Schafer (see record [rid]2003-06906-000[/rid]). The author introduces a subject that is as simple and complex as the title of this book: the all-too-common yet most difficult of clinical problems, namely the 'bad feelings' that arise for myriad reasons in our patients. The fact is that, for many people, the closest they can get to verbalizing their emotional state is 'I feel bad; I feel like shit'. Where do we go from there? It is apparent to most practitioners that 'I feel bad; I feel like shit' is no simple expression of 'badness' but covers a vast range of topics including joylessness; disappointment and disappointedness; shame, humiliation and mortification; envy; defences against goodness; termination; false depressive positions; the negative therapeutic reaction. And the author bravely tackles each of these in turn. Each of the chapters in this book is worthy of applause. One small quibble would be that at times it felt almost too straightforward and worked through - the messiness and sloppiness of everyday analytic work having been duly edited out and cleaned up, which can leave the reader-clinician feeling both determined to 'do better', but also feeling clumsy and inept.

Abstract = {Psychological assessments of competency-to-stand-trial (CST) referrals must consider whether the defendants' impairment is genuine or feigned. This study addressed feigning on the Evaluation of Competency to Stand Trial--Revised (ECST-R), a standardized interview designed for assessing dimensions of CST and screening for feigned CST. In particular, this study examined the effectiveness of the ECST-R's Atypical Presentation (ATP) scales as screens for feigned incompetency. It examined ATP scales for (a) jail detainees (n=96) in simulation and control conditions and (b) inpatient competency cases (n=56) in clinical comparison and probable malingering groups. Comparisons of ATP scales yielded very large effect sizes for feigners when compared with jail controls (mean d=2.50) and genuine inpatient competency cases (mean d=1.83). Several cut scores were established with very few false negatives and robust sensitivity estimates. In summary, the ECST-R ATP scales appear to be homogenous scales with established clinical use as feigning screens in CST evaluations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of the needs of all high security psychiatric hospital (HSPH) patients in England has not previously been conducted. All inpatients in the three HSPHs in England (Ashworth, Broadmoor and Rampton, n=1256) were assessed. Factors associated with placement need were modelled using logistic regression, then cluster analysis was used to identify patient subgroups on the basis of their individual needs. Forty percent of the patients could be transferred out of high security, according to the RMOs. While it was possible to identify factors associated with the continued need for high security the false negative rate was high. Patients had very diverse needs that did not fit neatly into clustered subgroups. Due to the heterogeneity of the individual patients currently in the HSPHs, future service planning will need to focus on individualized treatment packages that are based on individual assessments of need. Such assessments should be considered in the wider framework of risk and accountability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Color codes in VDT displays often contain sets of colors that are confusing to individuals with color-vision deficiencies. The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with color-vision deficiencies (color defectives) can perform as well as individuals without color-vision deficiencies (color normals) on a colored VDT display used in the railway industry and to determine whether clinical color-vision tests can predict their performance. Of the 52 color defectives, 58% failed the VDT test. The kappa coefficients of agreement for the Farnsworth D-15, Adams desaturated D-15, and Richmond 3rd Edition HRR PIC diagnostic plates were significantly greater than chance. In particular, the D-15 tests have a high probability of predicting who fails the practical test. However, all three tests had an unacceptably high false-negative rate (9.5-35%); so that a practical test is still needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {This study examined the effect of scoring method, education, and language usage on internal consistency of the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Trained bilingual staff administered the MMSE in participants' homes as part of the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging home-based assessment battery. Subjects included 833 community-dwelling Mexican-American (MA) and European-American (EA) elders, aged 65 and older, residing in three socioculturally distinct neighborhoods in San Antonio, Texas. Three methods of scoring the MMSE were examined: serial sevens only, spelling only, and serial sevens or spelling, whichever was higher. Mean MMSE scores ± standard deviation ranged from 27.7 ± 2.4 to 28.5 ± 1.9 for EAs, from 25.6 ± 3.2 to 27.2 ± 2.9 for MAs interviewed in English, and from 22.5 ± 4.5 to 25.5 ± 3.5 for MAs interviewed in Spanish, depending on scoring method. Across the three ethnic-language subgroups, the lowest mean scores, largest coefficients of variation, and highest alpha coefficients were observed using serial sevens only. Stratification by educational level showed that alpha coefficients for all three scoring methods were consistently lower in high school graduates than in less-educated groups. Serial sevens only was the only scoring method that yielded acceptably high alpha coefficients across all ethnic, language, and education subgroups. Thus, clinicians should use the serial sevens-only method when administering the MMSE and be alert to the increased potential for false-negatives in more highly educated EA and MA elders, particularly in EAs and MAs proficient in English.

Abstract = {This prospective longitudinal study was designed to investigate the relationship between acute stress disorder (ASD) and the subsequent development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a population of severely injured hospitalised trauma survivors. Symptoms of ASD were assessed just prior to discharge in 307 consecutive admissions to a Level 1 Trauma Centre, with PTSD assessments completed at 3 and 12 months post-injury. Only 1% of the sample met criteria for an ASD diagnosis (at a mean of 8 days post-injury), while the incidence of PTSD was 9% at 3 months and 10% at 12 months. Although all ASD symptom clusters contributed to the prediction of subsequent PTSD severity, logistic regression indicated that only re-experiencing and arousal predicted a categorical PTSD diagnosis. The dissociative symptoms that form the core of ASD were rarely endorsed and showed high specificity but low sensitivity, resulting in a high proportion of false negative diagnoses. Reducing the number of dissociative symptoms required for a diagnosis ameliorated, but did not resolve, the problem. In this particular population, the low sensitivity of the ASD diagnosis renders it a poor screening test for use in identifying high risk individuals for early intervention and prevention strategies.

Abstract = {To better detect depression in the elderly, the authors explored the relative efficiency of applying the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and Brief Assessment Schedule Depression Cards at recommended (5/6 and 6/7) and higher (7/8 and 8/9) cut-points. Ss were 61 patients (aged 65 yrs and over) admitted to a general hospital who were screened for depression. Findings show that, compared to the traditional cut-point, a higher cut-point on a depression screening instrument identifies older medical inpatients with more enduring depressive symptoms and a longer length of hospital stay. The results provide evidence that a higher cut-point will increase efficiency: Fewer false positives were detected but half of the true positives were still cases that would have otherwise been missed. The disadvantage of using a higher cut-point is that the number of false negatives will increase. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Following exposure to 30 4-digit numbers containing an invariant "3," 56 Ss were found to recognize falsely novel 4-digit numbers containing this invariant (positives) in preference to novel numbers that did not contain the invariant (negatives). Despite this false recognition, they were generally unable to report the rule relating test positives to the positives seen during the learning phase. This finding has been taken to show implicit learning of a rule. Most of the effect can be explained in terms of the rejection of particularly distinctive test items that are more prevalent in the test negatives. This rejection appears to be mediated by knowledge that is potentially explicit as opposed to implicit, and tentative evidence is presented that it is rule based as opposed to analogic.

Both groups were equally assigned to 3 experimetal conditions "against" condition, "toward" condition, and control condition. All Ss read a story consisting of 2 parts: the 1st one described a wife satisfied with her marriage, while the 2nd showed her as becoming aware of her negative feelings towards her husband, and considering a possibility of leaving him. On the recognition test the normals showed more negative than positive false alarms in each condition. The same pattern emerged in schizophrenics only in "against" condition; in "toward" condition, they showed more positive alarms. It seems than when a possibility of individuation is blocked, schizophrenics show a tendency to distort the conflict-related information into positive direction.

Berlin (see record [rid]2002-17390-002[/rid]) regarding the ethics of underpowered clinical trials. First, much of their argument is based on "exposure of participants to the risks and burdens of human research." The commenting author disagrees with the premise that patients somehow make a sacrifice for the common good. Second, this argument is based on the language of false-positive and false-negative results. This ignores the Bayesian approach, which simply updates prior belief and narrows the credible limits on what the effects of treatment might be. Since decisions have to be made, even where there is no trial evidence, a little unbiased evidence is better than none. Third, Halpern et al allude to the risk of publication bias but this risk only materializes if small trials are not prospectively registered. Finally, although the authors point to the question of altruism, they do not discuss the evidence that most patients do not enter trials for altruistic reasons.

Abstract = {A cross-linguistic study of the development of answering systems to yes–no questions was conducted, with particular emphasis on the answering systems for negative questions (e.g., "Wasn't John at the party?"). In English, the answer depends on the underlying affirmative proposition of the question, using a positive/negative (P/N) system, whereas in Korean it depends on the surface form, using an agreement/disagreement (A/D) system. French uses the P/N system for true negative (TN) questions, but a contrapositive form for false negative (FN) questions. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of children between 1 yr 7 mo and 3 yrs 3 mo show that, across the 3 languages, children go through 3 similar developmental stages before they acquire the adult system. Language-specific phenomena include difficulty in using the A/D system for FN questions by Korean children and late acquisition of the contrapositive form by French children. Results suggest that universal cognitive development, pragmatic factors, and language-specific input interact in the development of the question-answering system.

Loftus' (see record [rid]2001-09234-001[/rid]) discussion of the development of false memories, especially as a creation of suggestive interventions, and their relevance to everyday life. The current author distinguishes between false positive memory and false negative memory, stating that there has been a wealth of research on the former concept and not the latter. It is suggested that efforts to research false negative memory should be undertaken, lest research psychology face the risk of being seen to suffer from bias towards aiding the wrongly accused and not the truly victimized.

Abstract = {Background: Influential studies have cast doubt on the validity of retrospective reports by adults of their own adverse experiences in childhood. Accordingly, many researchers view retrospective reports with scepticism. Method: A computer-based search, supplemented by hand searches, was used to identify studies reported between 1980 and 2001 in which there was a quantified assessment of the validity of retrospective recall of sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical/emotional neglect or family discord, using samples of at least 40. Validity was assessed by means of comparisons with contemporaneous, prospectively obtained, court or clinic or research records; by agreement between retrospective reports of two siblings; and by the examination of possible bias with respect to differences between retrospective and prospective reports in their correlates and consequences. Medium- to long-term reliability of retrospective recall was determined from studies in which the test-retest period extended over at least 6 months. Results: Retrospective reports in adulthood of major adverse experiences in childhood, even when these are of a kind that allow reasonable operationalisation, involve a substantial rate of false negatives, and substantial measurement error...

Abstract = {Purpose: To present a comparison of three measures for assessing elder abuse. Design and Methods: Three measures for assessing elder abuse were identified through a literature review. The characteristics and uses of each measure were reviewed and evaluated. Findings: The Indicators of Abuse (IOA) is a 22-item tool for discriminating abuse and nonabuse cases; it is completed by a health care professional after a home assessment is conducted. The Elder Abuse and Neglect Assessment (EAI) is a 44-item scale comprised of seven sections to review signs, symptoms, and subjective complaints of elder abuse, neglect, exploitation, and abandonment; it can be used by health care providers in all clinical settings. The Elder Abuse Screening Test (EAST) is a 15-item tool to be completed by a health care provider based on the patient's responses. This screening tool is limited because of the small unrepresentative samples used to test it, the low internal consistency, and a relatively high false-negative rate. Conclusions: An instrument to accurately assess elder abuse in long-term care is needed. Proper identification of elder abuse is the first step in assisting victims in dealing with abusive situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Some psychometric properties of the Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh (BITE; Henderson and Freeman, 1987) were analyzed in a non-clinical sample. The questionnaire was administered to 1122 adolescents, 669 girls and 453 boys from different schools, aged 12 to 21, from Málaga (Spain). The BITE consists of two subscales: the Symptom Scale and the Severity Scale. Both scales showed a unidimensional structure and a high internal consistency. From a ROC curve, cut-off points were established in the BITE scores related to DSM-IV bulimia diagnostic (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). With these cut-off points, a high specificity was found, but a lower sensitivity than that reported in clinical samples. However, scores in the bulimic group were higher than in any other eating disorder group or in those with no disorder. Thus, BITE shows a certain degree of validity in assessing specific symptoms of bulimia. As a diagnostic instrument, however, it may give a high rate of false negatives in samples from general populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Suicide is neither more nor less foreseeable in the few patients who attempt self-harm than in the many who make no such attempts. Finally, it is difficult to retrospectively distinguish the care provided patients attempting or committing suicide from that received by those who do not.

It is the thoroughness by which a therapist explores a patient's degree of risk and provides an appropriate remedy that determines his or her competence, not treatment outcome. That is, a therapist ought not be judged negligent because a patient ended his own life, but only because the patient was not carefully assessed or had failed to receive a proper course of treatment.

Abstract = {Because suicide is one of the few fatal consequences of psychiatric illness and is a source of extraordinary stress for loved ones and the clinician, accurate assessment of suicidal risk is an essential aspect of the mental health profession. Innumerable individual differences, along with the low base rate of suicide, make assessment a challenging task in clinical practice that is both delicate and time consuming. In this article, the authors recommend examining and incorporating each patient's personal characteristics, dispositional factors, situational factors, and current presentation of symptoms into a unique individual picture of suicidal risk. This portrait of potential for suicidal behavior can, in turn, be used to evaluate risk and design a course of action. This thorough yet concise approach will likely reduce omissions in assessment, and hopefully lead to fewer false negatives and fewer deaths of suicidal patients.

Abstract = {Many adolescents use home pregnancy tests when they suspect pregnancy. However, because of developmental issues and greater variation in menstrual cycles, teens are at risk for obtaining false-negative test results. Moreover, with teens, the need for a pregnancy test often accompanies the need for comprehensive reproductive care including evaluation for sexually transmitted infections and contraception. This article reviews the mechanisms of home pregnancy testing including sensitivity, accuracy, and home testing procedures. Clinical strategies for improving the accuracy of home pregnancy tests for teen users are discussed. Lastly, policy implications to improve teens' access to more accurate pregnancy testing and to reproductive health services are suggested.

The terms used to describe the performance of binary diagnostic tests are explained, using neuropsychiatric data on brain tissue in Alzheimer's disease. The 4 indices (true or false, positive or negative rates) of such tests can be described as conditional probabilities. The example provided shows that a diagnostic test's behavior depends not only on its intrinsic properties (i.e., sensitivity, specificity), but also on a property of the clinical situation where it is used (i.e., the prior probability of the disorder).

Abstract = {The fitness of a social insect colony depends greatly on the quality (i.e., mating ability, fecundity, and offspring viability) of its queen(s). In honeybees, there is marked variation in the quality of young queens that compete in a series of lethal duels to replace a colony's previous queen. Workers interact with queens during these duels and could increase their inclusive fitness by biasing the outcomes of the duels in favor of high-quality queens. We predicted that workers will have more antagonistic interactions (chasing, grabbing, clamping) and fewer beneficent interactions (feeding, grooming) with low-quality than high-quality queens. To test this prediction, we reared queens from 0-day-old, 2-day-old, and 3-day-old worker larvae in observation colonies undergoing queen replacement, thus producing high-quality, low-quality, and very low-quality queens, respectively. Immediately after each queen emerged, we observed her for 1 h to record her interactions with the workers. Subsequent morphological measurement of the queens confirmed that initial larval age had a significant effect on queen quality. However, there was no consistent effect of queen quality on the rates of worker-queen interactions, thus falsifying our hypothesis. The mean power of our tests was high (0.599), therefore the probability of a type II error (a false negative) is low. We conclude that if workers actively select high-quality queens, then they do so prior to queen duels, during queen development. We suggest that each worker-queen interaction has a distinct adaptive significance rather than forming a suite of behavior that favors particular queens (e.g., chasing repels any queen that approaches a queen cell, thus protecting all queen cells from destruction).

Abstract = {Aims: This study evaluates the suitability of gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis to follow-up the extent of benzodiazepine (mis)use in a Belgian prison population and compares it to other analytical strategies (e.g. screening followed by confirmation of the positive samples). Design and participants: From February to August 1998, 598 persons were jailed of which 188 (31.4% of the incoming detainees) volunteered to be screened. Urine samples (530 in total) were collected on the day of arrival and after 14, 30 and 90 days of imprisonment. Measurements: All samples were screened by EMIT® for benzodiazepines and analysed subsequently by GC-MS. Findings: EMIT® screening yielded 117 (22.1%) positive samples, a number which increased to 174 (32.8%) after GC-MS analysis. Of these 174 GC-MS positive samples, 119 (68.4%) contained one benzodiazepine while for the remaining samples multiple benzodiazepine (mis)use could be demonstrated. A significant increase in benzodiazepine (mis)use was indicated only from day 0 to day 14 based on the GC-MS results but not on the immunoassay results, even when the latter were complemented with GC-MS analysis of the positively screened samples. The GC-MS data also demonstrated that benzodiazepines are mainly (mis)used by subjects on benzodiazepine prescription as almost 50% of these subjects took additional non-prescribed benzodiazepines. During GC-MS analysis other drugs were co-extracted unintentionally and chromatographed and 23.9% of the volunteers were positive for illegal drugs on the day of arrival. Conclusion: Immunoassay results yield an underestimation of the problem of benzodiazepine (mis)use in prison due to the high false negative rate. GC-MS analysis of all samples therefore is the recommended strategy for this type of longitudinal study as it yields more correct and detailed information than the immunoassay results.

When individuals with both ADHD and reading disorders were excluded from the analysis, the authors found a significant difference between the ADHD group and the control group on the color-word test, indicating that poor reading skills may produce false negatives on the Stroop test. However, fast and slow readers with ADHD did not perform differently from each other on the color-word test.

Abstract = {Retrospective assessment of maternal smoking or substance use during pregnancy is sometimes unavoidable. The unusually close relationship of twin sister pairs permits comparison of self-report data versus co-twin informant data on substance use during pregnancy. Information about smoking during pregnancy has been gathered from a series of mothers from an Australian volunteer twin panel (576 women reporting on 995 pregnancies), supplemented in many cases by independent ratings of their smoking by twin sister informants (821 pregnancies). Estimates of the proportion of women who had never smoked regularly (56-58%), who had smoked but did not smoke during a particular pregnancy (16-21%), or who smoked throughout the pregnancy (16-18%), were in good agreement whether based on self-report or twin sister informant data. However, informants report underreported cases who smoked during the first trimester but then quit (1-3% versus 7-9% by self-report). Women who smoked throughout pregnancy (by informant report) rarely denied a history of regular smoking (< 1 %), although a small proportion of apparent false negative cases were identified where they either denied smoking during a pregnancy (9%) or denied smoking beyond the first trimester (10%). We conclude that retrospective smoking data can safely be used to identify potential associations of later child outcomes with maternal smoking during pregnancy.

While the family environment can directly influence later risk for psychopathology, dysfunction in the family of origin may also moderate the impact of genetic factors on liability for psychiatric disorders. Can a similar pattern be seen for the personality trait of Neuroticism (N) which is a risk factor for many psychiatric conditions? Method. Our sample of 957 complete female-female twin pairs from a population-based register had measures of self-reported N and multiple reporters (twin, co-twin, mother, father) for family dysfunction (FD). Statistical analysis was conducted by traditional regression analysis and a moderator structural equation twin model operationalized in the computer program Mx. Results. Dividing the sample into quartiles based on increasing levels of FD, the mean of N increased substantially while correlations of N in monozygotic (NIZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins were relatively constant. Regression analyses did not suggest greater twin resemblance for N with increasing levels of FD. The best-fit structural equation model was the standard un-moderated model in which the proportion of variance in N due to genetic (39%) and unique environmental effects (61%) remained constant across values of FD.

Abstract = {Two recent archival items offer material for analysis of Alfred Binet's (1857-1911) and Cyril Burt's (1883-1971) relationship in the early twentieth century. Burt's letter to Binet's biographer Theta Wolf was an answer to her request for information about his contact with Binet. An analysis of Burt's account prompts more questions than it answers. His statements in the letter are compared with previous ones and are put into the context of the activities of the two men, but these do not enlighten us about his actual relations with Binet. The problem arises because of Burt's desciptive vagueness and lack of supporting evidence. Despite attacks against Burt's integrity made from 1976 onward, we found no conclusive evidence of false claims. The negative outcome of this analysis probably results from Burt's faulty memory, and herein lies the caveat that personal memories make unreliable material for historical accounts.

Abstract = {Remarks that the article by S. Southwick et al (see record [rid]1997-02753-004[/rid]) on the consistency of memory for combat-related traumatic events among veterans of Operation Desert Storm raises several issues deserving of further consideration. Perhaps the most important of these is the determination of which memory report is more accurate. Given that it was not possible for Southwick et al to assess the accuracy of recall in their study, future research should identify traumatic situations for which accuracy can be verified and conduct multiple assessments of the recall of these traumatic events. In evaluating such recall, such research should distinguish "false negatives" from "false positives". Other issues worth pursuing is whether the report of the event changed over time and what aspect of memory is implicated in these changes.

Abstract = {Examined the validity of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and correlation between EAT-40 (D. M. Garner, et al, 1979) and EAT-26 (D. M. Garner, et al, 1982; abbreviated items of the EAT-40). Subjects (Ss) were 267 female patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and 235 female patients with bulimia nervosa (BN)(aged 15-36 yrs) in Kyoto University Hospital, and 80 normal healthy female adults (15-30 yrs) in Japan. Ss were administered the EAT-40 Japanese version (Y. Nakai, 1997) and EAT-26 Japanese version (H. Suematsu, et al, 1986) and both results were compared. The results showed that: (1) Ss' scores in the EAT-26 showed high correlation with those of the EAT-40; and (2) Ss with AN and BN had significantly higher scores in the EAT-26 compared with those of the healthy Ss; however, Ss with AN had higher false negatives than Ss with BN. These results suggest the validity of the EAT-40 and the EAT-26 and the necessity of developing a Japanese EAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recurrent brief depressive disorder (RBD) is a well-defined and significantly prevalent affective disorder with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and significant clinical impairment in the community and general practice. RBD is characterized by depressive episodes occurring at least once a month and lasting for only a few days. The lifetime co-occurrence of both RBD and major depressive disorder (MDD), called combined depression (CD), increases substantially the risk for suicide attempts, even more than is known for "pure" MDD. Diagnostic criteria for RBD can be found in the ICD-10 and DSM-IV and are helpful in both, research and clinical routine. Furthermore, several methodological issues are covered in this paper, which make clinical diagnostic and drug response evaluation of RBD very different from MDD. However, clinical procedures rather bear a resemblance to those used in the treatment of migraine or epilepsy. Formal differences in the course of RBD and MDD create different needs concerning the design of drug treatment studies. Absence of special methodological requirements and highly selected patient samples has probably been responsible for false negative results in double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment studies.

Abstract = {Often, the justice system demands a statement credibility assessment from the psychological expert witness, especially in cases where stronger evidence is lacking. This often happens in child sexual abuse offenses. A clinical assessment procedure called Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) has been developed to assess credibility in those cases. Despite being widely known in other places, CBCA has scarcely spread across the Iberoamerican countries. This review paper aims at contributing to the knowledge of that credibility-assessment technique in the Iberoamerican area. The origins of the CBCA are described, the reality criteria are listed and defined, the validity of the procedure is reviewed, and some shortcomings of the CBCA are mentioned. Our examination reveals that out of the 19 CBCA criteria only 8 have discriminated well in, at least, half the studies in which they have been tested. In addition, the CBCA overall accuracy is in general somewhat poor, and its false negative error rate is too high to use it confidently in real cases. Further research is needed to improve the technique thus creating a useful instrument. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Studied whether a human operator operator could correctly supervise a "low-cost" mobile robot with a minimal visual interface. An experiment was conducted simulating robot displacements, some of them with trajectory errors. Two kinds of information were available on the screen: the robot's position given by the odometer, and the ultrasonic sensor measures. Subjects were 34 18-26 yr old students, 9 of whom had a background in technology. As operators, their task was to detect robot trajectory errors when they occurred and to rate their level of confidence in their decisions. The classical Signal Detection Theory was applied to the results and an estimation of operators' self-confidence associated with types of decisions (hits, false alarms, correct negatives, misses) was calculated. The main results indicate that all operators could correctly detect trajectory errors. Operators with no technological background were more lax in their decisions than those with a technological background, but the latter were more overconfident in their omission decisions than the former. Results are discussed in terms of human machine cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants in this study were drawn from two sources: 803 men and women from the general adult population of Minnesota and 259 men and women who were admitted to a gambling treatment program. A 19-item measure of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling was administered, along with other validity measures. The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were found to be reliable and valid. With a standard cutoff score of 5, DSM-IV criteria yielded satisfactory classification accuracy results; however, a cutoff score of 4 made modest improvements in classification accuracy and, most important, reduced the rate of false negatives. The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling, when operationalized into questions, demonstrated satisfactory reliability, validity, and classification accuracy, and a cutoff score of 4 improved diagnostic precision.

Abstract = {Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder that holds the potential to afflict the emotional, familial, social, or scholastic performances of patients with Tourette syndrome in day-to-day life functioning. The disorder is today characterized mainly and diagnosed by clinical observations, yet false-negative results obtained in the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome are numerous and well documented. There is still no laboratory or imaging technique available for the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. This article reports on changes of the ambient thermal perception (38%) and a circadian dysregulation of the body-temperature profile present in Tourette syndrome probands, irrespective of their chronologic age, sex, or comorbid symptoms. An involvement of idiopathic hypothalamic dysfunctions associated with Tourette syndrome is proposed. Such a phenomenon, if substantiated, could lead to a better understanding of Tourette syndrome and the development of unbiased physical diagnostic criteria of Tourette syndrome and potentiate possible production of novel therapeutic possibilities.

Abstract = {Conducted a pilot study to provide normative data for the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) and the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) in a sample of 303 Spanish-speaking participants aged 14-17 yrs. Adolescents with and without social phobia completed the SPAI and the SAS-A. Initial results support both the Social Phobia subscale of the SPAI and the Total SAS-A score as indexes to minimize false negatives or positives. Nevertheless, the highest agreement was found when the SPAI and the SAS-A were used together. These findings suggest that these scales are not necessarily exclusive but complementary, as the use of both increased the efficiency of the diagnosis for social phobia. It is concluded that these results provide strong support for the SPAI Social Phobia subscale and the total SAS-A score together as the most appropriate measures for use in general screening.

Abstract = {In this study we undertook field-testing of a combination of two brief screening tools that identify women prisoners who may suffer major mental illness or present a risk of self-harm. Their ease of administration, tolerability, face validity and overall impact on the existing visiting psychiatric service were examined. The Referral Decision Scale and the Suicide Checklist were administered to 150 receptions at Arohata Women's Prison, New Zealand, over a 1-year period. Results indicate high levels of psychiatric morbidity similar to that found in previous studies and suggest more will be identified and receive intervention compared with the existing arrangements. Approximately one-third of the sample had been known to mental health services and a similar proportion had attempted suicide. The unique population ethnicity raises questions for the screening process and resource allocation. Previously proposed changes to the recommended cut-off scores are supported. High endorsement rates on the depressive sub-scale and self-reference stem require further investigation. This intervention appears to be well tolerated and quick to administer. Our experience suggests that the tool is sufficiently sensitive with an acceptable number of false negatives for a screening instrument. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Assessed 291 first graders (54.9% female and 45.1% male, mean age 79.7 mo) on reading, intelligence, and phonological processing at the beginning and end of the academic year to determine the accuracy of 3 different approaches to identification. The first procedure used the calibration data from a reference group's discriminant analysis, the second determined the children who scored below the mean on all of the reading and phonological variables (Simple Computation), and the last used a weighting system (Complex Computation). The children were classified into good and poor reading groups based on composite reading scores determined by averaging their standard scores on Word Identification, Word Attack, and Passage Comprehension of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test-Revised. The poor readers were further classified into groups containing children who had reading difficulties and children whose reading abilities were commensurate with their intelligence. Although all of the procedures provided relatively accurate identification, 80.2%, 87.3%, 89.7%, for the discriminant analysis, Simple Computation, and Complex Computation, respectively, the last procedure provided the best overall accuracy with the smallest percentage of false negatives (6.2%).

Abstract = {Presents a brief-access testing procedure for evaluating taste responses of individual mice to chemical stimuli that are considered palatable or unpalatable. The authors focused on three taste stimuli (quinine hydrochloride, QHCl; sodium chloride, NaCl; and sucrose) and one mouse strain (C57BU6). A screening procedure that can generate a concentration-response curve for NaCl or sucrose during a single 30 min test session, and for QHCl over three 30 min test sessions is described. A normative database based on the responses of 98 mice subjected to the screening procedure is also presented. It is envisioned that investigators could use this normative database to assess taste function in the progeny of mutagenized (or genetically altered) mice. Any mouse that deviates significantly from the mean of the normative database would be flagged as having a potentially interesting mutation. The authors also developed an additional second screen for identifying mice with oromotor abnormalities. This latter screen is necessary because oromotor problems could lead to false positives or negatives in the screen for taste function, but is also useful for researchers interested in genes influencing oromotor circuitry.

Abstract = {Notes that since the reliability of assessments is not perfect, empirical reliability estimates should be used instead of theoretically assumed perfect reliability. Implications of the reliability of psychiatric assessments for sample size and power calculations in clinical trials are presented. The theoretical basis of sample size and power calculations using empirical reliability scores is delineated. Examples from research on schizophrenia and depression are used to illustrate implications for study design and interpretation of results. The tremendous impact of the lack of reliability of psychopathologic assessments on sample size, power, and detectable true score differences in clinical trials is shown, and the problem of multiple outcome variables with different reliabilities is addressed. It is argued that studies lacking power because of unreliable assessments carry the risk of false-negative findings and raise ethical questions. Rater training is strongly recommended to assess and improve interrater reliability whenever necessary and possible before trials are started. It is concluded that sample size calculations and power analysis should be based on empirical reliability values of outcome parameters as part of quality assurance and cost savings.

Abstract = {Examined the relationship between personality traits, the 5-HT2A receptor function, and 5-HTZA receptor gene polymorphisms. 5-HT-induced intraplatelet calcium (Ca) mobilization, 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphisms (A-14386, T102C, T516C, C1340T, C1354T), and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) scores were examined in 133 healthy Ss (87 males, 46 females; mean age 33.2 yrs). Neither 5-HT-induced Ca mobilization nor 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphisms (A-14386, T102C) appear to be associated with 7 personality dimensions including Harm Avoidance. There was no significant difference in the Ca response among the Ss with--1438A/A, A/G and G/G genotypes. Since the appearance of the other types of the 5-HT2A receptor gene polymorphisms (T516C, C1340T and C1354T) was quite rare in the sample, the authors were unable to examine the relationship between these polymorphisms, and the TCI score or the Ca response. The failure to find a significant association may reflect the false negative results due to the small sample size and low statistical power. Further studies in depressed patients may clarify the complicated relationship between personality traits and the vulnerability of affective disorders.

Abstract = {Reports on the assessments and procedures carried out in relation to an adult female with learning difficulties whose competence as a witness in a criminal trial had been challenged. The S had been referred to the 1st author by the court for assessment in the course of a criminal trial. The assessment instruments used included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (WAIS--R), Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, and a set of structured questions devised for this particular S. The functions being measured were intelligence, social function, suggestibility and the ability to accurately and truthfully report factual information. The S's scores on the intelligence test brought her within the category of someone with learning difficulties, but she was found to have a high level of social functioning. She was highly suggestible, but she showed she could distinguish between false and truthful statements, despite negative feedback. The conclusion was that she would meet the requirements of a competent witness. As a consequence of the procedures used in this case, it was decided that the approach of using a combination of standard psychometric testing and a series of structured questions was the most appropriate method of assessing witness competence.

Abstract = {A validation study using 62 Ss was conducted on the Multidimensional Investigation of Neuropsychological Dissimulation (MIND), a neuropsychological instrument used to detect exaggeration of brain-injury symptoms. This instrument has 8 scoring indices that use multiple, empirically based strategies to detect poor effort. Discriminant function analysis was used to classify 3 groups of Ss: 24 normals responding in a sincere manner; 21 normals who were educated about mild to moderate head injuries and given substantial incentives to malinger without obvious detection; and 17 clinically diagnosed, brain-injured patients with mild to moderate impairments. A univariate F test indicates significant group differences on 6 of the 8 original predictor variables. Using these 6 variables, there was an overall classification rate of 68%, reflecting only a 10% false negative rate in the dissimulating group. For a 2-group classification (i.e., dissimulating and mildly to moderately brain-injured Ss), an 82% overall accuracy rate was achieved. The authors conclude that the MIND appears to have potential for identifying individuals exaggerating mild to moderate neuropsychological deficits.

Abstract = {This article investigates in two studies the commitment decision by medical and legal experts to assess the dangerousness of mentally ill persons with the objective of making a decision on civil commitment. In study 1, 7 judges and 12 psychiatrists participated and in study 2, 32 cases from 5 psychiatric emergency units were studied. It is hypothesized that an 'expertise bias' may explain differences between the medical and the legal expert in defining the dangerousness concept (study 1), and in assessing the seriousness of the danger (study 2). Judges define dangerousness more often as harming others, whereas psychiatrists more often include harm to self in the definition. In assessing the seriousness of the danger, experts tend to be more tolerant with regard to false negatives, as the type of behavior is more familiar to them. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by V. Fish (Child Maltreatment: Journal of the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, 1998[Aug], Vol 3[3], 204–223). A table accompanying the article was inaccurate. A corrected table is presented. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]1998-10081-001[/rid].) Epidemiological concerns about base rates, true and false positives, and the possibility of an epidemic of therapy-induced false memories are frequently raised in the debate over delayed memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Most references to epidemiological concepts emphasize the potential problem of false positives arising from therapists' assessments of CSA but neglect the potential problem of false negatives. A more balanced epidemiological analysis that includes estimations of the risks of both false positives and false negatives is more relevant to clinical concerns and better identifies gaps in our understanding of this areas. This article presents estimates for certain epidemiological variables based on available research and a range of suppositions. The evidence at hand suggests that the rate of false negatives for CSA history poses a larger epidemiological problem than the rate of false positives.… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Behavioral tests have become important tools for the analysis of functional effects of induced mutations in transgenic mice. However, depending on the type of mutation and several experimental parameters, false positive or negative findings may be obtained. Given the fact that molecular neurobiologists now make increasing use of behavioral paradigms in their research, it is imperative to revisit such problems. In this review 3 tests (T-maze spontaneous alternation task [T-CAT], Context dependent fear conditioning [CDFC], and Morris water maze [MWM] sensitive to hippocampal function), serve as examples for the potential problems. CDFC can provide misleading results because the context test, assumed to be a configural task dependent on the hippocampus, may have a significant elemental, i.e. cued, component. MWM may pose problems if its visible platform task is disproportionately easier for the subjects to solve than the hidden platform task, if the order of administration of visible and hidden platform tasks is not counterbalanced, or if inappropriate parameters are measured.

Abstract = {Examined the utility of teacher ratings of children's behaviour, oral language, and literacy skills in identifying children with educational problems, and examined the relationship between behaviour, oral language, and literacy skills. Teacher ratings were obtained for a cohort of 129 Year 2 pupils from 5 schools in Western Australia, using three brief screening questionnaires. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the screening instruments in identifying children with educational problems as determined by psychometric criteria, direct psychometric assessment of oral language, vocabulary, reading, and spelling was conducted for a subset of the children. Teacher ratings of language, literacy, and behaviour correlated significantly with the standardised test scores. The screening instruments for language and literacy had reasonable sensitivity (74%) and specificity (92%), but a fairly high rate of false negatives (26%) and relatively poor positive predictive power (.53) for identifying children with problems in language and/or literacy. The prevalence of marked behaviour problems in this Australian sample of school children (9.6%) was comparable to that found in previous studies.

Abstract = {Explores definitions and predictors of employee substance abuse, using 173 employed undergraduates (aged 18-52 yrs) who completed a prominent written integrity test and a self-report of work behaviors, including on-the-job (OTJ) alcohol and drug abuse. Approximately 21% of participants reported recent OTJ abuse and were significantly more likely than nonabusers to exhibit other counterproductive work behaviors. Validity coefficients for the integrity test's Employability Index and Drug Avoidance Scale suggest that such measures can reduce OTJ abuse, but the procedure's effectiveness may be limited by the high rate of false negatives. The authors discuss suggestions for improving psychological testing to reduce OTJ abuse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the relationship between psychosis and aggression, apathy, and functional status in 61 outpatients with dementia (mean age 74.4 yrs). The presence of psychosis was assessed by clinical interview and 2 scales: the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (CUSPAD). The maximum likelihood estimation technique was used to determine the best estimate of the presence of psychosis. Aggression, apathy, and functional status (activities of daily living: ADLs) were measured using structured instruments. Results indicate that the CUSPAD and NPI provided low false positive and negative rates. analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses showed that psychosis was significantly associated with aggression, even when controlling for apathy, depression, and ADLs. Psychosis was related to apathy only when depression was controlled for. Hallucinations were related to impaired basic ADLs, even when depression and apathy were controlled for.

Abstract = {The Canadian Study of Health and Aging produced an estimate of the incidence of dementia among elderly Canadians by following up, after 5 yrs, the undemented found in an initial prevalence survey. Initial and follow-up estimates could be biased by false-negative error in the screening tool used for Ss living in the community, and by erroneous classification of Ss who died in the interim. Here, the authors use a deterministic mathematical model to quantify those possible biases. They conclude that, using the estimates of the errors from control samples, the incidence among community Ss would be overestimated by 15%, and the incidence among the institutional Ss would be underestimated by 37%. The overall incidence would be underestimated by 14%. Most of the bias can be attributed to inaccuracies in the classification of deaths.

Abstract = {The authors discuss criticisms of work by R. K. Heaton et al (1991) describing Comprehensive Norms for use with the expanded Halstead Reitan Battery (HRB), specifically in the evaluation of patients of advanced age and/or limited education. Two clinical cases are presented to illustrate the potential risk of obtaining false negative results when relying solely on this non-native system to assess cognitive functioning in such a population. In both cases, the patients were older men with very little education, presenting with memory complaints and mild cerebral atrophy. When norms described by Heaton et al were used to interpret their HRB test scores, both patients were classified as unimpaired. However, when R. M. Reitan and D. Wolfson's (1993) norms were used, both patients were diagnosed as mildly–moderately impaired. This diagnosis was consistent with supplementary test results, imaging results, and complaints in both cases. The cases highlight the possibility of misclassifying elderly and/or less educated individual patients as neurologically normal when utilizing the Comprehensive normative system. The clinical and forensic implications of such errors are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Theories of agrammatism have been challenged by the discovery that agrammatic patients can make above-chance judgements of grammaticality. Chinese poses an interesting test of this phenomenon, because its grammar is so austere, with few obligatory features. An on-line grammaticality judgement task was conducted with 37 normal university students and 11 aphasic speakers of Chinese (aged 16–76 yrs), using the small set of constructions that do permit judgements of grammaticality in this language. Broca's and Wernicke's aphasics showed similar patterns, with above-chance discrimination between grammatical and ungrammatical forms, suggesting once again that Broca's aphasics are not unique in the degree of sparing or impairment that they show in receptive grammar. However, even for young normal Ss, false-negative rates were high. The authors conclude that there is some sensitivity to grammatical well-formedness in Chinese aphasics, but the effect is fragile for aphasics and probabilistic for normal Ss, reflecting the peculiar status of grammaticality in this language.

Abstract = {Explores the sensitivity and specificity of a brief screener used to identify persons living with HIV who engage in unprotected sexual intercourse and/or injection drug use. 178 HIV positive clients (aged 22–66 yrs) of a large AIDS service organization in Los Angeles were screened with a brief, 7-item questionnaire, and responses on the screening interview were compared with self-reports obtained in an in-depth computerized assessment administered on the same day. Participants were randomized to receive the in-depth computerized assessment administered by an interviewer, or a self-administered audio-computer assisted interview. Screener sensitivity and specificity rates were relatively low (68% and 78%, respectively), and sensitivity was lower among African Americans than non-African Americans. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that false negative screener responses were associated with recent sexually transmitted disease experience, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and interview administration mode. It is concluded that effective strategies need to be developed that screen persons living with HIV who may be transmitting HIV to their sexual or drug-injecting partners.

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to use longitudinal report data on physical and sexual abuse to examine the stability and consistency of abuse reports. The study was based on the birth cohort of 1,265 young people studied in the Christchurch Health and Development Study. At ages 18 and 21 yrs, these young people were questioned about their childhood exposure to physical punishment and sexual abuse. Concurrent with these assessments, sample members were also assessed on measures of psychiatric disorder and suicidal behavior. Reports of childhood sexual abuse and physical punishment were relatively unstable and the values of kappa for test-retests of abuse reporting were in the region of .45. Inconsistencies in reporting were unrelated to the S's psychiatric state. Latent class analyses suggested that (1) those not abused did not falsely report being abused; and (2) those who were abused provided unreliable reports in which the probability of a false negative response was in the region of 50%. Different approaches to classifying Ss as abused led to wide variations in the estimated prevalence of abuse but estimates of the relative risk of psychiatric adjustment problems conditional on abuse exposure remained relatively stable.

The MDA is a visual aid (decision board) comprising graphics and written material describing clinical alternatives, outcomes, and probabilities. The MDA is assembled interactively and includes information about logistics (cost, time, discomfort) and risks (sequelae of false positive or negative results), probability of developing breast cancer, and benefits of mammography regarding breast cancer outcomes. Reliability was assessed as the stability of the decision with the same information after 1–2 weeks. Validity (comprehension of information) was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively (focus groups, standardized probes for comprehension). Ss were a convenience sample of 49 50–81 yr old European-American and 54 49–89 yr old Mexican-American women. Results show that reliability was 100%. In validity testing, 89% changed preferences as predicted with changed probabilities. Comprehension was confirmed qualitatively with Spanish and English versions.

Abstract = {Kindergarten screening is a common practice in the United States. Educators and mental health professionals are interested in finding methods that will lead to effective interventions for children and families. This study examined three kindergarten screening methods. The Parenting Stress Index, the Behavior Assessment System for Children, and an informal letter/number probe were compared in predicting first grade reading and math. Correlational analyses showed that each method was significantly related to first grade reading and math, as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery - Revised. Multiple regression analyses revealed that letter and number recognition in kindergarten were the best predictors of first grade reading and math. Child behavior and parenting stress were also significantly related to reading and math, although the additional variance explained was relatively small. Discriminant analyses revealed that the measures were good at identifying those children who were not "at-risk" but the overall prediction of adequate versus poor readers was less than chance. All of the methods produced large percentages of false positives and negatives. Implications for screening efforts are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Nonverbal emotional decoding and encoding abilities of 58 undergraduates were examined as a function of their self-reported history of interparental violence. The 5 emotions of happiness, surprise, anger, fear, and sadness were used in both nonverbal tasks. A modified version of a posed nonverbal encoding procedure used by H. S. Friedman et al (1980) was used. Ss were videotaped while repeating each of 2 sentences with ambiguous verbal content as if to portray 5 different emotions. The nonverbal decoding measure was a videotape created for use in this study. Ss viewed the videotape, showing people portraying different emotions, and guessed which emotion was being portrayed. Ss exposed to domestic violence showed decoding and encoding deficits. Results for decoding showed an emotion-specific deficit for recognizing happiness, but no evidence for an advantage in decoding anger and fear. In contrast, Ss from violent homes showed overall deficits in posed encoding of emotions. There was no evidence for an emotion-specific encoding bias in the pattern of false negatives and no evidence for suppression of general expressiveness. The authors conclude that the encoding deficit of students from violent homes is a result of inappropriate encoding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Compares data on depression in 349 Ss in the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area follow-up obtained by interviewers using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) and by psychiatrists using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) at the level of diagnosis, syndrome, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) symptom groups. Agreement on diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) was only fair (κ = 0.20). The DIS missed many cases meeting SCAN criteria for diagnosis due to Ss with false-negative diagnoses who did not report symptoms attributed to life crises or medical conditions. Logistic regression analysis indicated that underdetection by the DIS was associated with older age, male sex, and lower impairment. There was substantial correlation between the DIS and SCAN in numbers of symptom groups. Agreement was highest when both the SCAN and DIS thresholds were set at depression syndrome instead of diagnosis. Failure to find high diagnostic agreement between the SCAN (for clinical use) and the DIS (for epidemiologic use) has implications for the credibility of prevalence estimates. A bias toward underreporting and stronger agreement at the syndrome and symptom levels of depression suggests that associations with risk factors are conservative.

Abstract = {Examined college men's differential ability to suppress sexual arousal as a function of (a) stimulus media (audio-only vs. audiovisual), (b) experience with the procedure, and (c) novelty of the stimulus material. Ss were 35 men aged 19–40 yrs old. Further, galvanic skin response (GSR) and finger pulse amplitude (FPA) were examined as possible methods of detecting attempts to suppress sexual arousal. In general, participants were able to reduce substantially their plethysmographically-assessed erectile response, and these efforts were not significantly detectable through GSR or FPA measurement. Further, neither experience nor stimulus novelty were found to have a significant effect on arousal or the ability to suppress it. Participants were, however, less aroused in response to audio-only presentations than audiovisual presentations once they were experienced with the procedure. This effect, in combination with participants' considerable ability to suppress, could result in more false negative conclusions being drawn when audio-only, versus audiovisual stimulation, is used in sex-offender plethysmography.

Abstract = {In the past few years, there have been many simulation studies on the efficacy of symptom validation tests. These typically involved nonclinical participants. This line of research was limited because the impact of the experience of head injury was not examined. Researchers failed to understand whether individuals with head injury would feign cognitive deficits on symptom validation tests as well as their nonclinical counterparts did. This study was designed to investigate simulation of memory deficits among the head injured on the Portland Digit Recognition Test (PDRT; L. Binder, 1993). Head injury patients (aged 23–76 yrs), 24 with and 22 without corroborated brain damage, and a group of controls were involved to resemble clinical populations. Results showed that false negative rates ranged from 67%–84% when participants were asked to feign memory difficulty on the PDRT. Head injury patients, regardless of corroboration of brain damage, were equally capable of feigning memory deficits on the PDRT as their nonclinical counterparts. Findings suggest that the additive value of symptom validity tests, such as the PDRT, can be limited for their use as malingering tests. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Homocystinuria can result in ectopia lentis, mental retardation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disturbances. This study reviews the results of neonatal screening for homocystinuria over a period of 32 yrs in New England. Additional specimens were requested for repeated analysis when blood methionine measurements were at or above the established cutoff level. Homocystinuria due to cystathionine,6-synthase deficiency was confirmed by quantitative amino acid analyses. For the 1st 23.5 yrs of the review period, the blood methionine cutoff value was 2 mg per deciliter. Among the 2.2 million infants screened during that period, 8 with homocystinuria were identified in 1990, the cutoff value was reduced to 1 mg per deciliter. Among the 1.1 million infants screened in the subsequent 8.5 yrs, 7 with the disorder were identified. During the latter period, the specimens were collected from 6 of the 7 infants when they were 2 days of age or less, 5 of the 6 had blood methionine concentrations below 2 mg per deciliter. A cutoff level for blood methionine of 1 mg per deciliter in neonatal screening tests for homocystinuria should identify affected infants who have only slightly elevated concentrations of methionine and reduce the frequency of false negative results.

Abstract = {Police officers frequently use the presence or absence of an alcohol breath odor for decisions on proceeding further into sobriety testing. Epidemiological studies report many false negative errors. The current study used 20 experienced officers as observers to detect an alcohol odor from 14 Ss (aged 21–35 yrs) who were at blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) ranging from 0–0.130 g/dl. Over a 4 hr period, each officer had 24 opportunities to place his nose at the terminal end of a 6 inch tube through which the Ss blew. Ss were hidden behind screens with a slit for the tube to prevent any non-odor cues. Under these optimum conditions, odor was detected only two-thirds of the time for BACs below 0.08, and 85% of the time for BACs at or above 0.08%. After food consumption, correct detections declined further. Officers were unable to recognize whether the alcohol beverage was beer, wine, bourbon or vodka. Odor strength estimates were unrelated to BAC levels. Estimates of BAC level failed to rise above random guesses. These results demonstrate that even under optimum laboratory conditions, breath odor detection is unreliable, which may account for the low detection rate found in roadside realistic conditions.

Abstract = {In common with other animal models of psychopathology, the forced-swimming test (FST) suffers from the fact that it involves normal animals. Moreover, powerful antidepressant drugs such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been found to give false negatives in this behavioral test. To circumvent these theoretical and practical difficulties, we studied the interindividual variability of the behavioral reactivity of rats in the FST. The effects of fluoxetine treatment or of a stressful experience (repeated testing in the FST) were analyzed on various behavioral responses. The following observations were made in replicated experiments: 1) a dimensional behavioral response from passivity to high reactivity in the FST; 2) an antidepressant-like effect of fluoxetine only in a subgroup of animals categorized as low responders on the dimension of passivity-reactivity; and 3) a switch toward passive responses following a past experience of stress, which was corrected by fluoxetine treatment. It is concluded that a dimensional approach could improve the screening of antidepressant drugs and could aid the development of new ones by identifying the biobehavioral characteristics of responder and nonresponder Ss.

Abstract = {Empirically tested P. S. Fastenau and K. M. Adams' (1996) concerns about using regression-based norms (RBN) to statistically correct for demographic influences. A widely used RBN system (R. K. Heaton et al, 1991) was applied to scores from 63 healthy older adults (aged 60–80 yrs) for the Trail Making Test, Boston Naming Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Age influences on all tests were virtually eliminated by the RBNs, whereas education influences were created by the RBN (better educated older adults penalized by the norms). Using RBNs from the Revised WCST Manual also created distortions, far overcorrecting for age. Findings cast considerable suspicion on norms that are generated by statistical regression when there are not adequate numbers of people supporting each demographic cell. Clinically, these norms can lead to higher rates of false negatives (or missed diagnoses) in older adults, especially those with less education and especially women in their 60s.

Abstract = {34 clients just entering treatment for nonalcohol primary drug use were asked to report on their frequency of drug use at 2 times 2 days apart using the Form 90D interview. Test–retest correlations for the lifetime use of drugs were fair to excellent, and those for drug use in the last 90 days, although variable, were generally very good. For lifetime use, correlations were highest for opiates and stimulants and lowest for inhalants, whereas for the recent period correlations were highest for opiates and lowest for stimulants. Correlations were uniformly high for measures of general life functioning. Initial validity assessments with urine drug screen results as criterion were good, with no false negative errors in 4 of 6 drug use categories. Overall Form 90D appears to be a reasonably reliable and valid interview instrument for measuring drug use occurrence and frequency for both lifetime and recent use.

Abstract = {Investigated how hippocampal ibotenic acid lesion affects conditioned fear. Experiments with 16 4-mo-old male mice confirm that extensive lesions localized to the hippocampus impair context-dependent learning but also show that, unlike in previous rat studies, the behavioral impairment is only partial. Furthermore, studying 2 inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) with highly different hippocampal function, it is shown that the presence or absence of a conditioned stimulus during training may influence the mouse's ability to learn complex multiple contextual stimuli in a genotype-dependent manner. It is concluded that performance at the "context" test may be based on complex configural (hippocampal) learning but it can also be based on a more simple elemental (non-hippocampal) learning thus leading to potentially false-negative findings in the analysis of hippocampal dysfunction.

Abstract = {Determined normative values for the visual sensitivity thresholds in 118 5–8 yr olds using automated static perimetry. 17 adults also participated. The children first underwent a familiarization procedure. One week later, quantitative examination was performed according to a specially designed schedule divided into 3 phases. For each of the 76 points tested, mean thresholds and standard deviations were calculated as a function of age. Results show that sensitivity difference between adults and children over the central 30° of the visual field emerged only for the youngest age groups (5- and 6-yr-olds). Both the response rate in false-negative trials, and values of a within-subject threshold variability index, suggested that 5- and 6-yr-olds' higher thresholds were inflated by non physiological factors, such as vigilance and cognitive processes. For these ages, the data reported here should be considered as an approximation of the upper level of the thresholds. In contrast, the results for 7- and 8-yr-olds provided reliable normative values for light sensitivity across the visual field.

The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the PTSD module for the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Nonpatient Version, PTSD module (SCID-NP-PTSD) were administered in a telephone interview. SCID-NP-PTSD results indicated prevalence rates of 6% and 4% for current and lifetime PTSD, respectively. Use of the recommended cutoff score of 50 on the PCL-C to determine diagnosis of current cancer-related PTSD resulted in a sensitivity of .60 and a specificity of .99 with 2 false-negative diagnoses. In conclusion, PTSD can be precipitated by diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, and the PCL-C can be a cost-effective screening tool for this disorder.

Abstract = {Dr. McCusker's coin-flipping analogy can be seriously misleading. Given its high true-negative rate, the COVR's overall accuracy makes it vastly better than a coin flip. Only after patients were classified by the software as high risk did they have a roughly 50 percent probability of being violent. The utility of the COVR seems most reasonably evaluated against alternative approaches to risk assessment rather than against absolutist expectations. In this regard, the findings reported in the COVR validation study represent a level of accuracy equal to the highest true-positive rate reported for unstructured clinical prediction, with a much lower false-negative rate. The clinical predictions reported by Lidz and colleagues were achieved after detailed patient interviews by nurses, residents, and attending psychiatrists. In contrast, it takes seven minutes, on average, to administer the COVR. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Detailed data were collected on lifetime caffeine intake from 202 Vermont residents using a random-digit dial telephone survey. The sample appeared representative and test–retest reliability of caffeine intake was high (r = .95). Almost all participants (96%) had ever used and most (83%) presently used one or more caffeinated beverages weekly. The average caffeine intake was 186 mg/day. Many caffeine users (61%) used caffeinated beverages other than coffee. Current caffeine intake was a poor measure of lifetime intake. For example, among ever-users of caffeine, 41% had stopped at least 1 type of caffeinated beverage and 14% had stopped caffeine altogether. Cessation was mostly due to health concerns and unpleasant side effects. It was concluded that simply asking about "usual" coffee use is a poor and biased estimate of lifetime caffeine use. Thus, prior findings that caffeine is not associated with medical or behavioral disorders may represent false-negative results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract = {Sixty-five patients (aged 22–75 yrs) with brain damage were examined with 5 accepted methods of diagnosing dementia (Syndromkurztest, KAI-MWT-Methode, Demenz-Test, Mini-Mental-Status-Test, Wurzer-Methode) and a comprehensive performance test battery as an external criterion to determine the validity of the tests in determining the degree of dementia and differentiating accidental and pathological changes in cognitive ability. The methods differed significantly in their ability to determine the severity of dementia. The methods accurately differentiated accidental performance changes in comparison with the external criterion of validity, but did not accurately differentiate pathological changes in cognitive ability.

Abstract = {The accuracy of the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) in detecting the presence of cognitive impairment among substance-abusing patients was examined. The NCSE and the Neuropsychological Screening Battery (NSB), which has been shown in previous studies to discriminate reliably between cognitively impaired and intact substance abusing patients, were administered to 51 detoxified patients. Using participants' performances on the NSB as the criterion measure, 22 (43%) were found to be cognitively impaired. The NCSE identified only 8 of these 22 patients (36%) as being impaired; additionally, 4 of the 29 patients found to be cognitively intact by the NSB (14%) were classified as impaired by the NCSE. Thus, the false-negative rate of the NCSE is too high to recommend its use with substance-abusing patients (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

Abstract = {Studied the diagnostic reliability of the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register in terms of the psychiatric morbidity experienced by a national birth cohort, as a prerequisite to the use of the register in psychiatric epidemiological research. The authors investigated all entries to the register for a sample based upon the Northern Finland 1966 birth cohort at the age of 16 yrs. Until the end of 1993, a total of 563 Ss (aged 27 yrs) had a register diagnosis indicating a psychiatric illness. 37 of these Ss were diagnosed with schizophrenia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) operational criteria were applied to clinical information in the available original hospital records for 249 cases of psychosis, personality disorder, and substance abuse. Of these cases, 71 fulfilled criteria for schizophrenia, including all of the 37 cases in the register and an additional 34 (48% false-negatives) most frequently diagnosed in the register as schizophreniform or other psychosis. Despite the official use of DSM-III-R nomenclature, it appears that the clinical concept of schizophrenia in Finland, manifest within the register, remains very restrictive. The application of operational criteria is a necessary prerequisite for schizophrenia research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The central thesis of this critical analysis is that racial-self pervade the social structure and political economy and thereby affect consciousness, identity and all forms of relationships including the clinical context. Given this empirically grounded axiom, it is imperative that social workers become cognizant of the dynamic influence of race in practice and in research. Social class and gender are also potent variables in the equation. However, race—especially the "Black–White" dichotomization—is the principal molder of multiple forms of interaction. Within the clinical milieu, it can result in biased and negative imagery, false comparisons, erroneous prejudgments, deceptive language, and the nullification of the "other's" identity. Caution must be exercised by clinicians who attempt to structure the racial self primarily as a sexualized entity. Social workers, psychotherapists and other clinicians must understand the far-reaching impact of their self-attitudes, images, personal biases and needs on the therapeutic process.

Specific issues addressed are: (1) the problem of nondifferentiated brain-damage samples both in terms of type and severity of neuropathology, and (2) psychometric issues, particularly in terms of the possibility of a Type II error (false negative results). An argument is presented which suggests that the relative absence of positive findings of a high probability in the Reitan and Wolfson research is inconsistent with current theoretical and research indications of a high probability for compromised neuropsychological function in brain-damaged populations due to older age and lower education effects.

Abstract = {Examined the family history method's validity for identifying schizophrenia related disorders (SRDs) by comparing family history and family study derived diagnoses. 284 1st degree relatives of 48 psychiatrically disordered probands (aged 21–73 yrs), predominantly with schizophrenia, were diagnosed using the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria (FH-RDC). Supplementary criteria for schizophrenia related personality disorders (SRPs) were also assessed. 196 of these relatives were independently diagnosed by RDC and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R) on both axis I and axis II in a family study. Sensitivity for psychotic-SRDs was improved by inclusion of SRPs which captured 3 of the 5 false negative relatives. The sensitivity of SRPs for schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder was 0.39 (15/38) and the specificity was 0.92 (127/138). The FH-RDC have moderately good sensitivity and excellent specificity for the psychotic schizophrenia related disorders. While family history criteria for SRPs are not a good proxy for schizotypal or paranoid PD, they can enhance the family history method's sensitivity for SRDs.

Abstract = {This review discusses a special set of problems and opportunities for study design and analysis presented by multiparous species. Evidence is presented that litter effects are pervasive and persist into adulthood. Unaccounted for, they lead to spurious findings, inflate real effect sizes, and produce false negatives. Furthermore, two-stage sampling, the practice of sampling only a subset of littermates from dams, can lower reliability, and therefore power, to unacceptable levels. In addition, the greater sensitivity offered by within-litter analyses over between-litter analyses is demonstrated. Statistical and experimental solutions are suggested and referenced.

Nineteen emotionally disturbed boys (mean age 10.2 yrs) with feminine gender identity were compared on these indicators with 21 control boys. All Ss had been given a battery of psychological tests, including the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Draw-a-Person (DAP), and Rorschach. The indicators which were found to be valid were drawing the female figure with a greater value than the male figure in the DAP; difficulty in identification with the male figure in stories to the DAP; a low relative rate of male human responses and/or a high relative rate of female human responses in the Rorschach; and initial butterfly response to Card V in the Rorschach. Using these indicators in combination reduced the false positive and negative rates associated with each individual indicator. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes the properties that allow the identification of innuendo and stresses that this identification is concerned with the pragmatics of utterance interpretation rather than the cognitive mechanisms of information processing. Innuendoes most often arise at critical junctures of interaction which require speakers to act in order to influence others yet to conceal their intentions in order to avoid the risks that would be involved in their overt expression. Innuendoes may be venomous or non-venomous depending on their aim. The author defines venomous innuendo as a non-overt intentional negative ascription, whether true or false, usually in the form of an implicature, which is understood as a charge against what is, for the most part, a non-present party. The use of innuendo as a means of attacking a target is the result of a calculation of the risks of explication together with the benefits of implication. Non-venomous innuendo, especially in the form of sexual innuendo, is also examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The model suggested that errors of measurement in reports of child smoking largely arose from false negative responses in which children who had smoked described themselves as not smoking; false negative rates were in the region of 40%. The consequences of the high false negative rates are shown to lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of smoking experimentation and of the strength of association between maternal and child smoking.

Abstract = {Examined the accuracy of eyewitness accounts provided by police cadets and civilians in South Korea. 50 male cadets from a police college, and 100 male and 104 female civilian college students watched a videotaped enactment of a robbery. The next day, Ss were asked to identify the perpetrator from photographs of the perpetrator taken from different angles and wearing different outfits together with 40 photographs of other individuals. Analyses within the framework of signal detection theory suggest that the major difference between police Ss and civilian Ss was in their perceptual sensitivity rather than in their judgmental criteria, with the police cadets being inferior to the civilians in perceptual sensitivity. However, a strong positive correlation was found between the observed sensitivity index and the observed criterion index. Results suggest that (1) visually monotonous social environments may decrease perceptual sensitivity in the identification of people, (2) police cadets are no better at avoiding false negative errors than are civilian college students, and (3) perceptual sensitivity in the identification of people is strongly related to judgmental criteria, presumably because personal emphasis is on individuality.

Risk status was based on a 33-item checklist known as the Critical Events Index (Walker & Severson, 1990), a measure of behavioral pinpoints having high salience and intensity, but relatively low frequency. Multivariate and univariate analyses show that the 3 at-risk groups differ primarily on social competence and externalizing behavior measures. Cross-validated stepwise discriminant function analyses contrasting the HR and LR Ss using combinations of social competence, externalizing, internalizing, and school history variables correctly identified over 85% of the HR Ss and over 78% of the LR Ss. Discriminant function analysis based solely on externalizing behaviors create an unacceptable false negative rate for risk status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated behavior patterns in the rat forced swimming test (FST) produced by antidepressants that selectively inhibit norepinephrine (NE) or serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) uptake. A behavior sampling technique was used to score swimming, climbing, diving, and immobility. Five monoamine uptake blocking antidepressants and 2 5-HT1A receptor agonists decreased immobility in the FST and produced distinct patterns of active behaviors. The selective NE uptake inhibitors desipramine and maprotiline increased climbing, while the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, and the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and gepirone increased swimming. Results show that SSRIs are not false negatives; at least 2 behaviorally distinct processes occur in the FST; and enhancement of NE neurotransmission may mediate climbing, while enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission may mediate swimming.

Abstract = {Studied intra- and cross-modal matching of nonsense forms in a 2 * 2 * 3 factorial experiment with 48 undergraduates. Standard modalities (visual vs tactual), comparison modalities (visual vs tactual), and intervals between standard and comparison (1, 10, and 30 sec) were varied. The errors were divided into false negatives and false positives. Significant effects of standard modality and of comparison modality were found for false negatives. For false positives the most prominent effect was an interaction between the standard modality and the comparison modality. Retention interval had no effect in any of the modality conditions. Effects are discussed in terms of differential information processing capacity for the visual and the tactual modalities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Covers the psychological problem of negation. Negatives do not usually cause difficulty in daily life, but in laboratory tasks the Ss tend to adopt computer-like operations in order to avoid considering them directly. This apparent paradox may be resolved by an interpretation of the fact that, in verification tasks, true affirmatives are easier than false affirmatives, but false negatives easier than true negatives. Formal models of negation explain the coding processes responsible for this interaction, but ignore the fact that the "false negative," rather than the "true negative," approximates to linguistic usage. The "false negative" is analogous to the negative which corrects a preconception rather than one which maintains a truth. It is suggested that the serial operations, which the Ss adopt in verification tasks, are an attempt to recover the preconception which is not explicit.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments with undergraduates (N = 22) to examine the effects of negation on how people make use of information in the presuppositions and implications of sentences. Ss were timed as they made true-false judgments of sentences, e.g., "If John forgot to let the dog out, then the dog is supposed to be in." The verbs were either positive (e.g., "remember") or inherently negative (e.g., "forget"); the conclusions interrogated either presuppositions (e.g., "the dog is supposed to be out") or implications (e.g., "the dog is out"). Ss found it easier to verify positive components as true and negative components as false. This happened regardless of the polarity (positive or negative) of the parent sentence. Ss took longer on negative verbs, but spent an equal amount of time on presuppositions and implications, even though such negation does not logically affect presuppositions. This suggests that people may examine implications before presuppositions regardless of which component is interrogated. (15 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {According to the serial model, when S decides whether a sentence accurately describes a feature of a picture, he performs 2 independent, serial operations, of which contributions to total processing time are additive. The S checks (a) whether the sentence representation matches the picture representation on the feature, and (b) whether a negative is present in the sentence. In 4 experiments with 20 undergraduates each, Ss compared sentence (e.g., "is north, isn't north, is east") with the location of a circle. Contrary to the serial model (a) mean RT for true-negative sentences was shorter than was predicted based on RT for false affirmatives and false negatives; and (b) RT was longer if the features of the sentence and circle matched on axis (horizontal, vertical) and differed as to specific direction than if they differed on both axis and specific direction, and this axis-match effect was larger if the sentence was negative. Results support a model in which feature matching and negation coding are parallel operations sharing a limited-capacity central processor.

Whether the finding that search rate is independent of target-set size after practice is a factor of systematic variation in total error rate with set size was examined. After practice, Ss continued to search significantly faster for a single target than for sets composed of 5 or more characters. Incidence of total errors was much lower than in studies in which search rate was found to be independent of set size (parallel processing), even though these studies considered only the occurrence of false-negative errors. Analysis suggests that attainment of parallel processing and a highly accurate performance are incompatible, and verbal instructions alone are not sufficient to control the accuracy levels.

Abstract = {Investigated 2 types of predictive errors, false negatives and false positives, in the Socialization (So) scale of the CPI to determine if they existed as stable groups or whether they merely reflected random error. 27 pairs of delinquent (D) and nondelinquent (ND) Ss matched on low scores on the So scale and 33 matched pairs of high scorers were studied in relation to 41 psychological and social variables. In a secondary analysis 27 pairs of high and low So scale scoring NDs, and 57 pairs of high and low So scoring Ds were compared on the same 41 variables. The number of significant differences in the primary analysis far exceeded the amount expected by chance. The secondary analyses again reveal the diagnostic utility of the So scale. However, the use of a moderator variable, Legal and School Difficulty scale, in combination with the So scale improved prediction to the criterion. It is concluded that the false negatives and false positives "cannot be discounted merely as products of random error," and that they form definite groups. (31 ref.)

Descriptive sentences of varying grammatical form were presented to Ss who were asked to verify them, and the speed of verification was taken as an index of speed of understanding. Active sentences were found to be verified faster than passive, affirmative faster than negative, and true faster than false. The true-false variable was found to interact with the affirmative-negative, indicating that the latter difference is not simply syntactical.

Abstract = {160 White male offenders (aged 16–20 yrs) completed the MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale (MAS), California Psychological Inventory, FIRO—B, Alcohol Use Inventory (AUI), and an intelligence test. Ss were classified according to their reported typical pattern of alcohol intoxication (rare, occasional, weekly, and biweekly) during the previous 12 mo. The classification process included information from the AUI, presentence investigation, and interviews by a probation officer and a psychologist. A comparison of classification patterns with classification rates on the MAS generally support the concurrent validity of the MAS as a measure of alcohol abuse among young at-risk males (i.e., classification accuracy was comparable to that of studies of adult males [75% correct]). The MAC was also sensitive to polydrug use among youth who abuse alcohol. Contrary to previous research, however, it had no practical value for identifying marihuana users. There were significant personality differences between true positives and false negatives. As predicted, the true positive group resembled the emotional extravert (secondary psychopath) character orientation. Personality characteristics of the false negative group resembled those of somewhat immature adolescents, rather than emotional introverts, as had been predicted.

Abstract = {Compared the predictive validity and utility of 2 kindergarten screening approaches (test- and teacher-based), using 678 White males followed longitudinally from kindergarten to Grade 2. Results show that predictions of reading achievement to the end of Grade 2 revealed comparable overall hit rates for the test- and teacher-based approaches. However, the 2 approaches yielded different conditional (posterior) probabilities for predictions of high- vs low-risk status. Teacher-based predictions were characterized by low false-positive rates and high false-negative rates. While predictions of high risk were highly accurate, they were seldom made, which resulted in teachers missing 87% of the severely disabled readers. In contrast, test-based predictions were characterized by higher false-positive rates and lower false-negative rates. While predictions of high risk were less accurate, the screening battery identified a much greater proportion of high-risk Ss, missing only 32% of the severely disabled readers. Combining teacher- and test-based predictions yielded results that were not very different from test-based prediction alone. Findings highlight issues concerning validity and utility that must be considered in evaluating different screening approaches in early identification.

Failure to attach proper weight to false negatives, responsible for the illicit conversion fallacy in reasoning, may be considered an error mainly for avoidance goals and less so for approach goals.

Abstract = {Eight males (including 3 who had previously served in event-related potential [ERP] studies) were shown the terms of simple sentences in sequence (e.g., "A sparrow / is not / a vehicle") and manually indicated whether the sentence was true or false. When the sentence form was affirmative (i.e., "X is a Y"), false sentences produced scalp potentials that were significantly more negative than those for true sentences, in the region of about 250–450 msec following presentation of the sentence object. In contrast, when the sentence form was negative (i.e., "X is not a Y"), it was the true statements that were associated with the ERP negativity. Since both the false–affirmative and the true–negative sentences consist of "mismatched" subject and object terms (e.g., sparrow/vehicle), it is concluded that the negativity in the potentials reflected a semantic mismatch between terms at a preliminary stage of sentence comprehension, rather than the falseness of the sentence taken as a whole. Similarities between the present effects of semantic mismatches and the N400 associated with incongruous sentences are discussed. The pattern of response latencies and of ERPs taken together supported a model of sentence comprehension in which negatives are dealt with only after the proposition to be negated is understood.

Abstract = {Employed the signal-detection paradigm as a model for investigating age-related biological vs cognitive (decision) effects on perceptual behavior. 17 elderly females (aged 65–76 yrs) and 17 high school females (aged 17–18.5 yrs) reported the presence or absence of sugar in threshold level solutions and tap water. It was found that the aged Ss displayed a higher detection threshold. They also obtained a higher (stricter) criterion of decision, fewer false-positives and a greater false-negatives-to-total-errors ratio. These findings are interpreted as strategic behavior motivated by the elderly Ss' greater need to perform well through reducing the error rate. A post-experiment interview found that most Ss equated the term "error" with false-positives only. Therefore, the negative response bias found among the elderly Ss may represent a strategic attempt to reduce the rate of false-positive errors. It is also speculated that it may reflect a need to save energy, since negative responses imply an unwillingness to commit oneself to exert effort.

Abstract = {Hypothesized that (1) truth-functional negation is demonstrable in the speech of 2- and 3-yr-olds and (2) the ability to judge negative statements to be true will be a later development than the abilities of judging misnamings (false affirmative statements) or another's denials (false negative statements) to be false. The development of this coordination was investigated by means of an analysis of the response patterns to true negative sentences by 10 children in 4 age groups (18, 24, 30, and 36 mo). An experimental session for each S consisted of 2 tasks: (1) A word-use pretest determined whether Ss knew the names of the objects, actions, and properties of objects that served as the referents of the stimulus sentences; and (2) a set of sentence-variation tasks, each with 2 phases. Most Ss demonstrated an ability to correct false statements. False affirmative sentences were corrected with logical negations of increasing complexity with age, and false negatives were also frequently corrected, by both negation and complex "yes" responses of oppositional function. Ss' spontaneous responses to true negatives were difficult to interpret, but distinctive response patterns indicated that agreements with such sentences were prevalent by 2½–3 yr old Ss. Results also show the appearance of spontaneous false statement correction prior to true statement agreement and the occurrence of false responses in which Ss played with truth conventions and produced insincere predications.

Abstract = {Reviews the experimental conditions under which contingent negative variation (CNV) is most often recorded, focusing on prior applications in psychopathology. Six cases are presented to illustrate the stability or lability of the measure in specific situations. Despite the great interest in this experimental approach, it is still difficult to establish firm relationships that would permit a better understanding of the neural mechanisms involved. The problem lies, in part, in the demonstrated existence of false negatives (e.g., psychotics with no reduction in wave amplitude) or false positives (e.g., a decidedly flattened CNV recorded from Ss with no abnormal behavior). It was possible, however, to confirm (1) the general finding that psychotics often present an abnormal CNV; (2) that the wave form of these is not much affected by psychotropic treatments; and (3) that certain subcategory contrasts (e.g., neurotics vs psychotics) reveal systematic differences in the CNV, which may better serve as an index of morbidity than for differential diagnosis. The CNV may be only one of several indicators of slowed cerebral potentials among psychotic individuals in response to events occurring within the environment.

Abstract = {Two experiments, involving 55 undergraduates, investigated sentence context effects on picture encoding in sentence–picture verification and picture naming tasks. A picture following a sentence was encoded faster when the 2 were congruent than when they were incongruent. A 3rd experiment, involving 30 Ss, compared 2 conditions: Under the 1st condition, true or false affirmatives and true or false negatives were mixed in each block of presentation; under the 2nd, different sentence types were presented in different blocks. Errors committed in verification were largely negation errors, but seldom falsification errors. There was a decrease of falsification time, but a resistance to change in negation time, from the mixed to the blocked presentation. Results are interpreted to mean that falsification time results from a longer time required to encode the picture and confirm the truth index value in false affirmatives and true negatives, whereas negation time and negation errors result from a response-suppression operation.

Abstract = {Discusses the relationship between changes in delinquency prevalence over time and prediction error. Published data from a 21-yr British longitudinal study by M. E. Wadsworth (1978–1979) are used to exemplify the formal relationships that are derived. Statistically, as prevalence increases, there will be a relative increase in false negative errors and a decrease in false positive errors; the relationship is independent of prediction accuracy. Substantively, this means that as delinquency prevalence increases, imperfect prediction models will move toward "missing" more actual delinquents (increasing false negatives) and "mistaking" fewer actual nondelinquents (decreasing false positives). Some characterizations of differentially weighting the costs of false negative and false positive errors are presented in terms of intervention and nonintervention policies and decisions.

Classification accuracy was 45% for alcohol abuse, 49% for marihuana use, and 66% for related multiple substance use. There were few differences in personality functioning as measured by the California Psychological Inventory, between true positives and false negatives. Both groups exhibited adolescent qualities (irresponsibility, attraction to pleasure seeking, and minor rebelliousness). False negatives appeared to be less impulsive and somewhat less secure about themselves than true positives. Both groups reported alcohol to enhance a sense of well-being but not to reduce inhibitions in social relationships. True positives tended to use alcohol to help cope with problems in personal relationships, such as rejection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Cernovsky found that, for the MMPI MacAndrew Alcoholism scale (MAC), false negatives are characterized by higher Repression (R) scale scores than true positives and are characteristic of nonsubstance abusing psychiatric patients and suggests that the low MAC/high R sign may be useful in detecting false negatives. Stable personality correlates that differentiated false negatives from true positives were identified. It is suggested that a homogeneous subgroup exists within the substance-dependent population.

It has previously been supposed that the effects of false negative and false positive criterion errors on the findings of concept development studies are different, but it is shown that, in fact, both forms of error have the same effect on the null hypotheses tested in such studies. It is concluded that the correct solution to the criterion problem is to select the criterion with the lowest error rate, regardless of whether the actual errors being committed are false positives or false negatives. Existing data are consistent with the assumption that error rates for judgments-only criteria are lower than corresponding error rates for judgments-plus-explanations criteria.

Abstract = {Examined the strategy employed by 120 Ss at 3 academic levels (Grades 1–3, 4–6, and 7–8) when completing binary statements. 32 incomplete binary statements representing 4 statement conditions (true affirmative, TA; true negative, TN; false affirmative, FA; and false negative, FN) were administered. A response-index change model is postulated as the strategy employed by these Ss when completing binary statements. According to this model, the factor that caused response time to differ across the 4 statement conditions was the number of times the child was required to change the set of his response index. The S began the task of completing a binary statement by reading and encoding the incomplete statement. He then selected the numeral that corresponded to the adjective "odd" or "even" contained in the predicate of the incomplete statement. The child's response index was then set to respond with this numeral. What the S did at this point depended upon the type of statement condition with which he was working. If the S was completing a TA statement, no response-index change was required. He simply gave as his answer the numeral to which his response index was set. If the child was completing an FA statement or a TN statement, one response-index change was required. If the child was completing an FN statement, 2 response-index changes were required.

A claim for drug-class specificity has been made because conventional anxiolytics reduced rearings at doses that did not reduce steps climbed, while nonanxiolytics affected both measures in parallel. In the present study, using male CD-1 mice, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol, alprazolam, meprobamate, buspirone, CGS 9896, ketanserine, tracazolate, phencyclidine, nicotine, morphine, phenacetin, pentylenetetrazol, and FG 7142 were tested using the staircase paradigm. Results indicate an equivocal false negative for alprazolam, a clear false negative for buspirone, and a clear false positive for morphine.

Abstract = {Reviews 5 bedside screening tests that use an interview format and require brief administration times, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, a cognitive capacity screening examination, a dementia rating scale, a mental status questionnaire, and the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Findings indicate that the tests all have adequate inter-rater reliability, and adequate test-retest reliability has been established for 3 of the tests. All of the tests show close correspondence with clinical diagnoses of delirium and dementia and are useful for the diagnosis and quantification of these syndromes. All of the tests have substantial false-negative rates, with false-negative errors frequent among patients with focal lesions, particularly of the right hemisphere. However, they do not detect many types of cognitive deficit that may bear critically on differential diagnosis and case management.

Abstract = {Investigated the possibility that R. Wallasech's (1979) 20% false negative rate found on A. Canter's (see record [rid]1964-06348-001[/rid]) Background Interference Procedure (BIP) can be explained by one or more of the following moderator variables: age at onset of symptoms, etiology, type of symptoms, severity of generalized background dysrhythmia, and locus of lesion. 141 epileptics (mean age 36.8 yrs) completed the BIP and the Trail Making Test (Trails A and B). Results show that none of the moderator variables correlated significantly with the BIP scores, contrary to expectations. The BIP's nearly 50% false negative rate was much higher than that of the Trail Making Test, using either the E. W. Russell et al (1970) or the R. M. Reitan (1964) cutting scores for Trails A (33% and 21%, respectively) or Trails B (35% and 28.5%, respectively). The BIP often does not agree with abnormal neurological diagnoses but often does agree with psychiatric diagnoses of organic brain syndrome (OBS). The authors argue that this is due to the BIP's normative history and to its sensitivity to organic concreteness. It is suggested that future BIP validity studies include a behavioral measure of OBS as criterion. (41 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the empirical validity of the MacAndrew scale of the MMPI (C. MacAndrew; see record [rid]1966-02941-001[/rid]) in 200 16–20 yr old White males convicted of misdemeanor offenses who were classified according to their pattern of alcohol intoxication. Classification results were comparable to those from studies of adult men—true positive = 80%, false negative = 20%, true negative = 81%, and false positive = 19%. An empirical cluster analysis of factor scores from the California Psychological Inventory yielded 14 personality types. About 56% of these cases resembled 2 character orientations (emotional extraversion or emotional introversion) that were hypothesized by MacAndrew (1981) to mediate addiction-proneness among males. However, 38.7% of these Ss were not alcohol misusers. The hypothesis that emotional introverts tend to be classified as false negatives was not supported—true positive = 79% and false negative = 21%. Although MacAndrew's formulation of 2 character orientations has heuristic value, the present study found alcohol misuse among adolescents with other personality characteristics. Consistent with earlier research by MacAndrew (see record [rid]1982-26025-001[/rid]), the present study found no evidence of high levels of emotional tension in the form of anxiety or depression among adolescent alcohol misusers.

In Exp I, English-speaking Ss were given a sentence-variation task in which the following 4 sentence types were used to describe 36 pictures of common items: true affirmative, false affirmative, true negative (TN), and false negative. The results show that a majority of Ss under 5 yrs had difficulty with negative sentences, particularly TN sentences, indicating a lack of explicit understanding of truth-functional negation as defined in logic. In Exp II, a cross-linguistic replication of Exp I was attempted with Korean-speaking Ss. Despite some cross-linguistic differences in the negation system, the Korean-speaking Ss showed essentially the same pattern of results, suggesting that the development in question proceeds within the general limit set by the general cognitive development.

Abstract = {Reviews and reanalyzes an application by M. E. Ford (see record [rid]1980-05161-001[/rid]) of the multitrait-multimethod matrix developed by D. Campbell and D. Fiske (see record [rid]1960-00103-001[/rid]) to correlational data on the concept of egocentrism. The criteria by which reliability is evaluated, the interpretation of negative evidence in convergent/discriminant validation, and task selection and scoring are examined. Problems associated with statistical control of age in developmental data and with age-appropriate assessment are also outlined. To avoid both false-negative and false-positive conclusions in construct validation research, developmentalists should give greater weight to psychometric considerations in task construction, data collection, and meta-analyses. It is suggested that the correlational data in the literature cannot support an evaluation of either convergent or discriminant validity of the concept of egocentrism. Separate sets of egocentrism tasks for assessing spatial, affective, and cognitive/communicative egocentrism in early, middle, and later childhood are suggested as a way of approaching the validation process.

Abstract = {In Exp I, 48 undergraduates were divided into 4 groups, 3 of which enacted a mock crime. Two of these guilty groups were trained in the use of a countermeasure, either biting the tongue (pain countermeasure) or pressing the toes against the floor (muscle countermeasure) during the control question zones of the control question test (CQT). All countermeasure Ss were given extensive information about the nature of the CQT. Results show that no significant effects for countermeasures were found. In Exp II, 57 Ss were divided into 3 groups, 2 of which enacted a mock crime, to assess the effects of additional training and concurrent use of both countermeasures. Results show that countermeasure Ss produced 47% false negative outcomes as compared to no false negatives for guilty control Ss. False negative outcomes occurred when Ss were able to produce physiological responses that were larger to control questions than to relevant questions. Findings should be qualified by the possibility that the countermeasure task would be more difficult if the relevant questions dealt with a real crime in an actual investigation. It is concluded that a substantial number of Ss can be trained to defeat a CQT in a laboratory paradigm. (33 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the comments made by R. J. Teunisse (see record [rid]2005-00996-026[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2004-11829-008[/rid]). The author's first concern was that the 2 questions we used to assess Musical Hallucinations (MH) may have caused a biased rate of MH in different mental diagnoses, due to more false-negative responses among psychotic patients. However, as mentioned in the Method section, following the 2 direct questions on MH/MO (Musical Obsessions), the patients should also have been able to provide many more details on their past MH experience. These details either confirmed or refuted the occurrence of MH/MO and are currently under final analysis, with the aim of disentangling the MH/MO dilemma. The Geha Short Interview for Musical Hallucinations is an interview with patients, so explanations such as "music that others could not hear" and "where there was no radio, CD player, or record player in the room" were usually added. In addition, our clinical experience with MH patients does not support the prejudiced idea that psychotic patients will hide and underreport their MH. Regarding the second debate of how to differentiate true MH from pseudo-MH, namely MO, it makes clinical sense to adhere to the tradition of assessing the degree of vigor, vividness, and ego-dystonicity. Along this line, we are currently analyzing our series of over 51 MH/MO cases, hoping to provide empirical data to support the rather theoretical ideas presented in our article.

The Diagnostic Interview Schedule was used on the alcoholic mothers to diagnose lifetime psychiatric disorders. A history of alcohol related medical problems in the mother was associated with reporting maternal alcoholism. Being African-American; having a history of suicide attempts in the mother; and having a good maternal posttreatment outcome were associated with false-negative reports. Adding multiple offspring informants increased sensitivity to 86%. Female alcoholic offspring tended to underreport maternal alcoholism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Ss were trained to 95% accuracy in a 2-bar operant procedure with a tandem schedule of food reinforcement. NIC was a more salient component (85% drug-appropriate responding) than was MDZ (47%) in the compound stimulus. Ss were then tested with the benzodiazepine and NIC antagonists flumazenil and mecamylamine alone or in combination. Flumazenil alone had no effect whereas mecamylamine alone produced a significant but incomplete block, explainable by the greater salience of the NIC cue component. The antagonists in combination produced greater blockade than did mecamylamine on its own. Results suggest that "false negative" results in drug discrimination experiments may be obtained with antagonists when a training drug produces a stimulus with more than 1 component.

Abstract = {Reviews some fundamental issues about the nature, methods, and consequences of investigative interviewing by police of suspects, witnesses, victims, and complainants. Recent legal developments in England have led to improved protection for suspects detained for interviewing as well as improved interviewing procedures and techniques. Emphasis is now on gathering information rather than obtaining confessions. It is argued that coercive and psychologically manipulative interviewing techniques can have negative consequences, including false confession, the undermining of public confidence in the criminal justice system, resentment and hostility among defendants, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and confessions being ruled inadmissible in court. There is a fine balance between facilitating the duties of the police to prevent and investigate crimes and answering the needs and protecting the rights of suspects and witnesses.

Abstract = {Assessed the validity and reliability of the NCSE (R. J. Kiernan et al, 1987) in 192 psychiatric patients. Analyses revealed that demographic and general health factors need to be taken into consideration in interpreting NCSE results. Predictive accuracy of the screening items for subsequent performance on metric items across different scales ranged from good to poor. Comparison of success vs failure on the screen for Construction scale with scores on metric items for this scale revealed a high number of false negative errors made using the screening item. Indices of internal consistency of the Orientation scale were adequate. Factor analysis identified a subset of scales that assess the patients' functional capacity in dealing with demands of everyday environment. Test–retest reliability of the NCSE assessed on a subsample of 28 Ss was high for 7 scales, whereas low stability was demonstrated by Construction, Memory, and Calculation scales.

Abstract = {"The present investigation equates the specificity of all statements, and hence eliminates the disjunctive implication of false affirmatives and true negatives by utilizing the mutually exclusive classes of odd and even numbers as material. Two tasks were used, (a) 'verification,' i.e., determining whether a statement about a number is true or false, and (b) 'construction,' i.e., stating a number to make a statement either true or false. In both tasks the form of a statement (affirmative or negative) was significant at the 0.001 level at the end of practice. In the construction task the truth value of a statement (true or false) was also significant at the 0.001 level, but in the verification task it was not significant."

Abstract = {The major series of data in this study was secured by administering a true-false test followed immediately by a parallel multiple-choice test to a group of students in the University of Michigan. The procedure was designed to present experimental materials identical in subject matter and variable in form in such a way that the differential response was due only to the form and not to the content of the statement. In this way the negative influence of the false statement in the true-false test was isolated. The evidence clearly indicated that the immediate effect of the false statement was negative and detrimental. The author concludes that the negative effect of the true-false test should be counteracted. One proposed method is that the student should correct the errors on his examination, either on his own initiative or in collaboration with his instructor.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Fuchs et al (see record [rid]2004-18763-003[/rid]). The authors introduce the tupaias with a brief discussion of textbook-style stress physiology, including glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus. Many interesting issues are mentioned, and Miczek raises a few of these unresolved questions. Probably the strongest exaggeration in this paper is the bold statement that 'therapy that works in humans, also works in the animal model'. The poor success of current therapeutic interventions in human affective disorders is precisely the reason for developing new models and new targets--and Fuchs and co-workers acknowledge this point later in the review. So far, the best treatment response in humans is to ECT, but unfortunately, even after decades of work with the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews, this information is still missing. Moreover, 'false negatives' and 'correct rejections' remain to be demonstrated in the tree shrew model. In order to characterize the chronic psychosocial stress model in tree shrews, it will be necessary to show at least some minimal dose-dependent effects of clomipramine, not just similar blood levels as in human clinical responses. Single-dose pharmacology is treacherous and, often, quite misleading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Compared the validity of self-reported tobacco use among students in schools with a smoking prevention program vs that in reference schools. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used, with the 1st factor a pipeline manipulation consisting of pipeline (PLC) vs control condition, and the 2nd factor treatment status consisting of treatment vs reference schools. In each school, half of the 9th-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to a PLC and half served as controls. The main effect for PLC and the significant interaction between treatment and PLCs were not significant. Using saliva thiocyanate as an objective measure of smoking status suggested differential false negative reporting where Ss in the reference group falsely claimed to be nonsmokers more frequently than in the treatment community. The reporting bias by the pipeline procedure alone appears to have masked treatment outcome effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Followed 15 seriously injured accident victims (aged 20–82 yrs) at 9- to 10-wk intervals for 9 mo after admission to a community shock-trauma center. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on a structured psychiatric interview. Six Ss met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In 2 cases, PTSD was not diagnosed until 3–6 mo after injury, primarily because of severe avoidant symptomatology. Diagnosis in 2 Ss would probably have been missed without frequent follow-up interviews. Findings suggest that avoidant symptoms of PTSD can interfere with diagnosis. Frequent follow-up after a traumatic event may reduce the level of false negatives in population studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Disclosure was strongly associated with the attitude taken by the child's caretaker toward the possibility of abuse. Children whose caretakers accepted the possibility that their child might have been sexually abused disclosed at a rate almost 3.5 times as great as those whose caretakers denied any possibility of abuse (63% vs 17%). Aside from their STD, many of the abused children presented as free from any specifically suspicious abuse symptoms, suggesting that reliance on single interviews and identification of "red flags" cannot be expected to identify many hidden victims.

Abstract = {Discusses the use of the plethysmograph (PLES) as a measurement of erectile response in male sex offenders. The PLES is the best objective measure of male arousal, as blood flow to the genital area does not seem to be influenced by factors other than sexual eroticism. The PLES is useful in identifying Ss who manifest high levels of arousal to inappropriate sexual stimuli while exhibiting low levels of arousal to appropriate sexual stimuli. The PLES has its limitations, though: overinterpretation of data (i.e., predictions of guilt, innocence, or recidivism), lack of standards for training and interpretation of data, lack of standardization, and susceptibility of data to false negatives and positives. Misuse of the PLES is a major concern. Using the PLES to predict innocence, guilt, or likelihood of reoffending is beyond the scope of the test's validity.

Abstract = {Examined the efficacy of both a posthypnotic (PTH) polygraph countermeasure suggestion and a PTH ideomotor lie detection suggestion within an analog preemployment screening context. 45 Ss (aged 18–37 yrs) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 equal-sized groups, controlling for their performance on the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A. Ss assigned to one of the groups received the PTH suggestion that the S's index finger would rise whenever he or she lied during the polygraph test; Ss in another group were given a PTH countermeasure designed to help them appear innocent whenever they lied; and those in the 3rd group were not given either hypnotic intervention. None of the Ss given the ideomotor suggestion raised his or her finger when he or she lied during the polygraph test. The countermeasure suggestion also was ineffective, as was demonstrated by its failure to produce significantly more false negative responses.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments with 80 undergraduates that involved an initial word-identification task in which the acoustic signal was degraded by either 50% or 60% compression of the recorded words. A control group was tested at the original recording rate (0% compression). The compression manipulation was successful in increasing the number of identification errors. During the 2nd stage of the experiments, words were read at a normal rate. In Exp 1, Ss indicated whether each word had appeared on the prior list; in Exp 2, Ss estimated the number of times each word had been read on the prior list. The false-negative rate decreased and frequency ratings increased as a function of the number of prior presentations (1, 2, or 3) of the target words. The effect of repetitions was present even for words that had been misperceived. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. In 49 families, probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Results suggest that fragile X syndrome results from a 2-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis.

The MMDT was varied by difficulty of the task and the presence of an interpolated task. Approximately 80% of the Ss succeeded in escaping detection by the MMDT. The more difficult MMDT versions were more effective, suggesting that malingering Ss were wary of transparently simple tasks and chose not to feign impairment on those tasks. Results underscore the need to consider the risk of false-negative classification in the use of the SVT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

To evaluate the proposed procedure, the relationship between subtest and full test scores was estimated, using test score data from 203 students in Grades 2–5 who had received the full WISC—R. A subtest screening score of 52 was both efficient and accurate, minimizing false negatives while saving up to 1 hr of psychologist's time per child recommended for testing.

Abstract = {The present study provides a first attempt to estimate the validity of the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT) in real-life criminal investigations. Skin resistance responses in GKT records of 50 innocent and 48 guilty Ss, for whom actual truth was established by confession, were analyzed by two methods. On the basis of an a priori decision rule, 98% of the innocent and 42% of the guilty Ss were correctly classified. Signal detection measures based on various possible decision rules indicated that the distribution of guilty Ss was highly differentiated from the distribution of innocent Ss. An optimal decision rule yielded correct classifications for 94% of the innocent Ss and 65% of the guilty Ss. These results suggest that the GKT could be a useful investigative tool that protects innocent suspects from being falsely classified as guilty. The false-negative identifications were accounted for in terms of the realistic conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We performed a short literature search and located a pivotal article by Bryson, Rogers, and Fombonne (2003) which pointed out that very few PDD screens including the PDDST have been subjected to rigorous evaluation of their specificity and sensitivity. Next, we performed an informal content analysis of the PDDST-II and found that a number of the items are prone to confound by ADHD presentation. Lastly, on the basis of the foregoing information, we decided not to screen for PDD at all but to accept all referrals wherein a suspicion of ASD exists (thus eliminating the problem of false negatives).

Two subsequent studies failed to confirm this finding.

Various points help to interpret these discrepancies: false-positive and false-negative results may arise in case-control association studies owing to population stratification bias; the linkage disequilibrium between the A218C polymorphism and a pathogenic functional variant in the TPH gene may not exist in the British population; higher frequency of the A allele in French patients in the original study may have caused dissimilar patient samples; the genetic validity of the "bipolar" phenotype is unknown, results for patients having attempted suicide reported by Kirov et al suggest that suicidal behavior may be the relevant phenotype. And finally, increasing the number of genetic markers and phenotypes tested in a single population increases the false-positive rate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

We concur that optimal treatment interventions should begin as early in fully declared psychosis as possible. Although we differ in our interpretation of the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) research, we concur that there are many other reasons to intervene early in psychotic disorders. We recognize that post-illness early intervention efforts are categorically different from interventions which precede the emergence of the full psychotic syndrome, and that the latter pose potential problems of negative consequences for false-positive cases. We do not believe, given the current stage of knowledge, that it is appropriate to apply early intervention strategies to asymptomatic subjects or prepsychotic cases who are not seeking help.

Abstract = {Reports an error in the original article by Michael Hoefler et al. (Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 2005[Sep], Vol 40[9], 681-690). The name of the second author was given wrong. Her correct name is "Tanja Briickl". (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2006-04133-007[/rid]). Background: When assessing the association between a factor X and a subsequent outcome Y in observational studies, the question that arises is what are the variables to adjust for to reduce bias due to confounding for causal inference on the effect of X on Y. Disregarding such factors is often a source of overestimation because these variables may affect both X and Y. On the other hand, adjustment for such variables can also be a source of underestimation because such variables may be the causal consequence of X and part of the mechanism that leads from X to Y. Methods: In this paper, we present a simple method to compute control variables in the presence of age at onset data on both X and a set of other variables. Using these age at onset data, control variables are computed that adjust only for conditions that occur prior to X. This strategy can be used in prospective as well as in survival analysis. Our method is motivated by an argument based on the counterfactual model of a causal effect. Results: The procedure is exemplified by examining of the relation between panic attack and the subsequent incidence of MDD. Conclusions: The results reveal that the adjustment for all other variables, irrespective of their temporal relation to X, can yield a false negative result (despite unconsidered confounders and other sources of bias).

Application of the ICD-10 guidelines to Ss who had been previously diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the ICD-9 did not yield any false-positive or false-negative results. Apparently, the ICD-9 and the ICD-10 are not widely divergent. The presence of Schneider's first-rank symptoms, on which the ICD-10 guidelines rely, suggests a common core of symptomatology across cultures. However, caution is necessary in detecting these symptoms in cultures in which socioculturally shared beliefs resemble first-rank symptoms.

Each questionnaire type either included or did not include an orienting paragraph and saliency-control questions. The funnel questionnaire was the most accurate method of assessing awareness; it eliminated the problem of "false negatives" remaining in the data, and it did not identify a large number of "false-positive awares." The belief that an extended-funnel questionnaire will suggest too much demand characteristic awareness is challenged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Of 49 Ss who failed the battery, 25 were matched with 25 controls and were examined in detail neurologically and psychologically. The battery distinguished normals (who passed) from those who failed. In the latter group, 2 types were found: (a) Ss clinically diagnosed as having MBD and (b) Ss thought to be immature. Some of the immature Ss improved on readministration of the test battery 8 mo. later and were expected to show continued improvement but difficulty in Grade I. 3 false positives and 1 false negative were found. On 11 of the 12 tests the mean scores of the immature were better than those of the MBD. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied (a) the direction in which cross-modal discrimination is better (from vision to touch or vice versa), and (b) the nature and function of the mechanisms involved. Ss were 20 undergraduates in a pretest, and 40 undergraduate and graduate students in the main experiment. 2 sets of stimulus items differing in the degree to which they elicited verbal labels were used. The independent variables were perception and discrimination modalities, stimulus "nameability," and label use. On the basis of total error scores, perception modality, label use, nameability, perception * discrimination, and perception * label use were significant effects. The pattern of errors, however, indicates that verbal factors may be more strongly associated with false negatives than false positives, and more important as intramodal than as cross-modal mediators. Label use may either facilitate or depress performance, depending on the perceptual-cognitive operations that precede label "attainment."

Abstract = {A central problem in the use of children's behavior inventories involves the verity of endorsements made by reporters. Therefore, procedures for constructing, administering, and scoring a deviant behavior inventory were developed so as to minimize and control over- and under-reporting error. To minimize false negatives, comprehensive coverage, a not sure response category, a re-sort procedure, and use of 5 reporters were included. To control false positives, clarity and specificity of working, a detailed inquiry, and independent validity judgments were included. In 20 deviant behavior inventory assessments of school children a considerable amount of both types of error was demonstrated when measured against the independent validity judgments, suggesting caution in the use of similar behavioral assessments which neglect to control for such error.

Abstract = {In the belief that the diagnostic validity of Rorschach methods would gain from formalizing the judgmental processes of clinicians, 14 score patterns were constructed from 8 Rorschach variables, each pattern designed to characterize patients in 1 of 3 broad diagnostic categories, Schizophrenic, Borderline Psychotic, or "Other." A random sample of 196 patients of a VA mental hygiene clinic was drawn from clinic files. The "pattern diagnoses" obtained by applying the pattern system to their Rorschach scores were found significantly related to diagnoses formulated by the examining psychologists and by the clinic intake staff. More patients diagnosed schizophrenic by the pattern method engaged in austistic behavior than patients with other pattern diagnoses. The diagnostic efficiency of the pattern method, measured in terms of ability to reach a definite diagnosis, proportion of correct diagnoses, and proportion of false positive errors, did not differ significantly from the diagnostic efficiency of the psychological examiners, and differed significantly from the psychiatrists' diagnostic efficiency only in producing more "indeterminate" diagnoses. The diagnostic validity of the patterns was considered to be established, but their usefulness as a clinical tool depends heavily on population base rates and the relative costs of false positive and false negative diagnostic errors.

@article{2005-09710-00119780101,
Abstract = {Recent research progress warrants the use of biological variables for developing psychiatric diagnostic systems just as biological measures are used in other branches of medicine. In fact, psychiatrists already bow to internal medicine when biological indicators of tertiary syphilis, lupus, or hypothyroidism are present. Even in areas not yet ceded to infectious disease, immunology or endocrinology, biological factors are used to make diagnoses. Though unsanctioned, the use of lithium carbonate response in differentially diagnosing affective disorder and schizophrenia is not uncommon. In this case, the clinical psychiatrist may be conceptually step ahead of the biological researcher, because he has identified a diagnostic group homogeneous with respect to a salient biological feature and is willing to ignore the symptom heterogeneity. While he might write "affective disorder" in the chart, the implied diagnosis is really "lithium sensitive behavioral syndrome." As classification is the first step in science, diagnosis is the most fundamental problem in psychiatry. Biological researchers have an opportunity to develop new modes of psychiatric diagnoses that go beyond the traditional categories and draw upon new knowledge from the neurosciences. Today's biological researcher searching for a laboratory test for "schizophrenia" is not going to find it. Multiple etiologies, false negative symptom elicitation, false positive symptom expression, and the lack of external validating criteria all prevent the identification of a homogeneous schizophrenic group for study. A laboratory test for "dopamine disease," however, is a possibility with current technology. Whether dopamine disease or other biologically based diagnoses are clinically useful diagnoses needs to be determined with new research strategies.

Abstract = {Assessed 2 psychological tests sensitive to cortical brain dysfunction—the Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVO) and E. Weigl's (1941) Color-Form Sorting Test (CFST)—for biases toward aging in a psychiatric population. 45 younger (20–39 yrs old) and 27 older (40–72 yrs old) hospitalized psychiatric patients were equated for verbal intelligence (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) and education and compared on these 2 cognitive tests. It is noted that psychological tests are routinely administered to aging populations, despite warnings of high false positive and false negative rates. Results reveal that younger and older Ss differed on the 2 tests, when other relevant variables were controlled. Younger Ss scored better on both tests, organizing perceptual items better (HVO) and shifting concepts to a greater degree (CFST). Issues related to the cautious use of cognitive tests with the aged and to the decline of right-hemisphere functions due to aging are discussed.

Abstract = {Presents the 3rd of a series of papers by the present authors (1983, 1984) on techniques that can be used as aids to decision making by clinicians. It is accepted that errors of misclassifications, however small, can occur in clinical decisions, but it cannot be assumed that the importance associated with false positive errors is the same as that for false negatives. The relative importance of these 2 types of error is frequently implied by a decision maker in the different weighting factors or utilities he or she assigns to the alternative consequences of decisions. Formal procedures are available by which it is possible to make explicit in numerical form the value or worth of the outcome of a decision process. The 2 principal methods for generating utilities as associated with clinical decisions are described. The concept and application of utility is then expanded from a unidimensional to a multidimensional problem where, for example, one variable may be state of health and another monetary assets. When combined with the principles of subjective probability and test criterion selection, the consequent use of utilities completes the framework on which the general Bayesian model of clinical decision making is based. The 5 main stages in this model are described, and applications are illustrated with clinical examples from the field of ophthalmology.

Abstract = {Examined the stability of standard score and probability method sociometric group assignments over a 2-yr period among 211 children initially in the 5th grade. The popular, neglected, and controversial sociometric groups evidenced low stability of group membership over intervals of approximately 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo, while the rejected group evidenced slightly higher short-term stability. These findings are attributed to measurement error and to the failure of both classification systems to identify groups with homogeneous social reputation profiles. Social role scores contributed to the prediction of stable group membership in the rejected and controversial classification, although these scores added little to the prediction of stable popular and neglected group membership. Stability over short intervals could be used to enhance the prediction of stability over longer periods; however, this procedure resulted in the classification of numerous false positives and false negatives. The instability of sociometric group assignments completed with the standard score and probability methods indicates that researchers should be cautious about the use of classifications based on only one data collection, and that the selection of children for both clinical intervention and further nomothetic research may require alternative assessment procedures.

Abstract = {Describes the development of the Wimbledon Self-Report Scale (WSRS), a self-rating scale for the detection of mood disturbance that is based on feelings. The WSRS provides a catalog of the patient's adverse emotions for use in counseling and detects levels of mood disturbance that warrant further exploration. The classifications yielded by the scale are reliable and false positive and false negative rates are low. When applied to a sample of 83 patients hospitalized with substantial physical illness, the WSRS scores seem unaffected by sex or by age within the 18–65 yr age range.

Abstract = {The diagnosis of multiple personality disorder (MPD) is fraught with difficulties leading to a frequent false negative diagnosis and an occasional false positive diagnosis. Proper diagnostic evaluation of a patient suspected of having MPD requires a familiarity with MPD, hypnotic phenomena, and a wide variety of other clinical syndromes. The clinician must use collateral data from old records and other individuals and must provide sufficient time for the evaluation. Extreme caution is urged in forensic contexts. The use of extremely suggestive interviewing and/or hypnotic techniques is contraindicated. At times prolonged observation in the hospital or over the course of therapy is required. Patient factors involved in misdiagnosis include distrust, fear of being labeled crazy, insistence on secrecy, amnesia, and conscious or unconscious deception.

Abstract = {The diagnosis and treatment of depression have recently been aided by a number of laboratory tests, such as the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and measurement of plasma levels of tricyclics. In the case of plasma drug levels, the principal determinant is dosage, which cannot be thought of as a homeostatically controlled physiologic system with narrowly defined limits. The present authors argue that low or high values are not always abnormal, and "normal" values do not always reflect normality. Laboratory tests such as the DST sometimes yield false positive and false negative results. The authors discuss these and other conceptual issues underlying the use of the DST and plasma level measures of antidepressants in psychiatry.

The principal predictors of delinquency were the parents' family management and techniques (supervision and discipline), the child's conduct problems, parental criminality, and the child's poor academic performance. The best predictors of recidivism were reports of the child's stealing or lying, followed by the child's own problem behavior or prior delinquency. Data are presented to show the earliest age of the child at which these predictors have been measured. Results of the prediction data are used to demonstrate utility functions in which false positive and false negative errors are minimized.

Abstract = {Clinical and statistical predictions of 6 categories of recidivism among 198 adult male felony probationers (average age 27.99 yrs) were compared and combined, both before and after correcting for the restricted range of the predictor variables. The statistical composite consistently outperformed decision makers for the undifferentiated recidivism criteria of arrest and conviction. The opposite state of affairs was observed to exist for all 3 indices of violent recidivism but only after correction for restriction of range. The combination of both variables tended not to produce significant increases in criterion variance compared to the superior predictor alone, the major exception being incarceration for any offense. Decision makers performed best when forecasting violent criminal conduct that resulted in incarceration, and this contingency table was subjected to a detailed analysis of the outcomes of prediction. This included 2 methods of estimating the probable probationary performance of 141 members of the initial sample who were sentenced to prison, and consideration of the utilities associated with false positive and false negative errors. Partially because of the seeming impossibility of achieving perfect prediction, it is concluded that there is a need for decision-making guidelines that include only those criminological variables that can serve the dual purpose of predicting recidivism and indicating which offenders are the most deserving of imprisonment as punishment.

The mean level of severity of symptoms of the groups with and without chronic complaints was not significantly different. However, Ss with chronic complaints showed a significantly lower mean GHQ score than Ss without chronic complaints. The mean CGHQ scores of the 2 groups did not differ, suggesting that the CGHQ is a better indicator of the severity of the chronic psychiatric state than the GHQ. The revised scoring procedure resulted in a decrease in the number of false negatives. This reduction was achieved at the expense of a small increase in the number of false positives. Altogether, the revised scoring procedure proved to be only marginally better. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The following conclusions are presented: (1) There are 2 broad classes of male alcoholics—those who fall into the Extraversion+ (E+) Neuroticism+ (N+) quadrant of secondary psychopathy and those who fall into the E– N+ quadrant of neurotic introversion. (2) Unselected runs of male alcoholics populate these 2 quadrants in a stable ratio of 17:3, respectively.

Abstract = {Examined the responses of 89 physical child abusers (mean age 26 yrs) and 108 comparison Ss to determine if the Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory Inconsistency (IC) scale has any utility in the screening for physical child abuse. While results indicate the CAP Inventory IC scale scores were significantly higher for the physical child abuse group, a series of discriminant analyses indicated that the IC scale did not account for any meaningful variance after variance related to child abuse factors was removed. Further, data show that dependence on the IC scale alone for physical child abuse screening purposes could be expected to produce excessive false positive and false negative classifications.

Abstract = {This study tested whether the MMPI K correction would reduce false negatives among patients and increase false positives among nonpatients. Ss were 214 psychiatric inpatients and 289 nonpatients. As L. M. Hsu (see record [rid]1986-28964-001[/rid]) predicted, nonpatients' profiles violated statistical normality more often than did patients'. However, kappa agreement rates between corrected and uncorrected profiles were .76 for patients, .86 for nonpatients, and .89 overall, showing that the K correction had little effect on the frequencies of primed profiles. Because profile shape was often changed by the K correction, it was concluded that its routine use may not always be helpful. An unexpected finding, in support of research by L. N. Robins et al (see PA, Vol 73:1363) on lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders, was that 30% of nonpatients' uncorrected profiles were primed.

ADD Ss classified as abnormal on the basis of the CPT scored significantly below Ss classified as normal on measures of abstract reasoning and logical problem solving, simple verbal reasoning, nonverbal problem solving, and simple arithmetic skills. The non-ADD group contained a high proportion of Ss with CPT performance outside of the normal range.

Abstract = {A study was designed to determine the discriminative efficiency of the Bayley Mental and Motor Scales for classifying infants as neurologically suspicious and neurologically normal. Two groups (105 Ss found to be normal and 89 found to be suspect of neurological impairment) were formed on the basis of results from comprehensive neurological examinations performed at ages 1 and 7 yrs. Three discriminant function analyses were conducted, one for each scale separately and a 3rd incorporating both scales using a stepwise procedure. Efficiency was measured in terms of number of correct and incorrect classifications, false positive and false negative errors, and validity coefficients. Comparisons among the analyses were examined by means of relative discriminative power and incremental validity. Findings suggest that the Motor Scale provides the most accurate identification of infants with suspected neurological impairments. A significant likelihood discriminant function derived from both scales yielded some additional discriminative power. The law of parsimony, however, dictated the use of the single Motor Scale.

Abstract = {In this paper, difficulties surrounding the definition and determination of human death are regarded as assessment problems to which concepts familiar to many psychologists are applicable. These concepts include multiple operationalism, exclusionary screening, false positive and false negative errors, and the idea of a "cutting score" for decisions regarding death. Recommendation is made for the examination of implicit weights used by physicians in combining information from various sources, to arrive at decisions regarding clinical death. Recent technological advances and concomitant social pressures have changed the nature of the assessment of death from a primarily criterion-related to a largely construct-oriented procedure.

Abstract = {Theories in "soft" areas of psychology (e.g., clinical, counseling, social, personality, school, and community) lack the cumulative character of scientific knowledge because they tend neither to be refuted nor corroborated, but instead merely fade away as people lose interest. Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests") are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94% success with no false negatives.

The 1st author argues that if the dolls or comparable play materials were not available, some sexually abused children would not be able to communicate their sexual concerns and experiences and, therefore, could not be protected by the courts. The 2nd author cites research showing evidence of false positives and false negatives with the use of these dolls and contends that techniques using these dolls seem to allow for shortcuts both in time and in training. She further asserts that for diagnostic purposes in ordinary child psychiatric practice, there is nothing superior to unstructured play and open-ended questions, which require high levels of training and expertise to administer.

Abstract = {Studied 10 psychogenic patients (PGs), 10 organic patients (OGs), and 10 sexually functional volunteers (all aged 21–60 yrs). Waking assessment of erectile responses using erotic films and self-stimulation differentiated psychogenic and organogenic erectile dysfunction (OED). The high number of false positives among the OGs and false negatives among PGs indicate that there is no single biological marker for OED. On a continuous cognitive measure PGs consistently underestimated, while OGs overestimated, their amount of erection. Data suggest that organogenic and psychogenic are not dichotomous categories and that a multifaceted assessment is necessary for successful medical or psychological treatment planning.

Abstract = {Devised a classroom observation code that would identify hyperactive children reliably. A 14-category observation code was used to record the classroom behavior of 60 6–12 yr old children referred to an outpatient clinic for hyperactivity and 60 same-sex normal children. The overall mean phi coefficient for interval agreement was .76, indicating adequate interobserver reliability. Ss referred for hyperactivity had significantly higher scores than comparison Ss on 12 categories. There was greater within-S variability in the hyperactive group. Motor activity for both groups was significantly inversely related to age. The behavior frequencies during initial and later observations were not significantly different, indicating a lack of systematic observer effects on the S's behavior. However, there was overlap between the hyperactive and comparison Ss for all observation categories. Poor discrimination between the groups was therefore obtained with single-category criteria. Two-category criteria, especially the dyad interference and off task, substantially increased the code's discriminability, resulting in relatively few false positive and few false negative classifications. The code is felt to be a reliable and valid instrument for the objective quantification of classroom behavior in hyperactive children.

Abstract = {Estimated the selection errors which would result from the use of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) to select Black and Mexican-American college students. By using the regressions of college GPA on high school GPA and HSGPA plus SAT scores, it was possible to project accept-reject/succeed-fail matrices for Black and Mexican-American students at 4 large universities. Overall, these groups scored considerably lower on the SAT than on either HSGPA or GPA. The addition of SAT only slightly improved the validity of HSGPA as a predictor of college GPA. Thus, the use of the SAT produced only minimal improvements in selection accuracy. However, these minimal improvements were achieved by decreasing false-positive selection errors while increasing false-negative ones. The net result was the admissibility of fewer minority students. The necessity of evaluating the costs of the different selection outcomes is discussed along with a possible explanation for weak GPA prediction. The problem of restriction of range as a factor in the attenuation of SAT validity is also considered. (16 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

As predicted, when the same scale was used in another culture (i.e., the US) on 37 normals and 16 neurotics, there was a greater number of false positives and false negatives with an overall misclassification rate of 24.5%, although it could still discriminate normals from neurotics at .01 level of significance.

Teachers made similar ratings of peer-acceptance and completed the School Behavior Checklist for 35 of 99 children identified as rejected by sociometric nomination criteria. Results from peer–teacher rating comparisons indicate that while significant overlap was found, substantial differences (both false negatives and false positives) emerged. An examination of populations selected and not selected by teachers revealed that teachers were generally successful in identifying those who experienced the most severe peer rejection and that they were most likely to select children exhibiting academic difficulties as suffering from low peer status.

Abstract = {Suggests that the 9-nation methodology of the World Health Organization's International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia provides an opportunity for scientific assessment of established diagnostic schools. To illustrate the value of a multination design, data analyses previously done in evaluating the diagnostic approaches of K. Schneider (1959) and G. Langfeldt (1937, 1969) are summarized. A rationale for using cross-cultural research methodologies in the study of highly discriminating signs and symptoms in schizophrenia is also presented. A test of the system, which includes 12 signs and symptoms, is reported. The system appears to be particularly reliable, since it is operationalized by a few questions that a psychiatrist can be taught to score reliably from a single psychiatric interview. It can be applied at various levels of diagnostic stringency and in each case provides an estimate of false negative and false positive diagnostic assignments.

Abstract = {Examined the relationship of late-life depression to memory complaint and objective performance in a recognition memory task. 57 individuals (aged 58–88 yrs) were evaluated for depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (short form). Ss were shown 2 stimulus lists, each consisting of high-imagery and low-imagery words, and recognition for these words was tested. Error rates and nonparametric signal detection measures were analyzed as indices of performance. Ss gave global self-assessment of memory and, during the recognition task, also made self-ratings of performance. Depressed Ss showed more conservative response biases than nondepressed Ss, reflected in a higher false-negative error rate but a lower false-positive rate. Neither overall memory sensitivity, as assessed by signal detection analysis, nor self-ratings of performance were related to depression, though global memory self-ratings were. Elderly depressed Ss presented a pattern of greater memory complaint and unwillingness to venture responses in spite of showing small or no information-processing deficits.

The GHQ proved to be a valid instrument for the routine screening of this population. The presence of organic anginal pain was associated with high scores on the GHQ, but with a lower specificity and a higher percentage of false positives. This was not found in Ss with atypical or noncardiac chest pain. These findings suggest a need for an upward revision of the cutoff score on the GHQ in patients with organic anginal pain. False negatives were found predominantly among Ss with personality disorders and in those characterized by the long-standing nature of their symptomatology and by higher levels of defensiveness.

Group 1 (27 soldiers [mean age 21 yrs]) and Group 3 (25 forensic patients [mean age 29 yrs] with head injuries, tumors, or suspected organic impairment) were instructed to complete the SPM to the best of their ability; Group 2 (16 Army psychiatric nursing students and 13 bomb disposal experts [mean age 24 yrs]) was asked to fake below their genuine ability and then to perform as well as they could. Results show that faking significantly reduced the rate of decay across the 5 sets of problems, as measured by a statistical method suggested by G. W. Snedecor and W. G. Cochran (1967). This method was found to be effective in discriminating between genuine and faked impairment and proved superior to the discrepancy method recommended by J. C. Raven (1960), the SPM developer. Cut-off scores are provided to enable the clinician to apply this method to individual cases and to minimize false positive and false negative scores.

Abstract = {Developed a 62-item forced-choice questionnaire to measure schizophrenia without yielding significant numbers of false positives and false negatives. Data from 83 schizophrenics (mean age 33.4 yrs) indicate that manipulation of difference limens for recognition of pathology between paired attitudinal statements allowed more accurate assessment of test defensiveness than true–false techniques used with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Schizophrenics whose symptoms were either in remission or obscured by defensiveness were identified even when MMPI scale-8 T scores were less than 70.

Abstract = {Examined the effects of a single-session masturbation seminar on the beliefs, guilt, and behavior of 198 high school males (average age 15 yrs) with regard to masturbation. Ss were divided into 5 treatment and 4 control groups, each containing an average of 22 Ss. It was predicted that the treatment group, as compared to the control group, would be more positive in their attitudes toward masturbation in general, have fewer false beliefs about the harmful nature of masturbation (sex myths), have less sex guilt associated with masturbating, and report a greater frequency of masturbation. Results indicate that, for the treatment group, attitudes were more positive toward masturbation in general, and there were fewer false beliefs. Negative feelings (e.g., guilt) were not influenced following instruction, nor was masturbatory behavior. Findings provide support for a multivariate construct approach to studying masturbation attitudes and behavior and also offer some support for the inclusion of seminars about adolescent masturbation in similar sex-education programs.

Abstract = {Decision implications of E. K. Strong's (1955) assumption of equal base rates for his men-in-general and individual occupational groups are explored, using the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) Physician's scale as an example. It is demonstrated that when realistic base rates are assumed, total decision error rate using the SVIB-even when optimal cutting scores are employed-is at best about equal to that resulting from prediction using base rates alone. Use of the SVIB as recommended by Strong implicitly assumes that false negative errors are much more serious than are false positives. When "reasonable" utility or gain matrices are assumed, use of the SVIB can reduce total error rate despite the limitations imposed by low occupational base rates; this effect is greater when statistically optimal cutting scores, rather than those recommended by Strong, are used.

Abstract = {Used 2 conditions of familiarity of material and 2 conditions of payoff in a short-term memory scanning task with 20 paid undergraduates. Memory sets and probes were either drawn from a small, well-learned pool of words (the familiar set) or were sampled without replacement from a very large pool of words (the infinite set). Under both payoffs the infinite memory sets were searched at a faster rate than the familiar sets. The speed payoff reduced the constant component of latencies and, contrary to previous findings, increased the rate of memory search for both sets. Errors increased from about 1% with accuracy payoff to 19% with speed payoff. Under speed payoff most of the errors were false positives for the familiar set and false negatives for the infinite set. Several models of the task are considered, but none prove entirely satisfactory. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

With otpimum cutoff scores it was possible to indicate the presence of laterality or diffuseness of brain damage in 70% of the cases. Brain damage without regard to lateralization was correctly determined in 90% of cases with 7.5% false negatives and 2.5% false positive. The test was then cross-validated on 65 consecutive admissions with small loss in predictive efficiency. The data support the use of sensorimotor rather than perceptual cognitive tests in screening for brain damage because they are less dependent upon educational background and because of the lateralizing significance of sensorimotor dysfunction.

An efficiency index based solely upon the expected proportion of correct classifications might well lead to an incorrect decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of a given test. A relatively simple formula is presented, taking into account error costs, as well as the discriminatory power of the instrument, and the population base rate. The formula is then applied to certain hypothetical examples, showing how a decision may be reversed when information regarding error costs is introduced.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, The Psychology of Sex Differences by Eleanor Emmons Maccoby and Carol Nagy Jacklin (see record [rid]1975-09417-000[/rid]). This book is an encylopedic review of the nonmedical, social, and psychological research literature on sex differences during 1966-1973. The authors draw cautious attention to the methodological pitfalls of false positives and false negatives, of differences of statistical significance but trivial magnitude, of failing to report or publish negative findings, and of the danger that an isolated positive finding will be magnified out of all proportion if it becomes fashionable to quote it. The authors' overall approach is descriptive and phenomenological, as is the approach of the majority of authors they are reviewing. In a sense, therefore, researchers are flogging the dead horse of how the sexes today are different, whereas what everyone wants to know is why they are different, and whether the differences are immutable or not. The author's deal with these matters of sex roles and sex-coded roles, their present book is the one you need. There is no other compendium of the status quo of research into sex differences that will serve you so well.

Abstract = {Reports 2 experiments on the effect of negation on reasoning with conditional rules. In Exp. 1 with 16 undergraduates, significantly more affirmative than negative statements were denied by a valid inference (modus tollens), and significantly more negative than affirmative statements were affirmed by a fallacious inference (affirmation of the consequent). Ss made their inferences by choosing from a list of possible conclusions, so that, for example, an affirmative statement, "p," could be denied by selecting the negative conclusions, "not p." It is hypothesized that the greater difficulty experienced by Ss in the denial of "not p" by a choice of "p" might be due to the additional intermediate step of double negation, i.e., "not not p," which is involved. Results of Exp. II (with 16 postgraduate education students) suggest, however, that the difficulty lies in Ss' inability to infer that a negative statement is false rather than in the process of transforming a double negative into an affirmative.

Abstract = {Argues that difficulty in processing negatives is a question of a complex of issues concerning the material to be processed, e.g., ambiguity, confusability, and context. Ss were 60 undergraduates. Results are presented indicating that a decrease in confusability facilitates the processing of true negative and false affirmative statements; these results are consistent with predictions arising from the general argument. Results of previous studies are then reconsidered and preliminary conclusions adduced. (30 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Articles by the 2nd author and S. Nielsen (see PA, Vols 67:1443 and 69:12939) and J. Nevid (see record [rid]1983-11675-001[/rid]) have examined and debated the clinical significance of the negative relationship between the Hopelessness Scale and the social desirability (SD) response style. K. Petrie and K. Chamberlain (see record [rid]1983-32939-001[/rid]) found that the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale had no influence on the prediction of suicidal behavior. The present authors argue that this study did not address the question of SD response set in self-reported hopelessness, as the Marlowe-Crowne scale is factorially distinct from existing SD scales. The clinical utility of including SD assessment in the risk assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior was analyzed using both a general population sample (n = 197) of Ss in a previous study by the 2nd author and Nielsen (1981) and a psychiatric sample (n = 96) who participated in a study by the 2nd author et al (1983). Results indicate that prediction accuracy was enhanced by including SD assessment, particularly among psychiatric patients and when historical reports of suicidal behavior were involved. Nevertheless, using only hopelessness, depression, and SD assessments in suicide risk prediction still produced a dangerously high level of false negative cases in both general population and psychiatric samples.

Abstract = {31 Japanese-speaking 4–5 yr olds were given a verification and a question-answering task. In the verification task, Ss were asked to verify 40 statements consisting of true affirmatives, true negatives, and false negatives. In the question-answering task, Ss answered 40 corresponding questions. Ss' gestural and verbal responses were scored as correct if they gave an expected response; all other responses were scored as incorrect. All Ss performed better on the verification than on the question-answering task, supporting the verification primary hypothesis. Ss also scored better on affirmatives than on negatives. Differences between the performances of 4- and 5-yr-olds are discussed, and overall results are contrasted with data obtained from English-speaking children.

Abstract = {32 8–9 and 10–11 yr olds were asked to perform 2 statement verification tasks. Task 1 consisted of statements that were likely to elicit an affirmative knowledge representation, "You have three eyes," which is likely to elicit the representation, "I have two eyes." Task 2 consisted of statements that were likely to elicit a negative knowledge of representation, "You have a tail," which is likely to elicit a negative representation, "I do not have a tail." All statements varied in 2 dimensions, polarity (affirmative vs negative), and truth value (true vs false). Negative statements in Task 1 were found to be more difficult for Ss to verify than those in Task 2. This performance difference was used to infer the form of knowledge representation generated in verifying negative statements. (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Proposed that in some situations depressives may be more willing, but not more able, to report remembering negative self-relevant information. 15 depressed, 33 formerly depressed, and 24 nondepressed female college students were given recall and recognition tests for positive and negative adjectives that they had previously selected as being self-descriptive. Three recall tests were administered: after 1 hr, after 2 days, and after 1 wk. Depressed Ss recalled correctly more negative adjectives, produced more negative intrusions in recall, and produced more negative false alarms in recognition. However, a signal detection analysis revealed that depressives' memories, as indexed by d′, were not superior to the other groups'; rather, they employed a more liberal criterion in making recognition judgments. The hypothesis that depressives show a response bias favoring the report of negative self-relevant information was confirmed and can account for both the recall and recognition results.

Abstract = {By means of a hypnotic mood-induction procedure, 54 undergraduates were made to experience a happy, sad, or neutral state. Temporary depression caused decreased recall of positive life experiences, weaker memory strength for positive information about oneself, and a bias to recall false negative self-descriptions. Induced elation was associated with decreased recall of negative events and an increased recall of positive events. Results support A. T. Beck's (1967, 1976) notion that mood states are associated with distorted information processing about the self. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Larry L. Constantine (see record [rid]2013-42256-029[/rid]) on the original article by (see record [rid]2013-42233-009[/rid]). The concern here appears to be that mandatory reporting requirements in the context of “family treatment” are problematic since they fail to treat the child as a party to treatment and further, that reporting requirements might "bias' the therapists through the labeling of one person as perpetrator. The questions as to constitutional rights raised here are substantial ones. Child abuse neglect statutes deal with situations in which rights of children, parents, and the state are in conflict. Enacted statutes represent a particular societal trade-off among these competing interests. The risk of increased "false positives" resulting from laws which encourage over-reporting must be weighted against the harm to children arising out of "false negatives". Mr. Constantine’s belief that affording anonymity to those who report, and requiring a showing of the reporter’s malicious intent, rather than, say, his reckless negligence, in seeking redress for a false report draws the line too far from the constititional rights of those reported.

Studied the development of the concept of truth-functional negation in 2 experiments, using 36 English-speaking children (aged 3-6 yrs) and 10 Korean-speaking children (aged 4-5 yrs) as Ss. In Exp I, English-speaking Ss were given a sentence-variation task in which the following 4 sentence types were used to describe 36 pictures of common items: true affirmative, false affirmative, true negative (TN), and false negative. The results show that a majority of Ss under 5 yrs had difficulty with negative sentences, particularly TN sentences, indicating a lack of explicit understanding of truth-functional negation as defined in logic. In Exp II, a cross-linguistic replication of Exp I was attempted with Korean-speaking Ss. Despite some cross-linguistic differences in the negation system, the Korean-speaking Ss showed essentially the same pattern of results, suggesting that the development in question proceeds within the general limit set by the general cognitive development.

Male rats were trained to discriminate nicotine (NIC), midazolam (MDZ), or the combination of these drugs from saline (n = 10). Ss were trained to 95% accuracy in a 2-bar operant procedure with a tandem schedule of food reinforcement. NIC was a more salient component (85% drug-appropriate responding) than was MDZ (47%) in the compound stimulus. Ss were then tested with benzodiazepine and NIC antagonists flumazenil and mecamylamine alone or in combination. Flumazenil alone had no effect whereas mecamylamine alone produced a significant but incomplete block, explainable by the greater salience of the NIC cue component. The antagonists in combination produced greater blockade than did mecamylamine on its own. Results suggest that "false negative" results in drug discrimination experiments may be obtained with antagonists when a training drug produces a stimulus with more than 1 component.

The scale was highly internally consistent and, although a clean factor structure emerged, basically unidimensional. Test-retest reliability at 1 mo was good, but correlations with staff-rated depression were only moderate. GDS-based classifications of respondents as suffering possible major, minor, or no depression were fairly consistent with those based on a symptom checklist and with clinical diagnoses. However, both the GDS and the checklist yielded high false negative rates vis à vis clinically diagnosed minor depression. There were no differences in reliability or validity for cognitively impaired and intact groups. GDS responses did not vary with age or length of institutionalization, but there was a positive correlation with functional disability and ill health.

Abstract = {Tested the hypothesis that acute schizophrenics are more likely to show affective symptomatology than chronic schizophrenics. The Personal Illness (PI) and Personal Disturbance (PD) scales of the Symptom-Sign Inventory were administered to 50 schizophrenic inpatients. On the PI Scale 56% of acute schizophrenics and 28% of chronic schizophrenics obtained pathological scores. On the PD Scale, depending on the cut-off point selected, 64-88% of acutes, and 28-56% of chronics obtained pathological scores. In the case of acute schizophrenia it is considered confirmed that a high percentage of patients obtain pathological scores on the PI Scale, indicating the presence of prima facie anxiety and depressive symptoms. Relatively high numbers of chronic Ss also obtained elevated scores, but it is argued that this does not exclude the possibility of affective blunting or flattening. The PD scores showed high correlations with the PI scores, not altogether due to their having certain questions in common. The PD Scale showed fewer false negatives than the PI Scale on this schizophrenic population, and discriminated more sharply between the acute and chronic. It is concluded that although affective symptoms are more common in acute than in chronic schizophrenics, an appreciable proportion of the latter do have them, and in this sense may be said to suffer from their illness.

Abstract = {The michigan alcoholism screening test (mast), devised to provide a consistent, quantifiable, structured interview instrument to detect alcoholism, consists of 25 questions that can be rapidly administered. 5 groups were given the mast: hospitalized alcoholics, a control group, persons convicted of drunk driving, persons convicted of drunk and disorderly behavior, and drivers whose licenses were under review. The validity of the mast was assessed by searching the records of legal, social, and medical agencies and reviewing the ss' driving and criminal records. The mast responses of 15 ss who were found to be alcoholic in the record search were analyzed to determine where the screening failures had occurred. Recommendations are made for reducing the number of such "false negatives." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {2nd study in a series investigating speed and reliability of performance by pairs of human operators as a function of operator redundancy and task difficulty. 8 pairs of Ss responded under 8 combinations of redundancy (redundant-nonredundant), stimulus complexity (4 or 8 critical stimuli), and critical time duration (1 or 2 sec.)) The stimuli consisted of pairs of lights in a 4 X 3 matrix. 12 critical stimuli were employed under each condition, and these were randomly placed in a set of 60 stimuli. Results were analyzed with respect to reaction time and positive (false response) and negative (missed critical stimulus) errors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The Boder Test of Reading-Spelling Patterns (BTRSP) purports to classify underachieving readers into categories of nonspecific reading retardation or 1 of 3 dyslexia subtypes that indicate problems in processing phonics and analytic-sequential stimuli (dysphonetic), problems learning sight words and in processing simultaneous gestalt stimuli (dyseidetic), or mixed processing difficulties. This study compared the performance of 13 dysphonetic, 9 nonspecific, and 10 normal readers (mean age 9 yrs 2 mo) on gestalt tasks of facial memory, tactile-visual recognition, Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices, and Benton Visual Retention Test. Ss' performance was also assessed on analytic-sequential tasks of auditory sequential memory, visual sequential memory, sound blending, and the Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization Test. The construct validity of the dysphonetic and nonspecific categories received support; however, a large proportion of cases consisting of classification error (false negatives) was suspected. The BTRSP classification criteria of reading level, spelling level, and application of phonics are judged useful dimensions in distinguishing 2 subtypes of disabled readers and reflective of other cognitive abilities.

Abstract = {Two matched groups of 6 male and 6 female 18–30 yr old adults and 6 male and 6 female 65–70 yr old adults were compared on 2 information-processing (rotated-figures and sentence verification) tasks. In the rotated figures task, Ss had to decide whether a figure displayed upright or inverted, faced forwards or backwards, held a ball in its right or left hand. In the sentence verification task, Ss had to decide whether an affirmative or negative sentence was true or false as a description of a pattern. From RT patterns and from Ss' verbal reports, it was possible to identify the strategies Ss used on each task. Results show that the number of Ss selecting each different strategy was similar for old and young groups, but age differences were greater with some strategies than with others. The age difference was minimized when older Ss adopted strategies that reduced the amount of processing demands. Older Ss, however, were more disadvantaged when employing strategies that imposed greater processing demands or a heavy memory load.

Abstract = {In 2 experiments with 96 college and high school students, interindividual communication of forms in intramodal (visual–visual, tactual–tactual) and cross-modal (visual–tactual, tactual–visual) conditions were compared with the corresponding conditions in intraindividual matching. In Exp I, speakers verbally described 3-dimensional objects to listeners, who, on the basis of these descriptions, judged the stimuli presented in the other modality to be same or different. The descriptions produced were transcribed and used again in Exp II. In this experiment, listeners judged stimuli on the basis of descriptions originally meant for comparisons in a different modality. In both experiments, the communication phase was followed by individual matching. Results are interpreted as showing that verbal communication efficiently reflected the performance in intraindividual matching. Intramodal descriptions were less useful than cross-modal descriptions in a modality other than the one in which the descriptions were produced. Contrary to earlier findings, there was no indication of false negative errors being associated with verbalization. The verbal–perceptual parallellism suggested by these results is discussed.

Abstract = {Nonverbal visual memory together with speed and bias in response decisions were evaluated in 2 experiments comparing patients with left and right-hemisphere stroke lesions. In Exp I with 22 left- and 15 right-lateralized brain damaged Ss (average age 60 yrs), decision times of vocal recognition responses from aphasic (left stroke) Ss did not correlate with verbal scores on the Porch Index of Communicative Ability, taken as an estimate of severity of their language impairment. Thus, impairment of verbal processing was not reflected in speed of response. In Exp II, 19 left- and 19 right-stroke patients (average age 60 yrs) were compared with 19 volunteers on a recurrent recognition task of complex nonverbal art designs, using measures of discriminability and decision bias derived from theory of signal detection. Right-stroke Ss had lowest recognition scores but adopted normal decision criteria; left-stroke Ss employed high negative decision bias (i.e., made few false and few correct recognitions). Both groups responded significantly slower than controls; the right-stroke Ss, however, had markedly fewer long-latency decisions than left-stroke Ss. Compared with controls, only the speed and bias of decision making were deficient in left-stroke Ss independent of their verbal deficit; their recognition ability was relatively preserved.

Abstract = {75 2nd and 4th graders were given 2 tasks—a semistructured friendship expectation (FE) interview and a picture sequence task—to determine their developmental FE levels. A modification of the Picture Arrangement (PA) subtest of the WISC-R and 9 FE picture sequences, corresponding to an extant 8-level developmental sequence, were also administered. FE levels based on the interview task were marginally more advanced for both grades. Interview FEs showed no significant relationship to age, whereas picture sequence FEs did. This difference was due to the Type II errors on the visual task at Grade 2 and the interview task at Grade 4. Picture sequencing was unrelated to PA or to task difficulty. The visual task was an apparent underestimate of FE level for 65 Ss who scored ≤ FE Level 2 on the visual task. However, sole use of the interview created a large underestimate for 10/11 Ss who scored > FE Level 2 on the visual index. The risk of underestimation was eliminated by additional use of the visual index, and the more advanced the performance on the visual task, the higher the risk of false negative errors on the interview.

Abstract = {Tested whether or not a self-report measure of broad or narrow attentional style (the Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style) could predict cue-processing ability on a task that required processing of peripheral cues. In Exp I (78 undergraduates), it was hypothesized that broad attenders would be superior to narrow attenders. Two separate probe techniques were used to measure peripheral cue processing. Results indicate marginal support for the prediction on the 1st probe and strong support on the 2nd probe. In Exp II, Ss received either positive or negative false feedback in an attempt to manipulate level of anxiety and to observe the subsequent effects on the cue-processing ability of broad and narrow attenders. Broad attenders who received positive feedback processed peripheral cues faster than other Ss. Findings are discussed within the framework of the capacity theory of attention (D. Kahneman, 1973) and the desirability of employing a precise operational definition of attention within individual difference research.

Each S was examined with the neuropsychologic screening battery, and data were analyzed by a stepwise linear discriminant function program. Statistical classifications were compared with criteria for NBD vs SBD + DBD and for SBD vs DBD groupings. Hit rates ranged from 95% for the former to 81.7% for the latter, with low false positives and negatives. Hit and miss rates were not as strong in a validation step, but exceeded chance levels.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by P. McGuffin et al (see record [rid]1981-32982-001[/rid]) about their search for a common etiological factor—namely, gluten—in schizophrenia and celiac disease; most untreated celiacs show elevated titers of gluten antibodies. The authors found no significant difference between titers of sera from 31 schizophrenics and 30 controls, but pointed out that their small samples make their conclusions subject to Type II (false negative) errors. The present author agrees. Beta, the probability of Type II errors, can be determined for specific sample sizes, and the McGuffin et al samples should have been half again as large to have had even 50% probability of detecting a significant difference between their schizophrenics and controls. Other work is cited suggesting that gluten antibodies in sera of schizophrenics and other psychiatric disorders are not of primary pathogenic significance. The hypothesis that schizophrenia and celiac disease share one or more genes, but not all, is discussed in terms of the possible mechanisms involved and the research needed—with special attention to beta—to test it.

Their pretreatment descriptions of pain are similar in both intensity and quality to descriptions given by organic patients. Ss identified as functional resembled patients with documented psychological disturbance. Their pain was significantly more variable, diffuse, and intense. Predicted differences in response to treatment also occurred. Ss identified as organic improved more than Ss identified as functional, consistent with the assumption that medical treatment is less relevant in the management of pain associated with psychological disturbance.

Jacobs et al (1977), and a test using a tachistoscope (T-scope) developed by N. E. Pauker et al (see record [rid]1979-05084-001[/rid]). Ss were 97 medical-surgical inpatients referred for psychiatric consultation. The CCSE, MMS, and T-scope showed sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. False negatives occurred most often among Ss with mild organic mental disorders. The T-scope could not be administered in 27% of the Ss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a replication of an earlier study by J. A. Berg and G. M. Rapaport (see record [rid]1955-05690-001[/rid]), a questionnaire with items lacking content and containing merely answer possibilities was administered to 197 Dutch psychology freshmen. Ss clearly did not react in accordance with the laws of statistical probability but showed, like Berg and Rapaport's Ss, a preference for positive options such as yes, true, and satisfied over negative options such as no, false, and dissatisfied. No sex differences or differences due to position of the answer possibilities were found. This result is in contrast with the 1954 findings, because Berg and Rapaport found that option position and Ss' sex did influence response bias.

Abstract = {The ability of the Minnesota Child Development Inventory (MCDI) to identify developmental strengths and weaknesses was investigated with 60 nursery school children and 62 Head Start children. As expected, the MCDI identified more problems in the high risk Head Start group and, for 5 of the 8 developmental areas, significantly predicted subsequent Head Start teacher evaluations of each child. Modifying the MCDI cutoff score reduced substantially the false negatives. Thus, the MCDI shows promise as a useful developmental screening instrument for lower socioeconomic, preschool age children. Implications for remedial planning are addressed. (8 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three convenient measures of senile confusion are informal staff ratings, the Face-Hand Test (FHT), and the Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ). 112 geriatric patients in 2 extended care facilities and 40 community aged were examined by means of the FHT and MSQ. These instruments proved valuable in differentiating patients rated as confused from those rated as lucid and alert and from the community Ss. However, each of these measures, as well the staff ratings, produced false negative findings. Staff ratings incorrectly identified a hypochondriacal and paranoid patient as confused. The FHT scores of lucid and alert patients with some brain damage were low. MSQ scores of some poorly educated immigrants were very low, even though these patients were rated as lucid and alert by the staff and passed the FHT. One normally lucid and alert patient with a fever and an irregular rapid pulse failed both the FHT and the MSQ. Guidelines for further use of these instruments are presented.

Abstract = {Comparisons of estimated global intelligence, from knowledge of occupation and completed years of education, with obtained IQ scores have been widely used clinically as signs of intellectual deterioration associated with cerebral impairment. However, these signs have not been evaluated empirically. Individual measures of deterioration from education and occupation were codified by 2 student raters and were used alone and with other intelligence test scores as predictor variables in 2 linear stepwise discriminant functions. Cross-validated predictive outcomes from both functions were comparably high (75–83% correct classification), thus validating these signs as useful measures of intellectual deterioration. Clinically, the discriminant function calculated on the 2 codified signs should be used in conjunction with psychometric and historical data to minimize false negative errors.

Ss were 598 patients undergoing neuropsychological testing. For the TMT, highly significant differences in mean scores were seen when preselected neurologic patients and patients without neurologic stigmata were compared. Similarly, the distribution of classification of these patients by the BBIP was significantly different from chance. Application of these measures in a screening paradigm, however, yielded large numbers of false negatives against both neurological and psychological criteria. It was not possible to establish an optimal cutting score to justify application of these measures as screening devices, either alone or in concert.

Results show no significant differences in number of errors as a function of any of the conditions. The pattern of reaction times corresponded exactly to that predicted by the type of instructions, including the reaction times to expletive sentences, which extends the range of syntactic structures to which the models apply.

Abstract = {Measured the nonverbal reasoning performance of 410 advantaged and 552 disadvantaged Israeli 2nd, 4th, and 6th graders. Measurement followed the Learning Potential (LP) paradigm, with its 3 stages: pretesting, coaching in relevant problem-solving strategies, and posttesting. The Series Learning Potential Test and a substitution (Coding) test were used. All results are presented in raw scores in an attempt to assess absolute performance levels and to present differences in terms of time gaps. Results show that all groups benefited substantially from training, but the improvement following training tended to decrease in the higher grades. In all grade levels, disadvantaged Ss benefited from the coaching more than advantaged. The performance time gap between advantaged and disadvantaged Ss was about 2 yrs, with a tendency to grow with increasing age. The contribution of the coaching session in terms of absolute performance was equivalent to about 2 yrs. Posttest distributions of raw scores revealed a growing tendency toward unimodality and decreased proportions of false negatives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Two cohorts of approximately 850 middle-class kindergarten children were administered a psychometric battery (e.g., the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test). Also, a Student Rating Scale consisting of 41 classroom behavior items representing 5 factors was completed for each S by the kindergarten teacher. The scale proved equal to the best psychometric measures in predicting reading test scores in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grades. Inclusion of classroom and school variables enhanced the prediction. Particularly instructive were analyses of false positive and negative prediction patterns. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Decision-theoretic criteria are presented for optimizing the information gathered from a series of psychiatric interviews over time. It is shown that the optimum interviewing strategy depends strongly on assumptions about the covariation of behavior over time. An interviewing strategy based on dynamic programming is presented that provides optimal information return from a series of interviews under assumptions that are realistic for mental health applications. A system using this approach can tailor its interviewing strategy to adapt to differences in interview content, item importance, and individual response patterns, selecting the optimally informative questions to ask each S at each point in time. Simulation results show that this approach achieves a 34% reduction in the false negatives obtained with the major-problem/target-complaints method, and, depending on the acceptable error rate, a reduction of 47% or more in the questions that are needed in standard interviewing.

Abstract = {Assessed the effects of sleep loss and long-term physical exercise on the ability to process complex information in a series of 7 sustained operations studies involving 100 Marine Corps enlistees (mean age 21.2 yrs). The percent correct answers to the 8 logical reasoning sentence types involving different voice (active vs passive), use of negatives, and outcome (true vs false) were analyzed over 3 days across 3 levels of exercise and rest conditions. Analyses showed a higher percent correct for the actively worded than for the passively worded sentences. The sleep loss over the 2 continuous workdays resulted in a significant decrease in percent correct for the statements with active wording. The sleep loss effects on comprehension seemed due to a lessening of the attention given to those more simple sentences in active voice, whereas increased arousal may have been elicited by the more complex sentences in passive voice. It is suggested that the increased attention to the passive statements may have overcome the effects of sleep loss. It is concluded that results show the usefulness of analyzing responses to the logical reasoning test by sentence complexity for indicating selective cognitive changes in the processing of information.

Abstract = {In 57 patients (25 men and 32 women) under 50 who were hospitalized for schizophrenia for the 1st time between 1945 and 1959, the maximum transverse diameter of the 3rd ventricle was measured by echoencephalography after an average of 16.3 yrs' illness and compared with the type of psychopathologic remission. The arithmetic mean of the values measured and the empiric range of measurement were significantly higher and wider in the 39 Ss in whom remission took the form of a residual syndrome including the "pure defect" (reiner Defekt) than in 18 Ss in whom remission was complete. The pathologic echo value in the group with residual syndromes, at 51.3%, was considerably higher than that in the group in whom remission was complete (22.2%). In 19 Ss with residual syndromes (48.7%) the echo findings were not unequivocally pathologic, but borderline values for the 3rd ventricle were observed in 12 Ss in this subgroup, which may be pseudonormal (false-negative) findings due to constitutionally small ventricular systems. Different interpretations of the echoencephalographic changes, which are regarded as a correlate of the pure reduction of potential, are discussed.

Abstract = {Readiness is a concept which has been simplified and overworked in efforts to explain away school adjustment problems of certain children. Readiness does not necessarily come with age of eagerness, but may depend upon what happens to the child in the school which affects the needs of the child for feelings of security, understanding, and sympathy. Lack of maturation may partly account for lack of readiness, but other factors may be adversely affected by passing of time; these may include lack of stimulating environment in the home, which removes incentive, and certain remediable and alterable details such as negative attitudes, false conceptions about school, poor eyesight and hearing loss, and other such factors. To carry out a prevention program the cleavage between home and school must be closed during the pre-school period, by promoting understanding and cooperation of the parents.

Abstract = {The present experiment was designed both to study the efficiency of some standard MMPI profile signs in differentiating between psychotic and non-psychotic adults, male psychiatric patients, and to investigate the degree to which the new K correction improves the performance of the test in this regard. It is concluded that (1) blind MMPI profile diagnosis based on the signs employed in this study does not appear to be satisfactory; (2) the K correction failed to improve significantly the accuracy of these diagnostic signs; (3) the K correction failed to reduce significantly the frequency of "false negative" profiles.

Abstract = {One hundred fifty hospital employees and 100 patients took the Harrower-Erickson Multiple Choice Test. Answers were scored using (1) the number of first choice abnormal plus alternate responses, (2) the number of first choice abnormal plus abnormal alternate responses, and (3) the total weighted scores for first and second choices, giving abnormal alternates a weight of 1, divided by the total number of responses. These methods classed from 61 to 69% of the patients and 23 to 39% of the employees as abnormal; 16 to 17% of 77 student nurses given the test obtained scores of 4 or more abnormal responses. As various other scoring procedures failed to decrease appreciably the number of false positives and negatives, it is concluded that these are probably due to imperfections in the test itself.

Abstract = {From the data obtained in the Scottish Survey on performance tests, it appeared that a speed factor might be operative in some of the tests. Further examination and intercorrelation of these data showed that the Cube Construction test data gave no evidence of any correlation between time and scores, thus holding an intermediate position between the Manikin test (r = + .3) and the Kohs test (r = - .8). It seems possible that a true positive correlation between ability and speed in the Cube Construction test is exactly balanced by a false negative one. There may be 2 influences making for short time. One influence makes one child soon get the correct, or at least a good, result; the other makes another child soon satisfied with any result, even a bad one. Thus "times can only be useful data if they are all times for performing correctly, or at least nearly correctly, the task set. Times for performing a task with varying degrees of correctness spread over a wide range seem to be a complex variate of little use in practice."

Abstract = {Author's reply to the comment made by Karno et al (see record [rid]2005-09718-003[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]1984-08451-001[/rid]). Karno et al call attention to many reasons why the DIS/lay interviewer approach may produce false-negative assessment of lifetime psychotic features, but then complain that we conclude that the DIS/lay interviewer approach underestimates the lifetime occurrence of psychotic symptoms and diagnoses. They are correct that we reported the DIS failed to detect previously elicited psychotic symptom. Those who believe our concern is valid, as Karno et al apparently do, will surely welcome data bearing on the extent, circumstances, and solutions to this issue. We think that Karno et al are incorrect in stating that we suggested "that the sensitivity levels reported for the DIS in this study reflect inadequacies of the lay interview relative to the clinician interview or inadequacies of highly structured versus more subjective methods of eliciting and evaluating behavior".

One group of Ss received biofeedback training directly prior to exposure to an experimentally produced LH situation. A 2nd group also received biofeedback training but were given false/negative feedback about their performance. A 3rd group received only the LH procedure, and a 4th group served as a no-treatment control. Only in the biofeedback group receiving accurate feedback was there any prevention of the subsequent development of LH behavior. (8 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

It is also suggested that Block's criticisms center on a function not at all envisaged for the scale, that is, the discrimination of psychotics from normals and other nonpsychotic groups. The scale was constructed to measure the underlying personality dimensions of psychoticism in nonclinical groups; therefore, the number of false positives and negatives in comparing normal and psychotic groups is largely irrelevant.

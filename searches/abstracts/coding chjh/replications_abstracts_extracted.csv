1,"Examined whether the association between depression (DEP) and headaches (HAs) was greater among women who matured during periods of a high degree of change in opportunities for achievement compared with women of the previous generation. In Studies 1a and 1b, a replication of a study by D. K. Zeigler et al (1978) found that DEP and HA frequency were significantly related among women born between 1937 and 1951 and those born between 1952 and 1961 (periods of change), whereas HAs and DEP were not significantly related among women born between 1922 and 1936 (a period of stability). In Studies 2a and 2b, self-reported DEP and HA shared significant variance only among 53 of 208 female adolescents (aged 14â€“29 yrs) who reported concerns regarding the limited achievements of their mothers. These females may view the roles of adult women as being limited and may experience stress and low self-esteem associated with depressive and somatic symptomatology.

2,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 24(5) of Neuropsychological Rehabilitation (see record [rid]2014-32552-001[/rid]). In the original article, an incorrect version of Figure 4 was published. The correction has been made to this article.] Developing language treatments that not only improve trained items but also promote generalisation to untrained items is a major focus in aphasia research. This study is a replication and extension of previous work which found that training abstract words in a particular context-category promotes generalisation to concrete words but not vice versa (Kiran, Sandberg, & Abbott, 2009). Twelve persons with aphasia (five female) with varying types and degrees of severity participated in a generative naming treatment based on the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy (CATE; Thompson, Shapiro, Kiran, & Sobecks, 2003). All participants were trained to generate abstract words in a particular context-category by analysing the semantic features of the target words. Two other context-categories were used as controls. Ten of the twelve participants improved on the trained abstract words in the trained context-category. Eight of the ten participants who responded to treatment also generalised to concrete words in the same context-category. These results suggest that this treatment is both efficacious and efficient. We discuss possible mechanisms of training and generalisation effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)",1
3,"Background: Research in adults suggests that intrusive memories are not just found in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet there is little evidence concerning the phenomenology of intrusive memories in children and adolescents. The present study investigated the frequency of intrusive memories following a recent negative event in an adolescent school sample, and considered the application of cognitive theory to understanding the maintenance of intrusive memories of recent negative events, and their role in maintaining depression. Methods: High school students (aged 11â€“18 years; n = 231) completed questionnaires concerning affect experienced during a recent negative event, the frequency of subsequent intrusive memories, memory quality, thought suppression, post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Results: Most participants had experienced at least one intrusive memory in the previous week, at similar rates for traumatic events and life events. In non-trauma exposed youth, peri-event affect and memory quality accounted for unique variance in a regression model of intrusive memory frequency, while peri-event affect, memory quality, and intrusive memory frequency accounted for unique variance in a regression model of depression. Limitations: The study needs replication in younger children. Interview methods may be required to ensure that intrusive memories are being assessed and not intrusive thoughts or ruminations. Conclusions: Intrusive memories are common reaction to negative events in adolescents, and may be involved in maintaining subsequent depressed mood. The nature of event memories may have a role in the maintenance of such psychopathology, and may be a target for psychological interventions in this age group.

4,"The authors investigated whether therapist effects may account for treatment outcomes among pregnant substance users in controlled and naturalistic treatments. Therapists randomized to Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) and treatment as usual (TAU) conditions and assigned at least five clients were included. Client self-reported substance use and urine toxicology at posttreatment, 1- and 3-month follow-ups were obtained. A therapist main effect was found across therapy conditions and within MET (five therapists) but not within TAU (five therapists). When substance use was treated as a dichotomous measure (abstinence/nonabstinence) corroborated with urine toxicology screening, no therapist effect was found. Clients perceived therapists to vary in their supportiveness and listening skills, for example, but these impressions were not associated with therapist effectiveness to reduce substance use. The authors found support for a limited therapist effect, but only within the MET condition and only with a continuous outcome variable. Secondary analyses identified differences in client impressions of their therapist, but these impressions did not predict therapist effectiveness in reducing substance use. Although these findings warrant replication, they suggest that client substance use outcomes among pregnant women may be rather homogeneous regardless of the type of intervention or therapist.

6,"Expertly collected, well-curated data sets consisting of comprehensive clinical characterization and raw structural, functional and diffusion-weighted DICOM images in schizophrenia patients and sex and age-matched controls are now accessible to the scientific community through an on-line data repository (coins.mrn.org). The Mental Illness and Neuroscience Discovery Institute, now the Mind Research Network (MRN, http://www.mrn.org/), comprised of investigators at the University of New Mexico, the University of Minnesota, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Iowa, conducted a cross-sectional study to identify quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers of schizophrenia. Data acquisition across multiple sites permitted the integration and cross-validation of clinical, cognitive, morphometric, and functional neuroimaging results gathered from unique samples of schizophrenia patients and controls using a common protocol across sites. Particular effort was made to recruit patients early in the course of their illness, at the onset of their symptoms. There is a relatively even sampling of illness duration in chronic patients. This data repository will be useful to 1) scientists who can study schizophrenia by further analysis of this cohort and/or by pooling with other data; 2) computer scientists and software algorithm developers for testing and validating novel registration, segmentation, and other analysis software; and 3) educators in the fields of neuroimaging, medical image analysis and medical imaging informatics who need exemplar data sets for courses and workshops. Sharing provides the opportunity for independent replication of already published results from this data set and novel exploration. This manuscript describes the inclusion/exclusion criteria, imaging parameters and other information that will assist those wishing to use this data repository.

7,"Investigated the influence of a low dose of morphine (MOR) on the acquisition and maintenance of consumption of a sweetened ethanol (EtOH) solution. In Exp 1, 25 male rats were injected with either saline (SAL), nothing or MOR and then allowed to drink from 2 bottles, one with EtOH and 1 with plain water for 6 days. The next 6 days Ss were given access to both bottles but no injection. During acquisition in Exp 1, MOR failed to significantly increase the consumption of a sweetened EtOH solution compared to either a postinjection period in the same Ss or a no-treatment control group. Although MOR significantly increased sweetened EtOH consumption when compared to a SAL group, this appears to be due to a stress response to the injections. During maintenance in Exp 2, MOR significantly increased consumption of sweetened EtOH in all groups compared to consumption following SAL control injections. There was no difference in this effect among the 3 groups, suggesting that prior history with MOR was not a factor. In addition, Ss that were exposed to MOR during both experiments drank significantly more sweetened EtOH following injections in Exp 2 than in Exp 1. This study was a replication of studies by C. L. Hubbel et al (1991) and C. W. Hodge et al (1992). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",1

10,"1. From virtually nowhere 20 years ago to sales of US$9.5 billion in 2007, the video game industry has now overtaken movie industry box-office receipts in terms of annual sales, and blockbuster video games can out perform blockbuster movies for opening-week sales. This dramatic growth is likely to continue in coming years. Yet there has been little scholarly attention to consumers within the industry. This research fills this gap by providing a comprehensive study of consumer behaviour in the gaming industry, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB); a widely used, robust and reliable consumer research instrument. The study elicits key salient attributes for the major constructs in the TPB modelâ€”attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural controlâ€”and shows how these key constructs affect purchase intention. To avoid aggregation error in analysing overall market data, this study segments the market and examines differences in perspective by gamer type. We therefore examine differences in these key salient attributes by gamer type to understand consumer motivations better. 2. As the first systematic study to examine consumer behaviour issues in the gaming industry, this study provides useful insights to consumers' behaviour in a large, growing industry. Consumer perceptions and behaviour toward entertainment software is complex and this study is not the final word, but it is the first available empirical evidence and can thus move forward the discussion from speculation to replication, extension, and alternative approaches. For managers in this industry, this study demonstrates how a comprehensive model can be applied to entertainment software. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

12,"BACKGROUND: Various surveys now ask respondents to describe their most recent purchase of illicit drugs, as one mechanism through which market size can be estimated. This raises the question of whether issues surrounding the timing of survey administration might make a sample of most recent purchases differ from a random sample of all purchases. We investigate these issues through a series of questions which ask about the three most recent purchases, and about drug use. METHODS: Data were drawn from 688 respondents in the Melbourne Injecting Drug User Cohort Study across the period 2008â€“2013 and 2782 respondents to the Washington Cannabis Consumption Study in 2013. Responses to questions about the most recent purchases were compared to larger subsets of all recent purchases. RESULTS: For heroin, methamphetamine and cannabis no differences were found between the amount spent by participants on their most recent purchase and the average amount spent on three or more recent purchases. There were also no differences concerning the locations and types of deals, and the duration between consecutive cannabis purchases was the same for first and second most recent, and second and third most recent. CONCLUSIONS: Asking about the most recent purchase appears to be an economical way to learn about purchases more generally, with little evidence of substantial variation between the most recent purchase and other recent purchases reported by participants. In spite of consistent findings across our two surveys, further replication of the work reported in this paper involving other populations of users is warranted.

Results show reduced negative priming was significantly linked with Ss scoring high on scales related to positive aspects of schizophrenic symptomatology, while the Stroop effect was found to be independent of all measures of schizotypy. Negative priming effect between high vs low schizotype groups was evident in male Ss only. The O-LIFE served as a useful tool, allowing examination of specific aspects of schizotypy within the time pressures of a laboratory environment.

15,"Objectives: To determine whether oral language, working memory, and social anxiety differentiate children with selective mutism (SM), children with anxiety disorders (ANX), and normal controls (NCs) and explore predictors of mutism severity. Method: Children ages 6 to 10 years with SM (n = 44) were compared with children with ANX (n = 28) and NCs (n = 19) of similar age on standardized measures of language, nonverbal working memory, and social anxiety. Variables correlating with mutism severity were entered in stepwise regressions to determine predictors of mute behavior in SM. Results: Children with SM scored significantly lower on standardized language measures than children with ANX and NCs and showed greater visual memory deficits and social anxiety relative to these two groups. Age and receptive grammar ability predicted less severe mutism, whereas social anxiety predicted more severe mutism. These factors accounted for 38% of the variance in mutism severity. Conclusions: Social anxiety and language deficits are evident in SM, may predict mutism severity, and should be evaluated in clinical assessment. Replication is indicated, as are further studies of cognition and of intervention in SM, using large, diverse samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

16,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 100(2) of British Journal of Psychology (see record [rid]2009-09703-016[/rid]). In our article, we tested humor as a mediator of bizarreness effects in delayed recall. Ultimately, we concluded that the facilitative effects of bizarreness were mediated by humor. However, because the results indicated that an interaction between bizarreness and humor accounted for the changes in recall, the correct interpretation of the results is that humor serves to moderate the effects of bizarreness. Despite our use of incorrect terminology, the point made in our discussion of the relationship between bizarreness and humor remains unchanged: the facilitative effects of bizarreness on recall depend on humor being induced by bizarreness. That is, bizarre information that is humorous will be recalled well, but recall will not be enhanced by bizarreness if it is not humorous. We thank Rory Allen for pointing out the correct distinction between mediation and moderation.] The first empirical study focused exclusively on the influence of bizarre elaboration on memory (Delin, 1968) indicated a significant relationship between bizarreness and recall after a 15-week delay. However, that study was strongly criticized on methodological grounds. The present study offers a conceptual replication of Delinâ€™s historically significant study which sought to verify his influential, yet criticized, results and to test the possibility that a humor response mediates the relationship between bizarre elaboration and recall using multiple regression procedures. In keeping with Delinâ€™s findings, the results of the present study suggest that bizarre elaboration facilitates both free and cued recall after a substantial delay. The results also suggest that the facilitative effects of bizarreness are mediated by humor. The findings are discussed in the context of a comprehensive theory of bizarreness effects.

18,"Dopamine D2 receptors mediate the rewarding effects of many drugs of abuse. In humans, several polymorphisms in DRD2, the gene encoding these receptors, increase our genetic risk for developing addictive disorders. Here, we examined one of the most frequently studied candidate variant for addiction in DRD2 for association with brain structure. We tested whether this variant showed associations with regional brain volumes across two independent elderly cohorts, totaling 1,032 subjects. We first examined a large sample of 738 elderly participants with neuroimaging and genetic data from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1). We hypothesized that this addiction-related polymorphism would be associated with structural brain differences in regions previously implicated in familial vulnerability for drug dependence. Then, we assessed the generalizability of our findings by testing this polymorphism in a non-overlapping replication sample of 294 elderly subjects from a continuation of the first ADNI project (ADNI2) to minimize the risk of reporting false positive results. In both cohorts, the minor alleleâ€”previously linked with increased risk for addictionâ€”was associated with larger volumes in various brain regions implicated in reward processing. These findings suggest that neuroanatomical phenotypes associated with familial vulnerability for drug dependence may be partially mediated by DRD2 genotype.

19,"Comment on an article by Jianzhong Jin et al. (see record [rid]2011-16631-022[/rid]). The authors mapped the receptive fields of a large population of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) tiling a compact region of visual space. Authors found that linear summation of the LGN receptive fields connected to the cortical column generates spatial profiles that resemble those of simple cells. These findings are diverted as this can only coexist under a model in which the receptive fields of cortical cells are substantially constrained by the inputs. The implication would be that the orientation map must already be encoded in the partial segregation of ON and OFF inputs in the LGN an extraordinary finding indeed. The data by authors show, at first sight, a degree of overlap that is higher than expected from a simple replication of the RGC mosaic structure. This might be explained by the divergence from the retina to LGN and the fact that some LGN cells may pool more than one afferent. If, however, we consider that, to a first approximation, X cells in the LGN are generated by linear summation of RGC input and receptive fields in cortex are constructed by linear summation of LGN afferents, then one can understand that cortical neurons will be ultimately constrained by the output of the retina independently of the precise nature and coverage ratio of LGN receptive fields. Finally, all of these processes may proceed without the need for specific patterns of spontaneous thalamic activity as required in some activity- dependent models of development.

20,"Project aims to study social intelligence of the gifted and average students in different school environments varying on the dimension of enrichment. Two enriched environment and two non-enriched environment schools were selected from fifteen different schools that were studied for existing school environment. General Intelligence tests were used far selecting gifted and average students. Top 5% students were selected as gifted where as middle 50% were selected as average. The performance of these students on social intelligence tests was compared to identify the differences on two interacting dimensions. Intellectual potential and school climate. This comparison showed that enriched school environment was advantageous for the development of social intelligence among average students. In case of gifted students observed mean differences were insignificant. However, frequency analysis using chi-squire revealed that synergistic interaction between high genetic potential and enriched school environment results in the formation of small intra group clusters. Replication of the study in other places both inside and outside the country may be useful in identifying the sub cultural influences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

22,"The change detection task has been used in dozens of studies with adults to measure visual working memory capacity. Two studies have recently tested children in this task, suggesting a gradual increase in capacity from 5 years to adulthood. These results contrast with findings from an infant looking paradigm suggesting that capacity reaches adult-like levels within the first year. The current study adapted the change detection task for use with children younger than 5 years to test whether the standard version of the task was too difficult and may have underestimated childrenâ€™s capacity. Results showed that 3- and 4-year-olds could successfully complete this modified task and that capacity increased roughly linearly, from 2 or 3 items during this period to 3 or 4 items between 5 and 7 years. Furthermore, performance did not differ significantly between the modified version and a replication of the standard version with 5- and 7-year-olds. Thus, there is no evidence that previous research with the change detection task underestimated childrenâ€™s capacity. Further research is needed to understand how performance relates across the infant looking task and change detection to provide a more complete picture of visual working memory capacity over development.

24,"Sensory and consumer scientists are seeing the need to explore broader measures, such as product-driven emotions, to be able to fully understand and satisfy consumersâ€™ demands. However, to date, the consumer methodologies used in food-related emotion research have neglected a crucial element linked to emotions: the consumption context. This is a concern, because consumersâ€™ emotional responses to food are elicited by many other sources apart from the sensory properties of the food itself. The present research aimed to fill in this gap of knowledge by exploring how evoked consumption contexts affect responses obtained from an emotion questionnaire. Two food stimuli (apple and chocolate brownie) and three different consumption contexts (a â€˜weekend breakfastâ€™, an â€˜afternoon snackâ€™, and â€˜after a special dinnerâ€™) were used to vary the level of product-context appropriateness. A within-subject design was used in which 157 participants first completed an emotion questionnaire (36 terms, checklist format) in response to each of the evoked consumption contexts (presented in written format). A week later, the same participants completed the same emotion questionnaire while imagining themselves eating an apple or chocolate brownie (shown as images) without any given context (control condition), and then under the three different contexts (random monadic sequential order). When the chocolate brownie was the food stimulus, 20 of 36 emotion responses were significantly different from context to context (including the no-context condition). Conversely, only 9 significant differences were established when apple was the food stimulus. It was also found that frequency of use of positive emotion terms was higher in those consumption contexts that were considered more appropriate, whereas negative emotion terms were more frequently selected when the context was perceived as less appropriate for the product. Taken together, these findings highlight how the context in which a food is consumed (even if imagined) can affect consumersâ€™ emotion responses towards it. More broadly, they demonstrate the reciprocal effect that the context and the product have on the elicited emotion responses, which are not situationally invariant. This research also explored how psychological traits related to emotional eating affected the emotion responses and found that in general higher emotional eaters selected a higher number of emotion terms (positive and negative). This study represents a needed advance in food-related emotion research, and upon replication of the results with other product-context combinations, could offer an easy-to-implement methodology that should more closely match the emotion responses that consumers would elicit in real-life situations while eating and drinking.

Despite many methodological differences and shortcomings, progressive NAA reductions could be seen in several brain regions implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Choline, creatine, and myoâ€<U+FFFD>inositol levels remain largely unchanged and a timeâ€<U+FFFD>dependent role of glutamate finds confirmation in several spectroscopy studies.

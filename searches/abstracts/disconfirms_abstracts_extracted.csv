"1";"Aronson and Carlsmith (1962) indicated that Ss preferred to fail and confirm a failure expectancy than to be successful and disconfirm the expectancy. An attempted replication reported here did not support these findings. Instead, Ss appeared achievement oriented. It is suggested that, in the present studies, strong achievement motives may be suppressing expectancy effects. Therefore, no definitive refutation of expectancy theory is claimed.

"2";"In this study, the impact of implicit and explicit activation of gender stereotypes on men's and women's intentions to pursue a traditionally masculine career, such as entrepreneurship, was examined. On the basis of stereotype activation theory, it was hypothesized that men and women would confirm the gender stereotype about entrepreneurship when it was presented implicitly but disconfirm it when it was presented explicitly. Hypotheses were tested by randomly assigning 469 business students to one of 6 experimental conditions and then measuring their entrepreneurial intentions. Results supported the hypothesis when entrepreneurship was associated with stereotypically masculine characteristics but not when it was associated with traditionally feminine characteristics. Men also had higher entrepreneurial intention scores compared with women when no stereotypical information about entrepreneurship was presented, suggesting that underlying societal stereotypes associating entrepreneurship with masculine characteristics may influence people's intentions. However, men and women reported similar intentions when entrepreneurship was presented as gender neutral, suggesting that widely held gender stereotypes can be nullified. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"3";"""2 experiments were carried out to determine the cue used by Ss to anchor the serial position curve in rote learning. Exp. I was designed to evaluate the role of starting position and facilitated (pretrained) syllable in lists that contained no other cues as to beginning or end… . The results show that the Ss anchor the curve on the starting position. These findings contradict both facilitation and inhibition explanations of the serial position curve… . As an alternative to these it is suggested that the S makes a choice of anchor position and that any cue… may serve as anchor for the curve. From this it follows that E should be able to instruct the S as to the anchor point. In Exp. II the E varied the indication of the beginning of the list by means of verbal instructions. The results show that the anchor point can be manipulated in this manner."" (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"4";"Three clearly distinguishable types of collectivism—relations with family (familism), peers (companionship), and society (patriotism)—were found in a cross-cultural sample including 123 Estonians, 194 Americans, and 2 Russian populations (95 Ss from Narva and 50 from Moscow). The Estonian sample was the least collectivistic in those 3 areas of social relations, a finding that contradicts the popular claim that Estonia is a collectivistic country. The 2 Russian samples, from Moscow and Narva, were more collectivistic than the US and Estonian samples. The finding that the Russians living in Estonia were less collectivistic with regard to their families and society than the Russians from Moscow corroborates the general rule that those who have migrated to other countries are usually more individualistic than those who have stayed in their resident countries. The usefulness of the %S score (the percentage of a respondent's answers to the question ""Who am I?"" that referred to a group with which the respondent might share a common fate) for cross-cultural studies of collectivism is discussed.

"5";"Serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) may have an important role in the maintenance of normal neuropsychological functioning. The method of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) provides a pharmacological challenge by which central 5-HT levels can be temporarily decreased and effects on learning, memory and mood examined. Twenty healthy male volunteers were recruited to take part in this within-subject, double-blind, crossover study. Neuropsychological function was evaluated 4-6 h after ingestion of a control or 52 g tryptophan (TRP) depleting amino-acid drink. ATD significantly lowered levels of plasma total and free TRP (p < 0.001), but this did not affect mood or performance on tests of verbal and visuo-spatial learning and memory, attention or executive function. These results contradict previous findings; however, the degree of disruption of central 5-HT levels resulting from the use of the 52 g amino-acid protocol may be an important factor in explaining the lack of effect. By utilizing more specific probes of individual 5-HT receptor subtypes, future studies can fully explore the role of 5-HT in neuropsychological functioning and may elucidate the factors determining vulnerability to the effects of serotonergic dysfunction.

"6";"The ethnic-Chinese business is often characterised by a central role of the family both in the structure of the firm and in its corporate culture. This has political, social as well as cultural reasons. The centrality of the family in business has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it enables a fast, efficient and flexible process of decision-making. On the other hand, it often contradicts modern business professionalism. The younger generation of ethnic-Chinese business actors tend to preserve crucial elements of such family-centred characteristics. Yet, globalisation drives them to transform their business style, lessening its dependence on family resources and adopting more-modern professional ideas. Changes in current political situation, religious-cultural trend, demography and education contribute to making possible the transformation.

"7";"Examined 2 ways of explaining why leks of the great snipe evolve and why central males are more successful than peripheral males. The position hypothesis was compared with the attractiveness hypothesis, using observational data and results from 2 field experiments. When dominant males were removed, territories were left unoccupied by neighboring males. When subdominant or subordinate males were removed, territories were immediately occupied. When a stuffed male was presented, dominant males ignored the decoy, whereas other males approached and/or attacked it. Results support the attractiveness hypothesis and contradict the position hypothesis. Male aggregations during the mating period may have evolved because some males are unable to attract females on their own. The best mating strategy for such males would be to associate with attractive males. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"8";"Over the last two decades, the reinforcement of security-related migration policies has resulted in the perception of the foreigner, and especially the irregular migrant, as a category outside the circle of legality. The rights of foreigners in host countries have deteriorated due to the connection made between immigration and criminality. Restrictions imposed upon irregular migrants' basic political and civil rights have been accompanied by major obstacles to their access to economic and social rights, including the right to health. The events of 9/11 further contributed to this trend, which contradicts the basic premises of the human rights paradigm. Recent policy developments and ongoing international cooperation implementing systematic interception and interdiction mechanisms have led to the securitization of migration. The preventive and deterrent measures reinforce the security paradigm. By contrast, various national and international actors have been successful in defending irregular migrants' rights. At the domestic level, the involvement of the judiciary and civil society enhances the rights-based approach to foreigners. The role of judges is vital in holding policy-makers accountable for respecting the high national standards of human rights protection. This article elaborates on the dichotomy between the state's legitimate interest to ensure national security, and its domestic and international obligations to protect human rights for all, including irregular migrants. It focuses on the changing relationship between migration and security, on the one hand, and between state and individual, on the other hand. It affirms the necessity to recognize the pre-eminence of fundamental rights upon security concerns. This article draws on F. Crepeau and D. Nakache (2006).

"10";"This study examined the associations of gender and cultural clusters with two classical leadership styles: consideration and initiating structure. We used a unique database for this study: 64,000 subordinates evaluating the leadership behaviors of their direct supervisors (N = 13,595), representing 42 countries. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression analysis for cultural clusters. As hypothesized, culture had a stronger impact on leadership behaviors than gender, particularly on initiating structure. In line with predictions, female managers around the world used more consideration. Yet, unexpectedly, women also used more initiating structure. The results suggest that gender differences in managerial behavior are predominantly present in western societies. Results contradict classic stereotypes regarding male and female managerial behaviors. More theory is needed to understand the interaction between gender and culture in relation with leadership. Outcomes have practical implications for HRM practices in international firms and cross cultural leadership training, which should aim at reducing stereotypical thinking on female and male leadership attributes in different cultures.

"11";"Diffusion anisotropy monitored with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) is a sensitive marker to monitor developmental or pathological microstructural changes in spinal cord. The white matter is often treated as a unidirectional axonal bundle but collateral fibers branching off the main spinal pathways contradicts this assumption and affects the diffusion anisotropy. It is the aim of this study to investigate to what extent collateral fibers are apparent in diffusion tensor data and if collaterals can be detected as individual fiber directions using crossing fiber detection techniques. We calculate the diffusion tensor and the persistent angular structure (PAS), a multi-fiber reconstruction technique, from high quality post mortem data of a perfusion-fixed vervet monkey cervical spinal cord sample and simulated crossing fiber data. Our results show that (i) cylindrical geometry in the white matter of the spinal cord is an invalid assumption due to collateral fibers. We also demonstrate that (ii) collateral fibers can be resolved as distinct peaks in the water diffusion propagator in white matter using multi-fiber models. Finally, we show that (iii) crossing fibers are mainly located laterally and increase towards the cervical enlargement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

This research is a narration of some parts of an intersex life, an individual with a vague, unknown identity who contradicts the common norms of the society. In a traditional society, where gender and sexual identity act as a taboo and a powerful source of identity, people with uncommon (gender and sexual) identities suffer from an unstable social status.

"14";"Two studies examined dieter–nondieter differences in food perception, using a total of 96 female undergraduates. Ss were given cards containing the names of randomly selected generic foods (e.g., cakes, melons) and were asked to group the foods according to how they thought about them when they ate them. A restraint scale classified Ss as dieters and nondieters. Cluster analyses of the labels used by Ss to name their groups revealed 6 clusters. Four of these clusters showed similarity across the 2 studies: Enjoyment, Sensory Qualities, No Guilt, and Nutritional Qualities. In both studies, dieters had significantly higher scores on the No Guilt cluster than did nondieters, suggesting that dieters thought of food in terms of absence of guilt more than did nondieters. The findings contradict the notion that dieters simply dichotomize food into ""good"" and ""bad"" categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

"16";"We investigated the effects of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) versus computerized fixed item testing (FIT) of reasoning ability on current motivation in terms of situational fear of failure and subjective probability of success, as well as flow. A group of 174 students (aged 15–21) from two German secondary schools was presented either a CAT or a FIT version of a matrices test; motivational variables were assessed during a short break in testing. More situational fear of failure and less subjective probability of success were reported using CAT compared to FIT. Self-reported flow did not differ between test mode conditions. When we addressed the hypothesis that adaptive testing is equally motivating for both high and lower performers, test performance appeared to moderate the relationship of test mode and subjective probability of success: Only during FIT was subjective probability of success higher with lower test performance. This moderation effect was also revealed for the relationship of test mode and flow. However, as average reported motivation was lower during CAT, results contradict assumptions of enhanced motivation during CAT. Results are discussed in relation to self-concept relevance of testing domains and with reference to test fairness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"17";"This article explores the role of widely circulated images of Afghan people in building public support for the 2001-2002 U.S. war with Afghanistan. Emphasizing images of women, I argue that these representations participate in the more general category of ""the clash of civilizations,"" which constitutes a verbal and a visual ideograph linked to the idea of the ""white man's burden."" Through the construction of binary oppositions of self and Other, the evocation of a paternalistic stance toward the women of Afghanistan, and the figuration of modernity as liberation, these images participate in a set of justifications for war that contradicts the actual motives for the war. These contradictions have a number of implications for democratic deliberation and public life during wartime. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"18";"12 male Holtzman rats sustaining lateral hypothalamic (LH) lesions regulated their body weight at a reduced level when maintained for 1 mo postlesion upon a wet mash diet. Thereafter, for a period of 84 days, half of these Ss were offered a high fat diet, whereas the remaining Ss continued to receive wet mash. A series of palatable drinking solutions were also offered. Body weight remained at reduced levels relative to 8 intake controls regardless of the diet offered, even under conditions of high fluid intake generated by the palatable drinking solutions. Results contradict the interpretation of E. J. Mufson and R. S. Wampler (see record [rid]1973-00428-001[/rid]) that the lower body weight observed in LH-lesioned animals is secondary to lesion-produced ""finickiness"" and/or dehydration resulting from hypodipsia. Rather, a primary shift in the set point for body weight appears to underlie the reduced levels of weight maintenance in LH-lesioned animals.

"19";"Since a while the ethics of persuasive technology (PT) have been discussed. One interesting approach is the assessment of PTs in the light of discourse ethics and the speech-act theory as proposed recently. While some see such an approach as promising, the author will illustrate that the application of discourse ethics is only appropriate for a few limited persuasive strategies. It is argued that most often PT does not provide the essentials of a discourse; reason or arguments to convince the counterpart. In line with discourse ethics the elements of speech-act theory refer to the preconditions every debater has to subscribe to in order to reach a mutual understanding that is the ultimate goal of a discourse. It is evident that PT has to deal with serious problems in order to fulfill the preconditions such as comprehensibility, truth, truthfulness and legitimacy. If discourse ethics is the theoretical framework which reflects the moral content of PT, the intention of the designer and his arguments or reasons have to be taken into account. It is argued that this often contradicts the purpose of persuasion or manipulation if PT is applied. This paper provides propositions that should ensure that the design of PT fulfill the basic requirements of discourse ethics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

"20";"Presents an editorial on the state of prison research. The Future Organisation of Prison Health Care, a joint enterprise by HM Prison Service and the NHS Executive (Department of Health, 1999), launched the latest in a series of attempts to improve the health care available to prisoners. One of the actions recommended in that report was that 'a coherent programme of research to support the prison health development agenda should be devised and implemented'. Civil servants justify such studies as benchmarking exercises. However, the technology of standardized diagnosis is in a state of constant change. problem with benchmarking is that national figures are of little use when the problem must be solved at local level. Some prisons have good psychiatric services already; others show little sign of ever achieving them. Better detection of psychiatric disorders is central to the new arrangements, and services are encouraged to divert resources to screening programmes. The emphasis on screening assumes that prisoners are different from other users of health care. They are passive recipients of treatment, who have to be sought out and dragged into services. Research contradicts this view, and it implies that improvements in treatment should be the priority. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"21";"Consciousness is feeling, and the problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how and why some of the functions underlying some of our performance capacities are felt rather than just ""functed."" But unless we are prepared to assign to feeling a telekinetic power (which all evidence contradicts), feeling cannot be assigned any causal power at all. We cannot explain how or why we feel. Hence the empirical target of cognitive science can only be to scale up to the robotic Turing test, which is to explain all of our performance capacity, but without explaining consciousness or incorporating it in any way in our functional explanation.

"22";"149 female undergraduates evaluated 1 of 4 legal procedures in the presence of either a favorable or unfavorable outcome in a videotaped reenactment of a criminal trial. The procedures were adversarial, inquisitorial, adversarial without lawyer, and adversarial with plea bargaining. Data were gathered on the fairness and perceived satisfaction of the defendent with the final outcome and quality of the defense and prosecution. Contrary to previous research, results show that the different procedures were seen as equally fair and legitimate, which suggests that how a procedure is implemented may be more important than its structural properties in observers' overall evaluations. It was also found that defendants are seen as least satisfied when the ostensibly fairest procedure (adversarial) yields an unfavorable outcome. This finding supports a frustration interpretation and contradicts previous studies that report adversarial to be the most preferred dispute resolution procedure within all outcome conditions.

"25";"Compares the theory of ""insight-into-meaning"" of psychosomatics with the causal analytic research of scientific medicine. It is argued that the interpretation of symptoms is burdened with problems of hermeneutics (e.g., subjectivity of interpretation and absence of criteria for verification or rejection of a diagnosis). The physician who must treat a patient must have hypotheses that will aid him/her in making diagnoses and prognoses. The ""insight-into-meaning"" theory alone, however, does not provide a feasible method for treating a patient. Teleologic interpretation of the development of disease symptoms contradicts the criteria of empiric science, since the existence of a teleologic entity in the organism cannot be proved empirically. Attempts at interpretations of this kind illustrate the nature of such self-explanations. Proof of the validity of the rules of a system is necessary. Teleologic interpretation of biologic process should be replaced, after causal-analytic research has been conducted, by deductive-nomologic or inductive-statistical explanations.

"1";"Regression models for functional responses and scalar predictors are often fitted by means of basis functions, with quadratic roughness penalties applied to avoid over fitting. The fitting approach described by Ramsay and Silverman in the 1990s amounts to a penalized ordinary least squares (P-OLS) estimator of the coefficient functions. We recast this estimator as a generalized ridge regression estimator, and present a penalized generalized least squares (P-GLS) alternative. We describe algorithms by which both estimators can be implemented, with automatic selection of optimal smoothing parameters, in a more computationally efficient manner than has heretofore been available. We discuss point wise confidence intervals for the coefficient functions, simultaneous inference by permutation tests, and model selection, including a novel notion of point wise model selection. P-OLS and P-GLS are compared in a simulation study. Our methods are illustrated with an analysis of age effects in a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set, as well as a reanalysis of a now-classic Canadian weather data set. An R package implementing the methods is publicly available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"2";"R. F. Baumeister and A. Steinhilber's (see record [rid]1984-31312-001[/rid]) provocative, widely accepted analysis proposed that professional sports teams play unusually badly (choke) under the pressure created by their home fans and perform poorly in decisive home games of championship series. However, a reanalysis of the data, including the results of recent championships in baseball and basketball, finds no evidence of a home-field championship choke. The home field is an advantage, and the home team wins about as often late as early in championship series. Teams show an ability to triumph over pressure in asymmetrical ""must-win"" situations late in championship series. When choking occurs, it is associated with the anticipation of an important failure, not the distractions of possible success as suggested by Baumeister and Steinhilber.

"4";"The study investigated whether the P600/SPS component is sensitive to the richness of semantic content in sentences. ERPs were recorded while 30 native Swedish speakers read sentences, of which half were syntactically correct and half contained a syntactic violation. Both kinds of sentences came in one of three types of descending semantic completeness: semantically coherent sentences, sentences which were incoherent due to violations of selectional restrictions, or sentences of pseudo words, hence void of lexical content. In the semantically coherent sentences a P600/SPS was found for the syntactic violation. A less salient positivity was found for the violation in the semantically incoherent sentences. No P600/SPS was found for the syntactic violation in the pseudo word sentences and no LAN component in any sentence type. The results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that the P600/SPS component reflects a semantically based reanalysis process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The original article, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editors in Chief, Michelle De Haan and Charles Nelson and John Wiley & Sons Limited. The authors determined that the looking time coding performed by the first author, N. Mahajan, was inaccurate and did not reflect the looking times found by other trained coders. A reanalysis of the data reported in this paper failed to verify the reported effects, and thus the authors have requested that the publication be retracted.] Both human infants and adult non-human primates share the capacity to track small numbers of objects across time and occlusion. The question now facing developmental and comparative psychologists is whether similar mechanisms give rise to this capacity across the two populations. Here, we explore whether non-human primates' object tracking abilities are subject to the same constraints as those of human infants. In particular, we examine whether one primate species, the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), also fails to represent and enumerate objects when they behave non-rigidly or non-cohesively. We presented lemurs with a series of expectancy violation studies involving simple 1 + 1 addition events in which we varied the entities to be enumerated. Like infants, lemurs successfully enumerated the two objects when those objects were rigid, cohesive individuals, but failed to enumerate similar-looking non-rigid piles of sand. In contrast to human infants, however, lemurs successfully enumerated non-cohesive objects that broke into multiple pieces. These results are discussed in light of recent theories about object processing in human infants and adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"6";"Early components of visual evoked potentials (VEP) in EEG seem to be unaffected by target visibility in visual masking studies. Bridgeman's reanalysis of Jeffreys and Musselwhite's (1986) data suggests that a later visual component in the VEP, around 250 ms reflects the perceptual effect of masking. We challenge this view on the ground that temporal interactions between targets and masks unrelated to stimulus visibility could account for Bridgeman's observation of a U-shaped time course in VEP amplitudes for this later component. In an MEG experiment of metacontrast masking with variable stimulus onset asynchrony, we introduce a proper control, a pseudo mask. In contrast to an effective mask, the pseudomask should produce neither behavioral masking nor amplitude modulations of late VEPs. Our results show that effective masks produced a strong U-shaped perceptual effect of target visibility while performance remained virtually perfect when a pseudomask was used. The visual components around 250 ms after target onset did not show a distinction between mask and pseudomask conditions. The results indicate that these visual evoked potentials do not reveal neurophysiological correlates of stimulus visibility but rather reflect dynamic interactions between superimposed potentials elicited by stimuli in close temporal proximity. However, we observed a postperceptual component around 340 ms after target onset, located over temporal-parietal cortex, which shows a clear effect of visibility. Based on P300 ERP literature, this finding could indicate that working memory related processes contribute to metacontrast masking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

"7";"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about the impact of CBT on frontostriatal dysfunctioning, known to be the neuronal correlate of OCD. Method: A probabilistic reversal learning (RL) task probing adaptive strategy switching capabilities was used in 10 unmedicated patients with OCD and 10 healthy controls during an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Patients were scanned before and after intensive CBT, controls twice at comparable intervals. Results: Strategy change within the RL task involved activity in a broad frontal network in patients and controls. No significant differences between the groups or in group by time interactions were detected in a whole-brain analysis corrected for multiple comparisons. However, a reanalysis with a more lenient threshold revealed decreased responsiveness of the orbitofrontal cortex and right putamen during strategy change before treatment in patients compared with healthy subjects. A group by time effect was found in the caudate nucleus, demonstrating increased activity for patients over the course of time. Patients with greater clinical improvement, reflected by greater reductions in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores, showed more stable activation in the pallidum. Conclusions: Although these findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they indicate a possible influence of psychotherapy on brain activity in core regions that have been shown to be directly involved both in acquisition of behavioral rules and stereotypes and in the pathophysiology of OCD, the caudate nucleus and the pallidum.

"8";"We examined 14 patients with acute anteromedial pontomesencephalic infarctions for signs of vestibular and ocular motor dysfunction. In all cases, an isolated ipsilateral deviation of the subjective visual vertical (mean: 4.1, range: 2.7â€“6.6) was found without any further signs of vestibular or eye movement disorders like ocular torsion or skew deviation. Distinct lesions in thin-slice brainstem MRI showed an overlap zone in the medial portion of the medial lemniscus. The finding of putative ipsilateral vestibular projections running adjacent to or within the medial lemniscus was subsequently confirmed by a reanalysis of an anterograde tracer labelling study in the primate after tracer injection in the vestibular nucleus complex. The major conclusions of this study are as follows: (i) there is evidence for an ipsilateral graviceptive pathway running from the vestibular nuclei close to and within the medial lemniscus to the posterolateral thalamus [ipsilateral vestibulothalamic tract (IVTT)], (ii) this pathway might be the human homologue of the three-neuron sensory vestibulocortical tract described in primates and (iii) unilateral lesions of this pathway cause only vestibulo-perceptive dysfunction in the roll plane in contrast to lesions of the crossed graviceptive pathways (in the medial longitudinal fascicle), which were described earlier and which manifest as a combination of tilt of the subjective visual vertical, ocular torsion and skew deviation.

"9";"Background: International Remission Criteria (IRC) for schizophrenia were developed recently by a group of internationally known experts. The IRC detect only 10%â€“30% of cases and do not cover the diversity of forms and social functioning. Our aim was to design a more applicable tool and validate its useâ€”the Standardized Clinical and Functional Remission Criteria (SCFRC). Methods: We used a 6-month follow-up study of 203 outpatients from two Moscow centers and another further sample of stable patients from a 1-year controlled trial of atypical versus typical medication. Diagnosis was confirmed by International Classification of Diseases Version 10 (ICD10) criteria and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Patients were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, including intensity threshold, and further classified using the Russian domestic remission criteria and the level of social and personal functioning, according to the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The SCFRC were formulated and were validated by a data reanalysis on the first population sample and on a second independent sample (104 patients) and in an open-label prospective randomized 12-month comparative study of risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) versus olanzapine. Results: Only 64 of the 203 outpatients (31.5%) initially met the IRC, and 53 patients (26.1%) met the IRC after 6 months, without a change in treatment. Patients who were in remission had episodic and progressive deficit (39.6%), or remittent (15%) paranoid schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder (17%). In addition, 105 patients of 139 (51.7%), who did not meet symptomatic IRC, remained stable within the period. Reanalysis of data revealed that 65.5% of the patients met the SCFRC. In the controlled trial, 70% of patients in the RLAI group met the SCFRC and only 19% the IRC. In the routine treatment group, 55.9% met the SCFRC and only 5.7% the IRC. Results of the further independent sample demonstrated that 35% met the IRC, 65% the SCFRC, and 56% of patients met both the symptomatic and functional criteria. In the controlled trial of RLAI and olanzapine, 40% and 35% of patients, respectively, met the IRC, while 70% and 55%, respectively, met the SCFRC. Conclusion: In schizophrenia outpatients, a greater proportion of stable cases is detected in remission by SCFRC in comparison with IRC. The SCFRC were more sensitive to the full spectrum of schizophrenia. The SCFRC appear to be valid as a tool and clinically useful as they produce a comprehensive assessment of treatment effectiveness for a wide range of patients.

"11";"In ""Play, dreams and imitation in childhood"" (PDI), Jean Piaget provided an extensive corpus of situations in which children and adults interact, both verbally and nonverbally. These examples are the foundation upon which he built his theory of the early levels of development, upholding the thesis of a cognitive continuum between accommodation, imitation and symbolic representation, and firmly criticizing the hypothesis of the decisive role of the ""social life"" in this evolution. The author proposes a reinterpretation of the corpus contained in PDI, which brings to light that Piaget does not sufficiently take into account the adult's interventions at work during these interactions. The reanalysis confirms the primacy of accommodation over imitation, and agrees with Piaget that ""social life"" does not intervene, as such, in the development. However, it is only adult activity that proposes the social significations whose internalization will give rise to the symbolic representation, and that transforms the elementary psychical functioning into the specific functioning of human thought.

"12";"Objective: To investigate the effect of including unpublished trial outcome data obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the results of meta-analyses of drug trials. Design: Reanalysis of meta-analyses. Data sources: Drug trials with unpublished outcome data for new molecular entities that were approved by the FDA between 2001 and 2002 were identified. For each drug, eligible systematic reviews containing at least one meta-analysis were identified by searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library in November 2010. Selection criteria: Eligible systematic reviews were done after FDA approval of the drug, were published in English, and had outcomes and comparators that were the same as those of the trials with unpublished FDA trial outcomes, and the characteristics of participants in the systematic reviews were consistent with the FDA approved indication for the drug. Clinical guidelines, conference proceedings, duplicate systematic reviews, and systematic reviews in which included trials were not referenced or that combined trials across multiple drug classes were excluded. Systematic reviews using non-standard meta-analytic techniques (such as Bayesian or network meta-analyses) and those that used inappropriate or invalid methods for calculation of summary statistics (such as unweighted pooled analyses) were also excluded. Data extraction: Two authors independently extracted data from both the published systematic reviews and the FDAâ€™s medical and statistical reviews of the trials submitted to FDA. Main outcome measure: Summary statistics (risk ratios, odds ratios, or weighted mean differences) for relevant outcomes with and without unpublished FDA trial data. Results: 42 meta-analyses (41 efficacy outcomes, one harm outcome) for nine drugs across six drug classes were reanalysed. Overall, addition of unpublished FDA trial data caused 46% (19/41) of the summary estimates from the meta-analyses to show lower efficacy of the drug, 7% (3/41) to show identical efficacy, and 46% (19/41) to show greater efficacy. The summary estimate of the single harm outcome showed more harm from the drug after inclusion of unpublished FDA trial data. Conclusion: The effect of including unpublished FDA trial outcome data varies by drug and outcome. Unpublished FDA trial outcome data should be available and included in meta-analysis. Making these data easily accessible is particularly important because the effects of including unpublished data vary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"13";"The magnitude estimation of taste intensity has often produced exponents greater than 1, suggesting that the perceived intensity of some taste stimuli increases at a faster rate than does stimulus concentration (i.e., the psychophysical functions are positively accelerating). However, a reanalysis of published data reveals that when these magnitude scales are replotted in linear coordinates, instead of the conventional logâ€“log form, there is often no evidence of positive acceleration and the numerical value of the exponent bears no reliable relationship to the shape of its psychophysical function. Reasons for this finding are discussed and the implications for taste research are noted. (35 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"14";"Presents the design, implementation and simulation results of a psycholinguistic model of human syntactic processing that meets major empirical criteria. The parser operates in conjunction with a lexicalist grammar and is driven by syntactic information associated with heads of phrases. The dynamics of the model are based on competition by lateral inhibition. Input words activate lexical frames in the mental lexicon, and a network of candidate 'unification links' is set up between frame nodes. These links represent tentative attachments that are graded rather than all-or-none. Candidate links that, due to grammatical or 'treehood' constraints, are incompatible, compete for inclusion in the final syntactic tree by sending each other inhibitory signals that reduce the competitor's attachment strength. The outcome of these local and simultaneous competitions is controlled by dynamic parameters. Simulations are reported of a significant range of psycholinguistic parsing phenomena in both normal and aphasic speakers of English: (i) various effects of linguistic complexity; (ii) effects of local and global ambiguity, and of word-class and syntactic ambiguity; (iii) certain difficulty-of-reanalysis effects; and (iv) effects of agrammatism on parsing performance.

"15";"This article presents a reanalysis of the data of 862 second and fourth graders collected in two previous studies, focusing on the influence of method (psychometric vs. chronometric) and stimulus type on the gender difference in mental-rotation accuracy. The children had to solve mental-rotation tasks with animal pictures, letters, or cube figures, either in a chronometric condition (computerized) or in a psychometric condition (paper-and-pencil). Results show a slight male advantage in mental-rotation accuracy, which is neither influenced by method nor by stimulus type. However, mental-rotation accuracy differed between the stimulus types, with the highest accuracy in animal pictures and the lowest accuracy in cube figures, and between age groups, with better performance in fourth graders than in second graders in both conditions. Results show that psychometric and chronometric mental-rotation tests with all the stimulus types are more or less similarly usable with children of that age.

"16";"Recently, a number of model selection heuristics (i.e. DIFFIT, CORCONDIA, the numerical convex hull based heuristic) have been proposed for choosing among Parafac and/or Tucker3 solutions of different complexity for a given three-way three-mode data set. Such heuristics are often validated by means of extensive simulation studies. However, these simulation studies are unrealistic in that it is assumed that the variance in real three-way data can be split into two parts: structural variance, due to a true underlying Parafac or Tucker3 model of low complexity, and random noise. In this paper, we start from the much more reasonable assumption that the variance in any real three-way data set is due to three different sources: (1) a strong Parafac or Tucker3 structure of low complexity, accounting for a considerable amount of variance, (2) a weak Tucker3 structure, capturing less prominent data aspects, and (3) random noise. As such, Parafac and Tucker3 simulation studies are run in which the data are generated by adding a weak Tucker3 structure to a strong Parafac or Tucker3 one and perturbing the resulting data with random noise. The design of these studies is based on the reanalysis of real data sets. In these studies, the performance of the numerical convex hull based model selection method is evaluated with respect to its capability of discriminating strong from weak underlying structures. The results show that in about two-thirds of the simulated cases, the hull heuristic yields a model of the same complexity as the strong underlying structure and thus succeeds in disentangling strong and weak underlying structures. In the vast majority of the remaining third, this heuristic selects a solution that combines the strong structure and (part of) the weak structure.

"17";"Language comprehension is assumed to proceed incrementally, and comprehenders commit to initial interpretations even in the absence of unambiguous information. Initial ambiguous object arguments are therefore preferably interpreted as subjects, an interpretation that needs to be revised towards an object initial interpretation once the disambiguating information is encountered. Most accounts of such grammatical function reanalyses assume that they involve phrase structure revisions, and do not differ from other syntactic reanalyses. A number of studies using measurements of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) provide evidence for this view by showing that both reanalysis types engender similar neurophysiological responses (e.g., P600 effects). Others have claimed that grammatical function reanalyses rather involve revisions of the mapping of thematic roles to argument noun phrases (NPs). In line with this, it has been shown that grammatical function reanalysis during spoken language comprehension engenders a N400 effect, an effect which has been shown to correlate with general problems in the mapping of thematic roles to argument NPs in a number of languages. This study investigated the ERP correlate to grammatical function reanalysis in Swedish. Postverbal NPs that disambiguated the interpretation of object-topicalised sentences towards an object-initial reading engendered a N400 effect with a local, right-parietal distribution. This ""reanalysis N400"" effect provides further support for the view that grammatical function reanalysis is functionally distinct from syntactic reanalyses and rather involves a revision of the mapping of thematic roles to the sentence arguments. Postverbal subject pronouns in object-topicalised sentences were also found to engender an enhanced P300 wave in comparison to object pronouns, an effect which seems to depend on the overall infrequency of object-topicalised constructions. This finding provides support for the view that the â€˜â€˜reanalysis N400â€™â€™ in some cases can be attenuated by a task-related P300 component.

"19";"During language comprehension, people sometimes have to revise their grammatical analysis of a sentence. Experimental evidence demonstrates that such reanalysis often causes processing difficulty. We might therefore predict that reanalysis would be disfavored, with the processor preferring not to reanalyze when it had a choice. Three experiments on complementâ€“clause ambiguities investigate the conditions under which the processor chooses to reanalyze. We contrast two extreme positions, one where the processor avoids reanalysis whenever possible, the other where reanalysis is not disfavored at all. We also consider intermediate positions, in which the preference to maintain the current analysis is one factor that affects ambiguity resolution. The experiments demonstrate that the processor avoids reanalysis even when other factors would support it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

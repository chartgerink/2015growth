"1";"The neuroscientific investigation of sex differences has an unsavoury past, in which scientific claims reinforced and legitimated gender roles in ways that were not scientifically justified. Feminist critics have recently argued that the current use of functional neuroimaging technology in sex differences research largely follows that tradition. These charges of â€˜neurosexismâ€™ have been countered with arguments that the research being done is informative and valuable and that an over-emphasis on the perils, rather than the promise, of such research threatens to hinder scientific progress. To investigate the validity of these contrasting concerns, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations of sex differences and citation practices were systematically examined. In line with the notion of neurosexism, the research was found to support the influence of false-positive claims of sex differences in the brain, to enable the proliferation of untested, stereotype-consistent functional interpretations, and to pay insufficient attention to the potential plasticity of sex differences in both brain and mind. This, it is argued, creates a literature biased toward the presentation of sex differences in the brain as extensive, functionally significant, and fixedâ€”and therefore implicitly supportive of a gender essentialist perspective. It is suggested that taking feminist criticisms into account would bring about substantial improvement in the quality of the science, as well as a reduction in socially harmful consequences.

"2";"Discusses criteria for use in determining eligibility for prenatal Down's syndrome (DS) testing. The authors comment on the article by N. J. Wald et al (see record [rid]1999-03900-001[/rid]) which describes an integrated test for first- and second-trimester DS screening. The authors find the method of Wald et al clinically and ethically troubling since the pregnant woman would not be informed of the heightened risk during the first trimester and not be given the option to terminate at that time. The costs to be considered in deciding which screening tests for DS should be offered to pregnant women are discussed, including economic costs, miscarriage rates, and false positive results. The authors favor a stepwise approach when advising women on screening for DS. The first test is a careful measurement of nuchal translucency and measurements of serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and the free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin at 10â€“14 wks. If an increased risk of DS is found, the woman would have the option of undergoing chorionic-villus sampling then or amniocentesis later. If no risk is found, other options would still be available.

"3";"In studies of clinical depression, individuals who demonstrate elevated levels of symptoms but do not meet interview-based diagnostic criteria are typically labeled as false positive and eliminated from further consideration. However, the implicit assumption that false-positive participants differ in important ways from true-positive (i.e., diagnosed) participants has not been tested systematically. This study compared the functioning of true-positive, false-positive, and true-negative adolescents on clinical and psychosocial functioning. Although the false-positive participants manifested higher levels of current and future psychopathology than did the true-negative participants, they did not differ significantly from the true-positive participants on most of the measures of psychosocial dysfunction. ""False positive,"" therefore, is not a benign condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was administered to 80 patients with Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores of 15 or above. With this screen clinically relevant depressive symptoms can be established. For diagnosing major depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) was administered to 57 patients using a MMSE cut-off of 20. 49% of the respondents showed a score above the GDS cut-off (> 11), which means having clinically relevant depressive symptoms. 16% met the criteria for major depression according to DIS. Nursing home physicians recognized 39% of the patients with clinically relevant depressive symptoms and 67% of those with a major depression. Nurses recognized depressive patients slightly better but they were less specific in their judgment (more false-positive rates). It was also found that in situations in which physicians and nurses had the same opinion the recognition of depression improved. Therefore, it is recommended that physicians and nurses exchange their judgments on patients' mood on a regular basis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"5";"Administered the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) to 30 nondepressed diabetic patients (aged 18â€“75 yrs) to investigate the specificity of the DST as a test for major depression. Age-matched control groups were composed of 23 male Ss (aged 16â€“78 yrs) and 35 female Ss (aged 16â€“73 yrs) with no known psychiatric disorder. Diabetic Ss had both a significantly greater prevalence of nonsuppressed responses and of mean plasma cortisol level when compared with findings in normal controls at 4 PM the day after administration of dexamethasone. Thus, as a diagnostic test for major depression, the DST seems to yield a high rate of falseâ€“positive responses among diabetics, and hence its results must be interpreted with caution in these patients.

"6";"Introduction: Diagnosis of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) is supported by a suggestive clinical presentation and associated with a heterozygous contraction of the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35. State of the art: The FSHD1 phenotype has a widely variable course with great inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity. Three clinical forms can be distinguished: the classical phenotype associated with four to seven repeat units (RU) and a variable course, a severe infantile form with one to three RU, and a mild phenotype associated with borderline UR (8 to 10 RU). At the molecular level, for D4Z4 contraction to be pathogenic, it needs to occur on a specific chromosomal background, namely on the 4qA allelic variant of chromosome 4. In most cases, once FSHD is clinically suspected, the diagnosis can be genetically confirmed with a DNA test using Southern Blotting and hybridization to a set of probes. However, diagnosis of FSHD1 remains challenging. Firstly, some patients may present with an atypical phenotype with highly focal or unusual symptoms. Secondly, there are potential pitfalls in the genetic diagnosis of FSHD resulting in false positive or false negative results. In the absence of genetic confirmation, other investigations, mainly EMG and muscle biopsy, are needed to rule out another diagnosis. In cases with no clear diagnosis and a permissive chromosome without contraction, FSHD2 may be suspected. Perspectives: Molecular combing is a new technique which permits visualization and sizing of the D4Z4 repeat array on its genetic background on stretched single DNA fibers by fluorescence microscopy. This tool will improve genetic diagnosis in FSHD patients. Conclusion: Diagnosis of FSHD1 is mainly supported by clinical features. Clinicians need to be aware of unusual presentations of this disease. The wide spectrum of intrafamilial variability and the lack of good correlation between genotype and phenotype present challenges for genetic counseling and prognostication. More studies are needed concerning penetrance and genotypeâ€“phenotype correlation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"7";"Background: The advent of Internet-based self-help systems for common mental disorders has generated a need for quick ways to triage would-be users to systems appropriate for their disorders. This need can be met by using brief online screening questionnaires, which can also be quickly used to screen patients prior to consultation with a GP. Objective: To test and enhance the validity of the Web Screening Questionnaire (WSQ) to screen for: depressive disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, GAD, PTSD, social phobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, and OCD. Methods: A total of 502 subjects (aged 18-80) answered the WSQ and 9 other questionnaires on the Internet. Of these 502, 157 were assessed for DSM-IV-disorders by phone in a WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview with a CIDI-trained interviewer. Results: Positive WSQ â€œdiagnosisâ€<U+FFFD> had significantly (P < .001) higher means on the corresponding validating questionnaire than negative WSQ â€œdiagnosisâ€<U+FFFD>. WSQ sensitivity was 0.72-1.00 and specificity was 0.44-0.77 after replacing three items (GAD, OCD, and panic) and adding one question for specific phobia. The Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) of the WSQâ€™s items with scaled responses were comparable to AUCs of longer questionnaires. Conclusions: The WSQ screens appropriately for common mental disorders. While the WSQ screens out negatives well, it also yields a high number of false positives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"

Both AD and PD groups committed more prior-story and extra-list intrusion errors (IEs), but AD Ss committed more extra-story IEs. Also, AD Ss made more extra-list IEs and recognized more false positive targets than PD Ss. AD and PD Ss seem to have different patterns of memory dysfunction. AD Ss seem unable to inhibit irrelevant information and to have increased sensitivity to interference, whereas the deficits of PD Ss seem to reflect only a sensitivity to proactive interference.

"9";"Background: Clinical research has developed slowly in most academic hospitalist programs, possibly because of a failure to recognize the important role of specialists in the diagnosis and management of complex medical patients as well as their expertise in clinical research. Ideally, a successful hospital-based clinical research program will need to partner hospitalists with specialists. Purpose: The University of Michigan's Specialist-Hospitalist Allied Research Program (SHARP) was designed to jumpstart hospital-based clinical and translational research at a major academic medical center by pairing specialists and hospitalists to ask and answer novel research questions. Description: SHARP is co directed by a hospitalist and a sub specialist and includes key personnel such as a hospitalist investigator, a clinical research nurse, a research associate, and a clinical epidemiologist. The program is guided by an oversight committee that includes institutional research leadership. Two initial projects have already been supported. The first, a collaboration between infectious disease specialists and hospitalists, is a prospective trial of antiseptic agents and techniques to reduce false-positive blood cultures. The second pairs geriatricians and clinical pharmacists with hospitalists to prospectively study techniques to reduce medication errors around the time of hospital discharge. Although initial pilot projects are single-institution studies, SHARP'S goal is to expand its clinical research to include multicenter investigation. Metrics to evaluate SHARP include the number of successfully completed projects, extramural grants submitted and funded, and peer-reviewed publications. Conclusion: A successful hospital-based clinical research program combines hospitalists and specialists in a collaborative environment to identify optimal strategies for delivering inpatient care.

"10";"Aims and objectives. To explore coping with the perceived psychosocial consequences of a falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive screening mammography. Background. Mammographic screening has been found effective to decrease breast cancer (BC) mortality, yet there are adverse effects. Psychosocial consequences of falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive mammographic screening have mainly been investigated from a populationâ€<U+FFFD>based perspective. A call for qualitative studies to further explore these consequences has thus been postulated. To date, qualitative studies have elucidated women's experiences following their recall breast examinations, but their coping with perceived psychosocial consequences of a falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive screening mammography has not yet been explored. Design. An explorative qualitative study. Methods. Faceâ€<U+FFFD>toâ€<U+FFFD>face interviews were held with a purposive heterogeneous sample of 13 Swedishâ€<U+FFFD>speaking women with a falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive screening mammography. The transcripts were analysed by the use of an inductive content analysis. Results. Coping with the perceived psychosocial consequences of a falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive screening mammography implied a roller coaster of emotion and sense. Women described how they imagined the worst and were in a state of uncertainty feeling threatened by a fatal disease. Conversely, they felt protected, surrounded by their families and being professionally taken care of, which together with perceived sisterhood and selfâ€<U+FFFD>empowerment evoked strength and hope. Being aware of family responsibility became a crucial matter. Experiencing falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive screening raised thoughts of thankfulness and reappraisal of life, although an ounce of BC anxiety remained. Consequently, gained awareness about BC screening and values in life surfaced. Conclusions. Experiencing a falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive screening mammography triggers agonising experiences evoking a variety of coping strategies. Provision of screening raises the issue of responsibility for an impact on psychosocial wellâ€<U+FFFD>being among healthy women. Relevance to clinical practice. Gained knowledge might provide a basis for interventions to prevent psychosocial consequences of falseâ€<U+FFFD>positive mammographic screening and provide support for women with a potentially compromised ability to overcome such consequences.

"11";"Do negative quantifiers like â€œfewâ€<U+FFFD> reduce peopleâ€™s ability to rapidly evaluate incoming language with respect to world knowledge? Previous research has addressed this question by examining whether online measures of quantifier comprehension match the â€œfinalâ€<U+FFFD> interpretation reflected in verification judgments. However, these studies confounded quantifier valence with its impact on the unfolding expectations for upcoming words, yielding mixed results. In the current event-related potentials study, participants read negative and positive quantifier sentences matched on cloze probability and on truth-value (e.g., â€œMost/Few gardeners plant their flowers during the spring/winter for best resultsâ€<U+FFFD>). Regardless of whether participants explicitly verified the sentences or not, true-positive quantifier sentences elicited reduced N400s compared with false-positive quantifier sentences, reflecting the facilitated semantic retrieval of words that render a sentence true. No such facilitation was seen in negative quantifier sentences. However, mixed-effects model analyses (with cloze value and truth-value as continuous predictors) revealed that decreasing cloze values were associated with an interaction pattern between truth-value and quantifier, whereas increasing cloze values were associated with more similar truth-value effects regardless of quantifier. Quantifier sentences are thus understood neither always in 2 sequential stages, nor always in a partial-incremental fashion, nor always in a maximally incremental fashion. Instead, and in accordance with prediction-based views of sentence comprehension, quantifier sentence comprehension depends on incorporation of quantifier meaning into an online, knowledge-based prediction for upcoming words. Fully incremental quantifier interpretation occurs when quantifiers are incorporated into sufficiently strong online predictions for upcoming words.

Accurate and timely estimates of the incidence of brain injury and the prevalence of long-term problems associated with brain injuries among active duty service members and veterans are essential for (a) operational planning, and (b) to allocate sufficient resources for rehabilitation and ongoing services and supports. The purpose of this article is to discuss challenges associated with post-deployment screening for MTBI. Multiple screening methods have been used in military, Veterans Affairs, and independent studies, which complicate cross-study comparisons of the resulting epidemiological data. We believe that post-deployment screening is important and necessaryâ€”but no screening methodology will be flawless, and false positives and false negatives are inevitable. Additional research is necessary to refine the sequential screening methodology, with the goal of minimizing false negatives during initial post-deployment screening and minimizing false positives during follow-up evaluations.

"16";"This study investigates the prediction of violence in psychiatric patients through five simple questions. This study found that 30 of 128 patients were violent in the 5 years studied, with 83% being predicted as violent by screening (sensitivity), and a false negative rate of 17%. The positive predictive value was poor at 38% but the negative predictive value was impressive at 92%. The factors predicting later violence were being male, having a history of violence, a history of drug misuse, a prior criminal conviction, a history of alcohol misuse, poor treatment adherence and being less than 32 years old. A history of self-harm was only seen in 20% of those who were violent later. The rates of 5-year violence in the three separate groups were 35% in the forensic sample, 6% in addictions, and 36% in the acute community crisis resolution home treatment group. The results raised two interesting points. First, that these five simple questions might aid clinical decision-making concerning which patients will not pose a risk of later violence, but does not elucidate prediction on who will become violent. Second, it is hard to define who is a forensic patient when compared patterns across our three samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)"
"17";"This study proposes an iterative dual-regression (DR) approach with sparse prior regularization to better estimate an individual's neuronal activation using the results of an independent component analysis (ICA) method applied to a temporally concatenated group of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (i.e., Tc-GICA method). An ordinary DR approach estimates the spatial patterns (SPs) of neuronal activation and corresponding time courses (TCs) specific to each individual's fMRI data with two steps involving least-squares (LS) solutions. Our proposed approach employs iterative LS solutions to refine both the individual SPs and TCswith an additional a priori assumption of sparseness in the SPs (i.e.,minimally overlapping SPs) based on LÂ¹-norm minimization. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of this approach, semi-artificial fMRI data were created from resting-state fMRI data with the following considerations: (1) an artificially designed spatial layout of neuronal activation patterns with varying overlap sizes across subjects and (2) a BOLD time series (TS) with variable parameters such as onset time, duration, and maximum BOLD levels. To systematically control the spatial layout variability of neuronal activation patterns across the â€œsubjectsâ€<U+FFFD> (n=12), the degree of spatial overlap across all subjects was varied from a minimum of 1 voxel (i.e., 0.5-voxel cubic radius) to a maximum of 81 voxels (i.e., 2.5-voxel radius) across the task-related SPs with a size of 100 voxels for both the block-based and event-related task paradigms. In addition, several levels of maximum percentage BOLD intensity (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0%) were used for each degree of spatial overlap size. From the results, the estimated individual SPs of neuronal activation obtained from the proposed iterative DR approach with a sparse prior showed an enhanced true positive rate and reduced false positive rate compared to the ordinary DR approach. The estimated TCs of the task-related SPs from our proposed approach showed greater temporal correlation coefficients with a reference hemodynamic response function than those of the ordinary DR approach.Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed DR approach was also successfully demonstrated by the results of real fMRI data acquired from left-/ right-hand clenching tasks in both block-based and event-related task paradigms.

"18";"Objective: Valid definitions of dementia should discriminate dementia from other forms of cognitive impairment such as intellectual disability (ID). We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of criteria for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in ID, including predictive validity, and inter-rater reliability. Method: We assessed 222 participants in a survey of older adults with ID without Down syndrome at two time points for dementia (T1 and T2). Mean follow-up period was 2.9 years. Dementia diagnoses were made according to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition), Diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders for use with adults with learning disabilities (DC-LD) criteria. At follow-up (T2), raters were blind to initial diagnosis. Predictive validity was determined by comparing odds ratios (ORs) of death, or of having a â€œpoor outcomeâ€<U+FFFD> (i.e., either dying or being diagnosed with dementia at T2). Results: All dementia criteria showed substantial inter-rater reliability (Îº > 0.68) and high specificity (âˆ¼95%). Dementia cases at T1 were more likely to have died at T2 than those with no dementia (33.3% versus 14.9%; OR: 2.85; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.12â€“7.22) and to have a â€œpoor outcomeâ€<U+FFFD> (77.8% versus 27.6%; OR: 9.18; 95% CI: 3.43â€“24.53). At least two dementia cases at T1 were false positives. Those with â€œMCIâ€<U+FFFD> at T1 were similar to â€œno dementiaâ€<U+FFFD> cases in terms of poor outcomes at T2. Conclusion: Dementia diagnostic criteria show substantial reliability and satisfactory validity in ID. The diagnoses were, however, less stable than in the general population and some caution is advisable in those with more severe ID or additional sensory disability. MCI definitions require further consideration in the ID population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"

"20";"Recently, a debate has emerged on the use and necessity of standardization in experimental testing using animal subjects. The difficulties encountered when trying to reconcile standardization and generalization largely underlie this debate. The more specific the testing procedures are, the less one can generalize to more naturalistic situations, including to human clinical populations. If the goal of a study is to generalize to a larger population, there may be a higher risk attached to false-positive than false-negative results; thus the balance sways toward generalization. Heterogenization of housing conditions and of genetic makeup of experimental animals has been suggested as a possible method to increase the generalizability of results. It is important to remain cognizant, however, of situations in which false negatives can be counterproductive or even dangerous, such as when the goal is to elucidate a physiological mechanism, when expected effect sizes are small, in toxicological studies and in drug safety testing. In such cases, experiments based on standardization may provide more useful information. We pose that it is essential that the goal of the specific experiment conducted is clearly defined and that the decision to balance between standardization and generalization must be made based on the specific needs to meet the intended goal. In this light, we discuss a multi-tiered approach to animal experimentation, in which standardization and generalizability are each given precedence during different phases of a project, depending upon the goal of the experiment.

"22";"Aim: Accurate detection of recurrent disease and restaging are essential in the postoperative surveillance of many patients with pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs). In this study, the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (CT) with Â¹Â¹C-hydroxyephedrine (HED) was evaluated for the postoperative surveillance and diagnosis of recurrent disease and for functional monitoring of locoregional and systemic therapy. Methods: One hundred and eleven HED-PET and PET/CT examinations performed in 48 patients after surgical intervention for PHEO/PGL were analyzed retrospectively. In a subgroup of 16 patients who underwent systemic and locoregional therapies, the tracer uptake in tumors was also measured as the functional volume (FV), maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean) and as the total catecholamine transporter tumor volume (TCTTV) calculated as TCTTV = FV Ã— SUVmean. The PET imaging results were correlated with CT/magnetic resonance imaging findings and biochemical and clinical follow-up data. Results: In the first postoperative examination, HED-PET was positive in 24/48 and negative in 24/48 patients with no false-positive results, yielding 92.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. For the 16 patients, there was a significant correlation between FV and SUVmax and SUVmax and TCTTV. TCTTV correlated significantly with plasma and urinary catecholamines. In 11/16 patients, SUVmax and TCTTV increased/decreased in parallel but not in the remaining 5 patients. Conclusion: HED-PET and PET/CT were found to be valuable in the postoperative follow-up in detecting recurrent and metastatic disease. In a subgroup of patients, functional monitoring of systemic and locoregional therapies was feasible by assessing the changes of the TCTTV, and therefore warrants further prospective evaluation.

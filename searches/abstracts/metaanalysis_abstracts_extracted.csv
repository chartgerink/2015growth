"1";"Background: Persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) often show challenging behaviour. We review distinct interventions that are applied to treat these challenging behaviours, and analyse intervention effects and moderating variables. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the databases ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Medline. A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out, supplemented with sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression and publication bias analyses. Results: Eighty potential articles were identified, from which 30 contained sufficient data to enable statistical meta-analysis. From these 30 studies, 18 described a biological, 13 a psychotherapeutic and nine a contextual intervention, either applied alone or combined. The overall standardised mean difference was 0.671 (SD = 0.051). As shown by sensitivity analysis, this summary effect size is robust. Assessed through subgroup and meta-regression analysis, all tested moderators showed no statistically significant association with the treatment effects. After applying a funnel plot-, a fail-safe N-, and Duval's and Tweedie's trim and fill-analysis, we conclude that our meta-analysis does not suffer much from publication bias effects. Conclusions: Several biological, psychotherapeutic and contextual interventions effectively reduce challenging behaviours among persons with ID.

"2";"Individual differences in the cardiovascular response to stress play a central role in the reactivity hypothesis linking frequent exposure to psychosocial stress to adverse outcomes in cardiovascular health. To assess the importance of genetic factors, a meta-analysis was performed on all published twin studies that assessed heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) reactivity to the cold pressor test or various mental stress tasks. For reactivity to mental stress, the pooled heritability estimate ranged from 0.26 to 0.43. Reactivity to the cold pressor test yielded heritability estimates from 0.21 to 0.55. An ensuing review of genetic association studies revealed a number of genes, mostly within the sympathoadrenal pathway, that may account for part of the heritability of cardiovascular stress reactivity. Future progress in gene finding, that should include measures of sympathetic and vagal stress reactivity, may help uncover the molecular pathways from genetic variation to stress reactivity.

"3";"Settles a discrepancy between the results of a meta-analysis that found calcium to be highly effective in preventing preeclampsia and the large placebo-controlled multicenter 1997 trial of the National Institute of Health Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention's CPEP trial which found no reduction of preeclampsia risk in healthy nulliparous women due to calcium supplementation. The article also assesses the role of effect heterogeneity in the discrepancies. The authors use all available trials of calcium supplementation for the prevention of preeclampsia published prior to the CPEP trial. The authors reanalyzed the data, focusing attention on issues relevant to effect heterogeneity and understanding its sources. Their results remain consistent with the null hypothesis of no reduction in preeclampsia risk due to calcium supplementation in healthy low-risk populations. For healthy high-risk S populations, however, the results imply a beneficial calcium effect. The authors conclude that a random model cannot cure all levels of heterogeneity, especially when underlying heterogeneity is not minimal.

"5";"This article is about biochemical evidence of exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). It is well known that tobacco use leads to disease, and that SHS exposure is also harmful; indeed, there is no known safe level of exposure. According to the most recent estimates from the World Health Organization. 600,000 people worldwide die prematurely every year of exposure to SHS. Of these deaths attributable to SHS, 28% occur in children. This number excludes the millions of children worldwide who experience morbidity from SHS exposure. The harmful effects of SHS are found, with in utero exposure associated with changes in arterial structure and distensibility in early childhood. Whether this difference persists is not known, but it suggests that the vascular changes that lead to cardiovascular disease can be traced to parental smoke exposure. A study provides more piece of evidence for the importance of smoking cessation, in particular, among families with young children and those planning to have children. A meta-analysis of published intervention trials that were designed to protect children from tobacco smoke exposure through parental cessation or modification of parental smoking patterns. We can see that the effects of SHS may go deeper, and linger longer, than we had previously understood. We must use the evidence available to help motivate adults to change their smoking behavior to protect their children and others from the harms of SHS and increase their efforts to quit.

"7";"The efflux pump Pâ€<U+FFFD>glycoprotein (Pâ€<U+FFFD>gp), a gene product of the ABCB1 gene, plays a pivotal role in the transfer of various molecules across the bloodâ€“brain barrier. Pâ€<U+FFFD>gp protects the brain by selectively extruding its substrates, including certain antidepressive drugs, thereby limiting their uptake into the brain. Uhr et al. [2008] first showed that ABCB1 variants predicted the remission to antidepressants with Pâ€<U+FFFD>gp substrate properties in patients suffering from major depression (MD). Other studies investigating the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on antidepressant treatment response produced inconclusive results. In this metaâ€<U+FFFD>analysis, we systematically summarized 16 pharmacogenetic studies focused on the association of ABCB1 variants and antidepressant treatment outcome in patients with MD (overall n = 2695). We investigated the association of treatment outcome and six ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs2032583, rs2235015, rs2235040, rs1045642, rs2032582, rs1128503. We stratified for admission status, ethnicity, and prescription of concomitant medication. SNP rs2032583 showed a nominally significant association across all studies (P = 0.035, SNP was studied in a total of 2,037 patients) and a significant Bonferroniâ€<U+FFFD>corrected association among inpatients (P = 1.5 Ã— 10âˆ’05, n = 485). Also SNP rs2235015 was significantly associated with antidepressant treatment outcome withstanding Bonferroni correction (P = 3.0 Ã— 10âˆ’04) among inpatients in a smaller subsample (n = 195). There were no significant associations of the other SNPs tested with antidepressant treatment outcome. Future pharmacogenetic association studies should focus on the role of the ABCB1 SNP rs2032583 in antidepressant outcome prediction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

"8";"Making sense of a neuroimaging literature that is growing in scope and complexity will require increasingly sophisticated tools for synthesizing findings across studies. Meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies fills a unique niche in this process: It can be used to evaluate the consistency of findings across different laboratories and task variants, and it can be used to evaluate the specificity of findings in brain regions or networks to particular task types. This review discusses examples, implementation, and considerations when choosing meta-analytic techniques. It focuses on the multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) framework, which has been used in recent studies to evaluate consistency and specificity of regional activation, identify distributed functional networks from patterns of co-activation, and test hypotheses about functional cortical-subcortical pathways in healthy individuals and patients with mental disorders. Several tests of consistency and specificity are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"9";"Background: The late onset of therapeutic response and a relatively large proportion of nonresponders to antidepressants remain major concerns in clinical practice. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective medication strategies that augment treatment with antidepressants. Methods: To review the available evidence on the use of lithium as an augmentation strategy to treat depressive episodes. Results: More than 30 open-label studies and 10 placebo-controlled double-blind trials have demonstrated substantial efficacy of lithium augmentation in the acute treatment of depressive episodes. Most of these studies were performed in unipolar depression and included all major classes of antidepressants, however mostly tricyclics. A meta-analysis including 10 randomized placebo-controlled trials has provided evidence that lithium augmentation has a statistically significant effect on the response rate compared to placebo with an odds ratio of 3.11, which corresponds to a number-needed-to-treat of 5. The meta-analysis revealed a mean response rate of 41.2% in the lithium group and 14.4% in the placebo group. One placebo-controlled trial in the continuation treatment phase showed that responders to acutephase lithium augmentation should be maintained on the lithium-antidepressant combination for at least 12 months to prevent early relapses. Preliminary studies to assess genetic influences on response probability to lithium augmentation have suggested a predictive role of the â€“50T/C single nucleotide polymorphism of the GSK3Î² gene. Conclusion: Augmentation of antidepressants with lithium is currently the best-evidenced augmentation therapy in the treatment of depressed patients who do not respond to antidepressants.

"10";"Both clinicians and researchers have long known that the majority of depressed patients do not achieve or sustain a complete recovery from their disorders on most therapies. This has led to anecdotal reports and to clinical trials that suggest a broad range of interventions involving some combination of medications. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study examined response to treatment in a large sample of 3,671 patients with major depressive disorder. The patients were those typically encountered in primary care and psychiatry settings. The study found that even after 12-14 weeks of adequately dosed citalopram, only 37% of the patients achieved remission. The study indicates that most patients will require additional treatments. The common choices after initial treatment failure are to switch to another antidepressant, add a second antidepressant start psychotherapy or augment with a compound not approved for use as an antidepressant. Many different compounds have been used for augmentation including stimulants, modafinil, buspirone, pindolol, estrogen, and testosterone. Few controlled studies of these agents have been performed, and with the exception of a single modafinil study the controlled studies have failed to show an advantage for augmentation with these agents. Thyroid augmentation has been more extensively studied. Reviews and meta-analyses indicate thyroid augmentation does accelerate response but the placebo-controlled trials in resistant depression fail to show an advantage.

"11";"Background: Although some studies evaluated the effectiveness of massage therapy for fibromyalgia (FM), the role of massage therapy in the management of FM remained controversial. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence of massage therapy for patients with FM. Methods: Electronic databases (up to June 2013) were searched to identify relevant studies. The main outcome measures were pain, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and appraised risk of bias. The risk of bias of eligible studies was assessed based on Cochrane tools. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by more conservative random-effects model. And heterogeneity was assessed based on the I2 statistic. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials involving 404 patients met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analyses showed that massage therapy with duration â‰¥5 weeks significantly improved pain (SMD, 0.62; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.20; p = 0.03), anxiety (SMD, 0.44; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78; p = 0.01), and depression (SMD, 0.49; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84; p = 0.005) in patients with FM, but not on sleep disturbance (SMD, 0.19; 95% CI 20.38 to 0.75; p = 0.52). Conclusion: Massage therapy with duration â‰¥5 weeks had beneficial immediate effects on improving pain, anxiety, and depression in patients with FM. Massage therapy should be one of the viable complementary and alternative treatments for FM. However, given fewer eligible studies in subgroup meta-analyses and no evidence on follow-up effects, large-scale randomized controlled trials with long follow-up are warrant to confirm the current findings.

"12";"Comments on an article, ""Predicting the development of schizophrenia in high-risk populations: systematic review of the predictive validity of prodromal criteria"" by J. Chuma & P. Mahadun (2011). Chuma & Mahadun report on a much needed and topical meta analysis of prospective studies investigating the predictive validity of prodromal criteria in schizophrenia. The potential importance of early identification and treatment cannot be underestimated. The authors should be congratulated for helping clarify whether the identification component is currently worthwhile. I have no doubt that this paper is generally well conducted and for the 'ultra-high-risk strategy' sample size reasonable but I am afraid I cannot agree with their interpretation of results. In particular, they conclude that that both ultra-high-risk and basic-symptoms criteria are valid and useful tools in predicting the future development of schizophrenia among the 'at-risk population', and that ultra-high-risk criteria were able to 'correctly predict schizophrenia', while being able to 'exclude this condition with some certainty'. appreciate that many might find these statistical terms confusing. Previously, I have proposed a simple adjustment of false positives and false negatives per every 100 patients seen, which I called real-world interpretation/yield. So, for every 100 individuals thought to be at risk and subject to ultra-high-risk criteria, 17 would be correctly classified as converters to schizophrenia and 4 would be missed; and 53 would be correctly classified as non-converters but 26 would be falsely identified. In effect, there would be six times as many false positives as false negatives. I therefore ask the authors to reconsider whether these approaches are entirely valid for both rule-in and rule-out purposes when the data suggest mainly the latter.

"13";"A foundational assumption in meta-analysis is that effect sizes (EFSs) based on scores from different measures are directly comparable. Recent theoretical work has shown that in order for EFSs to be comparableâ€”in the sense of being interchangeable across measuresâ€”the EFSs must be based on scores meeting two conditions: construct equivalence and the reliabilities of the scores from these measures must be equal. No research has investigated the consequences for meta-analytic analyses and comparisons if the EFSs are based on scores failing to meet these two conditions. This article reports the results of a simulation study investigating the effects of various magnitude violations of the combination of construct equivalence and equal reliabilities on the outcomes of meta-analytic comparisons of EFSs. The results suggest that as violations of construct equivalence and equal reliabilities increase in magnitude, the results of a meta-analysis can change substantially with respect to the relative ordering of effect size magnitudeâ€”including changes in the rank ordering of EFSâ€”merely as a function of which measures are used in the various studies included in the meta-analysis. The implications of these results for meta-analysis are considered and important lines of future research identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"

This study explores temporal variation of dementia prevalence in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan taking study methods into account. Methods: Seventy prevalence studies of dementia in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were identified from 1980 to 2012. Five period groups (before 1990, 1990 ~ 1994, 1995 ~ 1999, 2000 ~ 2004 and 2005 ~ 2012) and five birth cohort groups (1895 ~ 1909, 1910 ~ 1919, 1920 ~ 1929, 1930 ~ 1939 and 1940 ~ 1950) were categorised using the year of investigation and 5â€<U+FFFD>year age groups. Pooled prevalence by age, period and birth cohort groups was estimated through metaâ€<U+FFFD>regression model and metaâ€<U+FFFD>analysis taking diagnostic criteria and age structure into account. Results: After adjusting for diagnostic criteria, the study age range and age structure, the prevalence of dementia in the older population aged 60 years and over fluctuated across periods but not reaching significance and were estimated as 1.8%, 2.5%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 3.1% for the five periods from preâ€<U+FFFD>1990 to 2005 ~ 2012. A potential increasing pattern from less to more recent birth cohort groups was found in the major studies using older diagnostic criteria with wider differences in the age groups over 70 years. Conclusions: This study found no significant variation across periods but suggested a potential cohort effect. The influence of societal changes might moderate early life experiences across different generations with substantial impact on mental health in older age.

Ruptures in the therapeutic alliance are defined as episodes of tension or breakdown in the collaborative relationship between patient and therapist. Two meta-analyses were conducted. The first reviewed studies examining the relation between rupture-repair episodes and treatment outcome (r = .24, z = 3.06, 95% CI [.09, .39], p = .002, k = 3, N = 148). The second meta-analysis reviewed the research examining the impact on treatment outcome of training therapists in the use of alliance rupture intervention principles (prepost r = .65, z = 5.56, 95% CI [.46, .78], p < .001, k = 8, N = 376). Both meta-analyses provided promising evidence regarding the relevance of alliance rupture-repair processes to therapeutic outcome.

"17";"In the wake of repeated long-term criticism of blind reliance on simple hypothesis testing via an observed statistic and a p value, the American Psychological Association currently recommends including other methods such as reporting effect sizes, meta-analyses, graphical data presentation, and reporting confidence intervals (CIs). In this brief article, I first discuss some of the merits of reporting CIs and mention several sources that advocate the use if CIs, and I further elucidate their computation and interpretation in various circumstances. Second, I discuss a caveat regarding the use of CIs that apparently has not been widely recognized, although it is fairly obvious. The point to be made is that violation of assumptions that affect the true value of Î± (the probability of a Type I error) in a significance test will also affect the precision of the corresponding 100(1 - Î±)% CI.

We thank Dekker and Van for their letter, in which several short-term psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy trials are referenced; however, only one such trial met inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis, and we thus only focused on ascertaining therapist qualifications in that particular study. The term psychotherapists left room for interpretation, which was why we coded short-term psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy (SPSP) as not clearly a bona fide intervention. In systematically reviewing the criteria for a bona fide therapy, it would appear, based on the additional information provided by Dekker and Van that therapists were well supervised and received training in SPSP. However, we have one remaining concern: in neither the original trial nor the letter to the editor is the term psychotherapist clearly linked to any particular educational background; it is unclear whether all such therapists had a masterâ€™s degree- level education in mental health. The term psychotherapist is not typically regulated in the United States, where our research team resides. Therefore, in many areas of the United States, people with quite limited educational backgrounds may call themselves psychotherapists and provide therapy services despite a lack of in-depth training.

"23";"Previous neuroimaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nearby brain regions in deception. This is consistent with the hypothesis that lying involves the executive control system. To date, the nature of the contribution of different aspects of executive control to deception, however, remains unclear. In the present study, we utilized an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) method of meta-analysis to quantitatively identify brain regions that are consistently more active for deceptive responses relative to truthful responses across past studies. We then contrasted the results with additional ALE maps generated for 3 different aspects of executive control: working memory, inhibitory control, and task switching. Deception-related regions in dorsolateral PFC and posterior parietal cortex were selectively associated with working memory. Additional deception regions in ventrolateral PFC, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex were associated with multiple aspects of executive control. In contrast, deceptionrelated regions in bilateral inferior parietal lobule were not associated with any of the 3 executive control constructs. Our findings support the notion that executive control processes, particularly working memory, and their associated neural substrates play an integral role in deception. This work provides a foundation for future research on the neurocognitive basis of deception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"

Method: The importance of diagnosing and providing therapeutic management for hypoactive sexual desire disorder will be explained with a case scenario which is resolved by drawing on original trial publications and meta-analyses published in English. Results: Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is highly prevalent (9â€“16%) and has a strong impact on the quality of life of both women and their partners. Medical and sexual history, physical and laboratory examinations as well as validated questionnaires will help us make an accurate diagnosis. Treatment should begin by focusing on lifestyle and psychosexual therapy. Women randomized to oestrogenâ€“testosterone transdermal patch combination or testosterone transdermal patch alone reported significantly increased frequency of satisfying sexual activity (p < 0.05). Hormonal treatment with oestrogen and testosterone or with testosterone alone should be personalized, as should follow-up.

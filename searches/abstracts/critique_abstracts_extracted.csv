Gollob's (see 43:2) factor-analytic variation (FANOVA) analysis and an Eckart-Young resolution of original data are compared and illustrated with a fictitious body of data. When transformations of factor matrices (rotation of axes) are included in the analysis, a number of points of equivalence occur between the 2 analyses. A major point of difference concerns representation of mean responses. In the FANOVA model, mean responses to stimuli are taken as characteristics of the stimuli; in the Eckart-Young resolution of original data, the mean responses are described in terms of the centroid of factor scores. A preference is stated for later representation as an aspect of description of the population of a person. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

"3";"Comments on the article by W. R. Staines (see record [rid]2001-14574-005[/rid]), which found that in the early states, bilateral movement enhanced activation in the primary motor cortex compared with unilateral paretic hand movement. However, at later stages, activation of the affected hemisphere did not differ between unilateral and bilateral movement. The present authors obtained analogous results in a group of 30 patients with hemiplegic stroke. These Ss were examined with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) within the first week, 1 mo, and 6 mo after stroke. As previously reported (1999), the response of the damaged side to contralateral movement was low during the 1st 2 measurements, but increased with time and reached a normal pattern at the last measurement. In a reply, Staines et al note that using differing but complementary techniques (TCD and functional magnetic resonance imaging) converged to the same conclusion about blood flow velocity after stroke. Data from these two studies provide evidence of possible interhemispheric influences on cortical motor reorganization early after stroke. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

"5";"Comments on the article by R. D. Marshall et al (see record [rid]1999-01651-001[/rid]) which raised considerations regarding the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. According to the present authors, Marshall et al confounded evidence used for the construct (predictive) validity of dissociative symptoms in acute stress disorder with their importance as symptoms per se. Marshall et al's contention that since dissociative symptoms are a less than perfect predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), then such symptoms should be dropped from acute stress disorder, represents a tautological argument. Dissociative symptoms are only a minor component of the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) PTSD criteria, as are amnesia and numbness. If anything, the problem may be that PTSD needs redefinition. The present authors discuss ""pathologization"" issues, and the fact that some studies that were not cited have found a clear and strong predictive power for dissociative symptoms.

"6";"Jackson and Fulford (1997), using the tools of analytic philosophy, have proposed a model allowing principled differentiation between spiritual experience and psychotic symptoms based on the personal values of the subject, a cognitive problem-solving model. Spiritual experience is described as positively evaluated psychotic experience, which enables the subject to do more than he or she normally does. In the present paper, it is claimed that values and actions cannot alone always discriminate between religious experience and psychopathology. With reference to three case studies, drawn from the practice of one of us, it is argued that spirituality is not all about experience and that it cannot be understood without reference to the subject's personal history and spiritual tradition, however implicit or fragmented. This approach would allow an account of ordinary religious experience in those who have suffered ego disablement during mental illness. Drawing primarily on the Christian tradition, we argue that the use of theological criteria may allow levels of discrimination between spiritual experience and mental disorder not allowed for by philosophical psychopathology.

"8";"Discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the behavioral approach in psychotherapy and suggests that some of the weaknesses of the approach can be overcome by integrating it with client-centered and psychodynamic approaches. Some of the strengths of this approach include operationalization of therapeutic procedures, the systematic study of cognitions, and the notions of competence and skill training. It is contended that the weaknesses of the behavioral approach include the following: an overly narrow theory of human functioning; an ignoring of the importance of the therapeutic relationship; an avoidance of transference; a failure to measure the real environment and to assure generalization; an overestimating of the average behavioral clinician's success rates; an underestimating of the length of intervention required; a naÃ¯vetÃ© about family systems, institutions, and social systems; and an inability to admit personal and technical limits. It is further suggested that the clinician or theoretician interested in breaking down unnecessary barriers between schools of psychotherapy can choose from many alternative types of rapprochement. Some of the risks associated with an integrated model of psychotherapy are noted. (French abstract) (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

The attraction to many men of so called â€œherbalâ€<U+FFFD> or â€œall-naturalâ€<U+FFFD> remedies for the treatment of erectile dysfunction is understandable. There is the perception that herbal compounds are somehow safer than prescription medicines. Also, in most cases, they are less expensive, and by ordering online, buyers have anonymity and can avoid the embarrassment of discussing erectile dysfunction with doctors and pharmacy staff. However, what most consumers do not realize is that many of these products do contain pharmaceutical agents, such as sildenafil or tadalafilâ€”otherwise, they likely would have no efficacy at all. In fact, the samples collected from convenience stores, filling stations, and customs seizures and studied using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry by Campbell et al. demonstrated that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor adulteration is widespread in purportedly herbal/natural over-the-counter dietary supplements.

"11";"Comments on an article by H. Chen et al. (see record [rid]2010-07143-006[/rid]). Chen et al. explored the possibility of a biologic mechanism inhibiting the development of Parkinson disease (PD) in long-term smokers. Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (B-HCH)â€”a persistent environmental contaminant, organochlorine pesticide, and environmental estrogenâ€”was found more often in patients with PD than in controls. B-HCH has high lipophilicity, elevated resistance to metabolism, extreme persistence in human tissues, and an estimated half-life of 10 years. It resists environmental cleansing and bioaccumulates in fatty tissues. The beneficial effect of smoking on prevention of development of PD may be through blocking harmful estrogenic effects of organochlorine pesticides such as the environmental estrogen B-HCH, which is highly concentrated in patients with PD. The environmental estrogens may interfere with normal physiologic estrogenic functions in the brain and body. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

"13";"Comments on an article by David Graeber (see record [rid]2011-18373-001[/rid]). The article is a trenchant reminder of how problematic the categories of political economy are for anthropological analysis. The first step in thinking beyond these categories is to excavate them, which Graeber does with his fascinating genealogy of the concept of desire in the Western philosophical tradition. To the extent that consumption studies have become ubiquitous and many of them fail to define or even think through what is meant by the term ""consumption"", Graeberâ€™s critique is all the more cogent. One of the key contributions of Graeberâ€™s approach, then, is to get us to consider the possibility of different models to analyze activities we have been lumping under the consumption rubric. Indeed, Graeber suggests in his history of Western desire that food plays a particular role: he sees it as key to the transition from medieval and Renaissance to modern notions of consumption, from erotics to gastronomics. Graeberâ€™s argument that we move beyond the categories of consumption and production fits very well with an interest in food preparation or cooking. A reexamination of the usefulness of consumption as a theoretical category opens up all kinds of new possibilities, and in this Graeber is right on target.

"16";"Rejoins to the reply made by Joseph Wolpe (see record [rid]2011-17897-018[/rid]) to the comments, Lecture presented at Middlesex Hospital, London, August 6, 1959 (1969) and Effects of cognitive desensitization on avoidance behaviour (1957) made by the current authors on the original article, The Practice of Behavior Therapy (1969). Wolpe asserts that we have incorrectly attributed to him Jacobsonâ€™s position regarding the role of proprioceptive feedback from relaxed muscles in the inhibition of anxiety. As we have pointed out elsewhere, it was not clear from Wolpeâ€™s publications prior to 1966 that he did not at least implicitly agree with Jacobsonâ€™s theoretical position. Wolpeâ€™s proposed experiment, in which Ss are told â€œBe calm"" when snake stimuli are presented, would contribute nothing to our understanding of this phenomenon. ""Be calm"" is simply one way of suggesting to a S that he not be afraid. In fact, we can similarly interpret the muscle relaxation induction as another way of saying â€œBe calm,â€<U+FFFD> and desensitization itself could then be seen as nothing more than suggestion. As far as ""resensitization"" is concerned, we find this to be another prevalent myth in the behavior modification literature; as we have pointed out elsewhere.

"17";"Lacan has left a teaching, mainly in his â€œseminarsâ€<U+FFFD>, which is often synthesized, simplified and reduced to a simple explanatory theory, principally regarding psychotic process. Such a simplifying view can become a discriminatory, iatrogenic conception of the psychotic person and of the psychotherapeutic (or psychoanalytical) treatment. In the first part of this paper, the author tries to show that Lacanâ€™s teaching was principally a transmission of the psychoanalysis itself, in different ways, as half-sayings, ambiguity, poetry and style, topology, mathemsâ€¦ Lacan passed himself on as a possibility of analytical opening, like in a cure. He does not generate a rational discourse, but he proposed several different theories as simple â€œvectorsâ€<U+FFFD>. In the second part, the author puts some concepts as â€œName of Father foreclosureâ€<U+FFFD>, â€œborromean knotâ€<U+FFFD> and â€œobject aâ€<U+FFFD> into a political (within the psychoanalytical community) and historical context. If those items of Lacanâ€™s teaching are diverted from their primal function of â€œvectorsâ€<U+FFFD> and are considered as explanatory theories, then they lose their pertinence and can lead to a stigmatizing conception and to possibly iatrogenic attitudes in the treatment. That will be examined further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"

Smith et al. concluded that the prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment is substantially higher among Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australians. A relationship between dementia and Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-I appears to exist based on comparable data. In the nervous system, Hp-I may be associated with autoimmune sequelae development observed in peripheral neuropathies and Alzheimers disease (AD). It would be interesting to know if Smith et al. considered comparable data in their Indigenous Australian participants who would be expected to present with high Hp-I prevalence. Such data may be important considering the many ways that Hp-I could influence the pathophysiology of dementia. Further pathogenetic mechanisms include conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, induction of molecular mimicry by the saccharide part of lipopolysaccharides of Hp with host antigens, release of pro inflammatory and vasoactive agents, and induction of apoptotic processes.

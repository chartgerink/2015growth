"1";"Purpose: To assess the effects of dexmedetomidine on the duration of sensory and motor block, postoperative analgesia, hypotension, bradycardia, and side effects in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Methods: Two researchers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane controlled trial register independently for randomized controlled trials comparing dexmedetomidine with a placebo without any language restrictions. Results: A total of 412 patients from eight trials were included in this study. The results revealed that dexmedetomidine was statistically significant in prolonging the duration of sensory block (mean difference, MD = 73.55; 95% CI, [55.69, 91.40] P < 0.00001, IÂ² = 89%) and motor block (MD = 59.11; 95% CI, [29.58, 88.65] P < 0.00001, IÂ² = 91%) and the time to first request for postoperative analgesia (MD = 245.77, 95% CI, [143.53, 348.00] P < 0.00001, IÂ² = 98%). The occurrence of hypotension (OR = 0.60, 95% CI, [0.3â€“1.23], P = 0.40, IÂ² = 3%) and side effects (OR = 0.9, 95% CI, [0.36â€“2.22], P = 0.88, IÂ² = 0%) was not significantly different between dexmedetomidine and placebo. However, dexmedetomidine was associated with more frequent bradycardia requiring atropine (OR = 7.55; 95% CI, [2.76â€“20.63], P = 0.63, I2 = 0%). Conclusions This meta-analysis has shown that dexmedetomidine prolonged the duration of spinal anesthesia and improved postoperative analgesia and did not increase the incidence of hypotension and adverse events, but needs more atropine to reverse bradycardia.

"2";"Previous studies examining the possible role of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms in the development of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) have provided inconclusive findings, this meta-analysis was therefore designed to get a more reliable assessment. A total of 38 articles were identified through a search of electronic databases, up to 27 February 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence interval (CIs) were calculated using random effects models. Meta-analysis showed that MTHFR C677T was significantly associated with SZ, the highest OR was found for the recessive model (for TT vs. CT + CC: OR = 1.34, 95 % CI: 1.18â€“1.53); a marginal association of MTHFR C677T with increased risk of BPD has also been found for the recessive model (OR = 1.26, 95 % CI: 1.00â€“1.59). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that the significant association with SZ and BPD existed among Asian and African populations, but not for the white. MTHFR A1298C was significant associated with SZ, the highest OR for the dominant model (OR = 1.13, 95 % CI: 1.03â€“1.24). Subgroup analysis indicated a significant association with SZ existed in Asian populations, not among the white populations and no significant association was detected between the MTHFR A1298C and BPD in all groups. We conclude that MTHFR polymorphism is associated with SZ and BPD among Asian, African populations, but not the white. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

"3";"Tested reports in international literature on the efficacy of carbamazepine (CBZ) in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) features through a meta-analysis. Out of 29 reports that dealt with CBZ with regard to behavior problems, activity level, and CBZ in children, 7 open studies and 3 double blind placebo controlled studies provided sufficient information for meta-analysis. These were coded for 13 characteristics, including S demographics, diagnostic features, study design, medication, and side-effects. Therapeutic responses were significant in the open studies. There was a positive correlation between duration of treatment and positive outcome. The remaining 3 studies show that CBZ was significantly more effective than placebo at controlling target symptoms. It is concluded that despite the lack of attention to CBZ, there is preliminary evidence that it may be an effective alternate treatment in children with ADHD.

"4";"Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by the obstruction of the upper airway, is the most common type of sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and positional therapy have been shown to be effective to improve positional OSA. Aim: To compare the effectiveness of positional therapy versus CPAP on positional OSA. Methods: Prospective randomized trials were systematically searched from the OVID databases. The trials comparing positional therapy versus CPAP in patients with positional OSA were included. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), mean oxygen saturation level, arousal index, sleep efficiency, and sleep time were the outcomes of this meta-analysis. Results: Three crossover trials were identified from Canada, New Zealand, and United States from 1999 to 2010. A total of 71 patients were randomly assigned to receive CPAP or positional therapy and the mean age of patients was 51 y. Positional therapy showed higher AHI (mean difference, MD: 4.28, 95% CI: 0.72â€“7.83) and lower oxygen saturation level (MD: âˆ’1.04, 95% CI: âˆ’1.63 to âˆ’0.46) than CPAP. It showed no distinct advantage over CPAP in terms of arousal index, sleep efficiency, and total sleep time, but CPAP reduced sleep time in the supine position. Conclusion: CPAP is superior to positional therapy in reducing the severity of sleep apnea and increasing the oxygen saturation level in patients with positional OSA.

"5";"Comments on an article by Rob B. Briner & Denise M. Rousseau (see record [rid]2011-04912-002[/rid]). Briner and Rousseau's characterization of a systematic review as a penultimate procedure for evidence-based practice in applied psychology is misleading in that a systematic review is likely to unnecessarily discard useful data leading to potentially erroneous conclusions that can adversely affect workers, organizations, and the public. Furthermore, although there is much to like about Briner and Rousseau's identification of shortcomings in some current efforts to generate cumulative knowledge within practice-oriented domains of applied psychology, their discussion confounds the usefulness of meta-analysis as a research methodology with researchers' use of meta-analytic methods. This distinction between methodology and methodologist is important, as current meta-analytic methodology, along with some of the recommendations in Briner and Rousseau's commentary, has considerable potential for advancing evidence-based practice beyond that of the so-called systematic review. Slavin's notion of a ""best-evidence synthesis"" that combines the optimal features of meta-analysis with qualitative data and varied stakeholder input would appear to still provide the most promising means for generating ""best evidence"" and ""best practice"" in applied psychology.

"6";"The authors conducted a meta-analysis of C. E. Rusbult's Investment Model of commitment. Across 52 studies, including 60 independent samples and 11,582 participants, satisfaction with, alternatives to, and investments in a relationship each correlated significantly with commitment to that relationship. Moreover, these three variables collectively accounted for nearly two-thirds of the variance in commitment. Commitment, in turn, was found to be a significant predictor of relationship breakup. Support for the model was obtained in predicting commitment in both relational domains (e.g., commitment to a romantic partnership) and nonrelational domains (e.g., commitment to one's job), but was significantly stronger in relational domains. Additional moderator analyses suggested that the associations between commitment and its theorized bases vary minimally as a function of demographic (e.g., ethnicity) or relational (e.g., duration) factors. The authors review theoretical strengths and shortcomings of the Investment Model and identify directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7";"Background: Depression is a major burden for the health-care system worldwide. Most care for depression is delivered by general practitioners (GPs). We assessed the rate of true positives and negatives, and false positives and negatives in primary care when GPs make routine diagnoses of depression. Methods: We undertook a meta-analysis of 118 studies that assessed the accuracy of unassisted diagnoses of depression by GPs. 41 of these studies were included because they had a robust outcome standard of a structured or semistructured interview. Findings: 50,371 patients were pooled across 41 studies and examined. GPs correctly identified depression in 47.3% (95% CI 41.7% to 53.0%) of cases and recorded depression in their notes in 33.6% (22.4% to 45.7%). 19 studies assessed both rule-in and rule-out accuracy; from these studies, the weighted sensitivity was 50.1% (41.3% to 59.0%) and specificity was 81.3% (74.5% to 87.3%). At a rate of 21.9%, the positive predictive value was 42.0% (39.6% to 44.3%) and the negative predictive value was 85.8% (84.8% to 86.7%). This finding suggests that for every 100 unselected cases seen in primary care, there are more false positives (n=15) than either missed (n=10) or identified cases (n=10). Accuracy was improved with prospective examination over an extended period (3â€“12 months) rather than relying on a one-off assessment or case-note records. Interpretation: GPs can rule out depression in most people who are not depressed; however, the modest prevalence of depression in primary care means that misidentifications outnumber missed cases. Diagnosis could be improved by re-assessment of individuals who might have depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"8";"Numerous international studies have been completed on the issue of personality differences between spiritual and religious people, although none of these studies have ever been conducted in Italy. More specifically, two tools have been used to analyse these differences: the Big Five Questionnaire (Caprara, Barbaranelli, Borgogni, 1993) and the RASâ€”Scala di Atteggiamento Religioso (Religious Attitude Scale) (Laudadio, Baumgartner, D'Alessio, in press), which were administered to a sample of 3,019 people (52.26% females) with an average age of 40. The analyses confirm a relationship between the dimensions of ""Personality"", ""Religiosity"" and ""Spirituality"". The cluster analysis shows that ""Religious Believers"" are more 'Conscientious' and 'Friendly' but less 'Energetic' and 'Emotionally Stable' compared to the other two groups. This result is in line with what has been shown by Saregleu (2002) in the conclusion of his meta-analysis. Numerous gender differences have been observed regarding the relationship between these two constructs and certain features, which may be attributable to the specific characteristics of Italians in relation to the dimensions of ""spirituality"" and ""religiosity"".

"9";"Previous studies suggest that physical activity may be protective for dementia and cognitive impairment. We report findings comparing leisure-time and work-related physical activity from the Caerphilly Prospective study (CaPS) with dementia and cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND) after around 16 years of follow-up. We synthesized our results with a meta-analysis specifically testing if length of follow-up was associated with the size of any association. Age-adjusted models found no real association with dementia, and if anything increased risk for CIND (odds ratio (OR) highest versus lowest tertile 2.61, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.31), though this was attenuated after adjustment for other confounders (OR highest versus lowest tertile 1.38, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.44). There was no evidence that this differed by type (vascular versus non-vascular) of cognitive disease. Meta-analysis of other published effect estimates showed a protective effect of physical activity on cognitive impairment (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85) but with significant heterogeneity which was partially explained by length of follow-up (p = 0.03). A protective association was also seen for dementia (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65, 0.94), which did not appear to be related to follow-up length but there was evidence of small study bias (p = 0.002) suggesting an absence of small null studies. The apparent protective effects of physical activity on cognitive health may partially reflect reverse causation and current estimates may be overly optimistic in terms of cognitive benefits.

In the present study we evaluated the empirical evidence for the link between insecure attachment and anxiety from early childhood to adolescence. A meta-analysis of 46 studies, from 1984 to 2010, including 8,907 children, was conducted. The results show an overall effect size of r = .30, indicating that attachment is moderately related to anxiety. Moderator analyses indicated that ambivalent attachment showed the strongest association with anxiety. Further, the relation was stronger during adolescence, when attachment and anxiety were measured through questionnaires, when the informant was the child, when attachment was measured as internal working model, in cross-sectional studies, and in studies conducted in Europe. No difference was found between studies that measured anxiety as symptoms or as a disorder, and when different kinds of anxiety were considered.

There is a significant need to understand the phenomena of pain and to know which treatments reduce pain. Currently, insufficient evidence based data are available for many pain treatments to enable reliable evaluation of effectiveness. The collections of invited chapters contained in this book go some way to bridging this gap. The focus of this book is on topics relating to effective pain management. The book contains 24 chapters that have relevance for clinicians, educators and researchers of all health disciplines. Topics covered in the book are comprehensive including health outcomes and treatment effectiveness in pain medicine, qualitative research with people who live with chronic pain, determining and measuring patient treatment preferences, assessment of pain in clinical trials, the placebo effect in clinical pain trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention studies, paediatrics and pain outcomes, headache and outcomes measurement in cancer pain. This text makes an important contribution to health professionals across disciplines that are requiring a resource for the use of measures and tools that may be used to assess evidence surrounding medical interventions to relieve pain.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-11487-005[/rid].) Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a significant clinical problem for more than 10 million adults diagnosed with cancer each year worldwide. No ""gold standard"" treatment presently exists for CRF. To provide a guide for future research to improve the treatment of CRF, the authors conducted the most comprehensive combined systematic and meta-analytic review of the literature to date on non-pharmacological (psychosocial and exercise) interventions to ameliorate CRF and associated symptoms (vigor/vitality) in adults with cancer, based on 119 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCT studies. Meta-analyses conducted on 57 RCTs indicated that exercise and psychological interventions provided reductions in CRF, with no significant differences between these 2 major types of interventions considered as a whole. Specifically, multimodal exercise and walking programs, restorative approaches, supportive-expressive, and cognitive-behavioral psychosocial interventions show promising potential for ameliorating CRF. The results also suggest that vigor and vitality are distinct phenomena from CRF with regard to responsiveness to intervention. With improved methodological approaches, further research in this area may soon provide clinicians with effective strategies for reducing CRF and enhancing the lives of millions of cancer patients and survivors.

"13";"Music therapy outcome research frequently involves comparisons between groups on continuous scales of psychological constructs. Describing such differences only through statistical tests reduces the existing complexity and creates an artificial and potentially misleading dichotomy. The interpretation of the magnitude of a difference found on a psychological scale is often not straightforward, but can be greatly facilitated and improved by using effect sizes. Cohen's (1988) benchmarks allow for intuitive judgements and enable comparisons between different scales. An example of a study of the effects of music therapy on self-esteem shows how the use of effect sizes can change the interpretation of a research result. Effect sizes have important applications in many fields of music therapy research, including primary studies as well as meta-analyses, and planning of research as well as reporting of research results. Because of their intuitiveness, they may help to bridge the ""gap"" between research and clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)"
"14";"This paper reports results from two meta-analyses of the potential individual-level outcomes of exposure to workplace bullying. After introducing a theoretical framework for the possible relationships between bullying and outcomes, Study 1 summarizes 137 cross-sectional effect sizes from 66 independent samples (N = 77,721). The findings show that exposure to bullying is associated with both job-related and health- and well-being-related outcomes, such as mental and physical health problems, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, burnout, increased intentions to leave, and reduced job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Nonsignificant or weak associations were established for absenteeism, performance, self-perceptions, and sleep. Study 2 examines longitudinal relationships between bullying and mental health and absenteeism, respectively. Based on prospective associations from 13 samples (N = 62,916), workplace bullying influenced mental health problems over time, while baseline mental health problems were associated with a similar increased risk of subsequent reports of exposure to bullying. The long-term effect of exposure to bullying on absenteeism was rather weak. To summarize, the two meta-analyses provide robust evidence for the detrimental effects of workplace bullying that are in line with the theoretical framework presented. The findings have implications for the development of strategies against bullying. Directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

"15";"Introduction: The occurrence of depression during pregnancy is a frequent situation that must be distinguished from postpartum depression. It raises many questions regarding its complications and therapeutic options. Objectives: To provide a systematic review of available data on prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of antepartum depression, as well as on screening tools and treatments currently available. Methods: Studies, reviews, and meta-analyses were searched through the Pubmed and Embase databases. Articles related to postpartum depression or specifically focusing on bipolar disorder were excluded. Results: Epidemiology: Prevalence is estimated between 5 and 15%. Risk factors, in addition to those of any depression, are an ambivalent attitude towards pregnancy, previous miscarriages, and medically-assisted or complicated pregnancies. Diagnosis and screening: No specific tool has yet been designed to diagnose or screen antepartum depression, but some scales (EPDS, PRIME-MD PHQ) have been validated. Adverse outcomes: For the mother, adverse outcomes are those of any depression, in addition to an increased risk of delivery complications and of postpartum depression. For the child, there is an increased risk for preterm birth, low birth-weight, and possibly sudden death. Treatments: Tricyclic antidepressants are widely described as safe during pregnancy. SSRIs show much reassuring data, even though recent studies have raised concerns about cardiac malformations and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Electroconvulsive therapy is only indicated in the most severe cases but appears secure under specific safety measures. Most psychotherapies have not been specifically assessed during pregnancy. Other treatments (bright light therapy, rTMSâ€¦) have shown some promising but not robust results. Conclusion: Antepartum depression is frequent, and potentially severe if not treated. Validation of specific screening tools is warranted. Pharmacological treatment should not be postponed in cases of severe depression. Regarding moderate depressions, it appears reasonable to turn to non-pharmacological treatments, primarily psychotherapies, which therefore should be more thoroughly studied.

"16";"Aim: To determine the effects of computer-based interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in adult populations. Methods: The review was undertaken following standard Cochrane and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance for systematic reviews. The literature was searched until December 2008, with no restrictions on language. Randomized trials with parallel comparator groups were identified in the form of published and unpublished data. Two authors independently screened abstracts and papers for inclusion. Data extraction and bias assessment was undertaken by one author and checked by a second author. Studies that measured total alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking episodes were eligible for inclusion in meta-analyses. A random-effects model was used to pool mean differences. Results: Twenty-four studies were included in the review (19 combined in meta-analyses). The meta-analyses suggested that computer-based interventions were more effective than minimally active comparator groups (e.g. assessment-only) at reducing alcohol consumed per week in student and non-student populations. However, most studies used the mean to summarize skewed data,which could be misleading in small samples. A sensitivity analysis of those studies that used suitable measures of central tendency found that there was no difference between intervention and minimally active comparator groups in alcohol consumed per week by students. Few studies investigated non-student populations or compared interventions with active comparator groups. Conclusion: Computer-based interventions may reduce alcohol consumption compared with assessment-only; the conclusion remains tentative because of methodological weaknesses in the studies. Future research should consider that the distribution of alcohol consumption data is likely to be skewed and that appropriate measures of central tendency are reported.

Methods: Outcomes from 62 meta-analyses of interventions for change in health behavior were quantitatively synthesized, including 1011 primary-level investigations with 599559 participants. Content coding suggested 6 behavioral domains: eating and physical activity, sexual behavior, addictive behaviors, stress management, female-specific screening and intervention behaviors, and behaviors involving use of health services. Results: Behavior change interventions were efficacious (mean effect sizes = 0.08â€“0.45). Behavior change was more evident in more recent metaanalyses; those that sampled older interventions and literatures or sampled more published articles; those that included studies that relied on self-report, used briefer interventions, or sampled fewer, older, or female participants; and in some domains (e.g., stress management) more than others (e.g., sexual behaviors). Conclusions: Interventions improved health-related behaviors; however, efficacy varied as a function of participant and intervention characteristics. This meta-synthesis provides information about the efficacy of behavioral change interventions across health domains and populations; this knowledge can inform the design and development of public health interventions and future meta-analyses of these studies.

"19";"Interventional pain management techniques are considered for patients whose pain proves refractory to conventional treatment. According to the evidence-based medicine (EBM) guidelines, the highest level of evidence for efficacy and safety of a treatment is generated in high-quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. A randomized controlled trial is defined as an experiment that determines the influence of an intervention on the natural history of the disease, which means that the comparative group should receive placebo, which is a sham intervention in case of the interventional pain management techniques. The systematic review summarizes in a structured way the results of the available information. When randomized controlled trials are available, observational studies will often be discarded. As new information on a treatment becomes available the perceived value may change, thus determining the survival time of clinical evidence. This survival time is not different when based on randomized or nonrandomized studies. The inclusion criteria are an important component of the randomized controlled trial and are designed to test a treatment in a homogeneous patient population. As interventional pain management techniques are mainly used for the management of spinal pain, it needs to be stressed that there is no gold standard for the diagnosis. This lack of validated standard diagnostic procedures is at the origin of different patient selection criteria, which makes the interpretation of the different randomized controlled trials and the meta-analyses very difficult. Moreover, the extrapolation of randomized controlled trials with carefully selected patient populations to daily practice is a major problem. Randomized controlled trials in interventional pain management techniques often prove to be underpowered, which can be attributed to the difficulty in motivating patients and the referring physicians to participate in a trial where there is 50% chance of receiving a placebo/sham for intractable pain. Furthermore, the validity of sham intervention as a reflection of the natural course of the disease is questioned. It is stated that any new technique should prove to be at least equally effective as the best available treatment option, which offers the possibility of comparing two groups, both receiving active treatment. The reference treatment may be pharmacological or a rehabilitation program (cognitive behavioral) in which case blinding becomes a problem. It has been demonstrated that large observational studies with a cohort or case-control design do not systematically overestimate the magnitude of the associations between exposure and outcome as compared with the results of randomized controlled trials. There is an urgent need for guidelines on performing prospective cohort trials that should be designed to confirm or refute the anecdotal findings from retrospective studies.

"22";"Dual-task methodology has been increasingly used to assess cognitive motor interference while walking. However, whether the observed dual-task-related gait changes are systematically related to methodological variations remains unclear and researchers still lack knowledge of what cognitive task to use in different groups for clinical purposes or for research. We systematically reviewed experimental studies that measured gait performance with and without performing concurrent cognitive task. Our results suggest that cognitive tasks that involve internal interfering factors seem to disturb gait performance more than those involving external interfering factors. Meta-analysis results show that the overall effect of different cognitive tasks was prominent in gait speed. In healthy participants, meta-regression analysis suggests strong associations between age and speed reduction under dual-task conditions and between the level of cognitive state and speed reduction under dual-task conditions. Standardizing research methodologies, as well as improving their ecological validity, enables better understanding of dual-task-related gait changes in different populations and improves, in turn, our understanding of neural mechanisms and gait control in general in content.

The following article should have been cited as reference 16 instead of the article that is currently cited: Baldwin DS, Cooper JA, Huusom AKT, et al. A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, flexible-dose study to evaluate the tolerability, efficacy and effects of treatment discontinuation with escitalopram and paroxetine in patients with major depressive disorder. Int Clin Psychopharmacol 2006; 21:159-69. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2007-03392-007[/rid]). Objective: Escitalopram is the most selective of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Previous studies have suggested that escitalopram is superior to citalopram in efficacy. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies in which escitalopram was compared with other antidepressants to assess the relative efficacy of these agents. Methods: Data from all randomized, double-blind studies in major depression in which escitalopram was compared with active controls (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine XR [extended release]) were pooled. The 10 studies were conducted in both specialist settings and general practice. Patients met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), for major depressive disorder and were at least 18 years old. In all but 2 studies, patients were required to have a score of 22 or more on the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The primary outcome measure was the estimated difference in treatment effect in MADRS total score at the end of the study. Secondary outcome measures were the response to treatment (defined as a â‰¥ 50% reduction in baseline MADRS total score) and remission rate (defined as MADRS total score â‰¤ 12 at end of study). Results: A total of 2687 patients were included in the analyses (escitalopram n = 1345, conventional SSRIs n = 1102, venlafaxine XR n = 240). Escitalopram was superior to all comparators in overall treatment effect, with an estimated difference in treatment effect of 1.07 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.73, p < 0.01), and in response (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.07-1.56, p < 0.01) and remission (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.46, p < 0.05) rates. In analysis by medication class, escitalopram was significantly superior to the SSRIs and comparable to venlafaxine, although the overall results do not necessarily reflect a significant difference between escitalopram and individual SSRIs. These results were similar in the severely depressed population (patients with baseline MADRS â‰¥ 30). The withdrawal rate due to adverse events was 6.7% for escitalopram compared with 9.1% for the comparators (p < 0.05). Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, escitalopram showed significant superiority in efficacy compared with the active controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
"24";"This paper examines the impact of quality-score weights in meta-analysis. A simulation examines the roles of study characteristics such as population effect size (ES) and its variance on the bias and mean square errors (MSEs) of the estimators for several patterns of relationship between quality and ES, and for specific patterns of systematic deviations related to quality differences. The bias and MSEs of the estimators are large when ESs from low-quality studies deviate from the population ES in specific ways, and bias does not approach zero in these cases. Because meta-analysts can never know whether biases due to quality exist, and because quality weights lead to bias in almost every condition studied, we recommend against the use of quality weights.

"25";"To examine agreement on Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS; Exner, 2004) interpretations, 55 patient protocols were interpreted by 3 to 8 clinicians across 4 data sets on a representative set of 29 characteristics. Substantial reliability was observed across data sets, although a problematic design produced lower results in one. Unexpectedly, a Q-sort task had slightly lower reliability than a simple rating task. As expected, scales that summarized judgments had higher agreement than judgments to individual interpretive statements, and some clinicians produced more generalizable inferences than others. Interpretations for all clinicians were more strongly associated with patients' psychometric true scores (aggregated judgment M range = .82 to .92) than with the judgments of other clinicians (range = .76 to .89). Compared to meta-analyses of interrater reliability in psychology and medicine, the findings indicate these clinicians could reliably interpret Rorschach CS data (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

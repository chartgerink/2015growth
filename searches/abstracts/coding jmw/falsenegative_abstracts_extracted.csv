1,"Parents' ability to make reliable and valid reports about health service utilization is a key research design consideration for studies about the unmet needs of children and adolescents with emotional or behavioral problems. This research report addresses the validity of parents' reports, in particular, parents' rates of false-negative reporting about their children's mental health service use. Findings show that only a few parents of known service users fail to report that their child or adolescent has received services for an emotional or behavioral problem. However, when parents are asked to report about their child's service use with specific providers or in specific service settings, the rate of false-negative reporting tends to increase, and in some circumstances this increase is dramatic. Logistic regression results indicate that false-negative reporting is more likely to occur among parents whose children are male, less frequent service users, or service users whose use is less recent. After controlling for these factors, the authors did not find a significant difference in the rate of false-negative reporting for parents of Anglo and Latino children.

2,"6 cards containing 4 different letters from among the 1st 6 letters of the alphabet were presented serially to 30 Ss. After each card was shown, the experimenter stated whether the card was positive (contained code) or negative. 2 of the statements were false. The S was asked to discover the code and whether he was told the truth. The results showed that S trusted positive and confirming information rather than negative and nonconfirming information.

3,"Background: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and other degenerative parkinsonian syndromes is important for management and prognostic purposes. Diagnosis can be challenging in early disease and in atypical cases. Methods: We reviewed the literature on the application of dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) in degenerative parkinsonism and related disorders as a diagnostic tool. Results: The use of DAT-SPECT shows some utility in the early diagnosis of PD and differentiation from other non-degenerative parkinsonian disorders (i.e. essential tremor, dystonic tremor, drug-induced and in most cases of psychogenic parkinsonism), since it can accurately detect the presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. The test has been shown to have high sensitivity/specificity by multiple studies. DAT imaging may also have some prognostic value for disease progression. However, it has limited value in differentiating among degenerative causes of parkinsonism. DAT imaging has some limitations. In most studies, true test accuracy is unknown since the gold standard is clinical diagnosis by a movement disorders neurologist. Therefore, the sensitivity of the test cannot exceed that of the clinical diagnosis. In addition, false negative scans occur and highlight the need for clinical follow-up. Conclusion: Clinical assessment remains the most important aspect in evaluating these patients. DAT-SPECT is a sensitive modality to detect nigrostriatal degeneration. In spite of increasing data using this technique, however, more long-term clinical studies are required to determine how DAT-SPECT scan can guide decision-making.

4,"Studied false positive and false negative error rates for competency testing in which examinees are permitted to retake the test if they fail to pass. Formulae are provided for the beta-binomial and Rasch models, and estimates based on these 2 models are compared for several typical situations. Although Rasch estimates are expected to be more accurate than beta-binomial estimates, differences among them were not substantial in many practical situations. Under general conditions and when test retaking was permitted, the probability of making a false negative error was zero. Under the same situation, and given that an examinee is a true nonmaster, the conditional probability of making a false positive error for this examinee was one.

5,"Background: There have been many changes in clinical trials methodology since the introduction of lithium and the beginning of the modern era of psychopharmacology in 1949. The nature and importance of these changes have not been fully addressed to date. As methodological flaws in trials can lead to false-negative or false-positive results, the objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of methodological changes in psychopharmacology clinical research over the past 60 years. Methodology/Principal Findings:We performed a systematic review from 1949 to 2009 on MEDLINE and Web of Science electronic databases, and a hand search of high impact journals on studies of seven major drugs (chlorpromazine, clozapine, risperidone, lithium, fluoxetine and lamotrigine). All controlled studies published 100 months after the first trial were included. Ninety-one studies met our inclusion criteria. We analyzed the major changes in abstract reporting, study design, participants’ assessment and enrollment, methodology and statistical analysis. Our results showed that the methodology of psychiatric clinical trials changed substantially, with quality gains in abstract reporting, results reporting, and statistical methodology. Recent trials use more informed consent, periods of washout, intention-to-treat approach and parametric tests. Placebo use remains high and unchanged over time. Conclusions/Significance: Clinical trial quality of psychopharmacological studies has changed significantly in most of the aspects we analyzed. There was significant improvement in quality reporting and internal validity. These changes have increased study efficiency; however, there is room for improvement in some aspects such as rating scales, diagnostic criteria and better trial reporting. Therefore, despite the advancements observed, there are still several areas that can be improved in psychopharmacology clinical trials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

6,"Assessed a talent-search model for identifying high-achieving elementary school students. 2,926 students in Grades 3–6 who had scored at or above the 95th percentile on standardized achievement tests or subtests completed the EXPLORE Test (N. Colangelo et al, 1994), a test designed for Grade 8 students. Subject areas included reading, English, mathematics, and science reasoning. Results show that Ss in Grades 4–6 received EXPLORE scores that were at or higher than Grade 8 norms. Distributed scores were relatively normal or only slightly skewed. Raising the percentile scores requirements on grade-appropriate tests for inclusion in above-level tests would have increased the number of false negatives more than decreasing the number of false positives.

7,"Examined 8–12.5 yr old female children who presented to a hospital emergency room with physical complaints which were later determined to be compelling evidence of sexual abuse. Cases were selected where there was no prior history, suspicion, or disclosure of abuse, and the child failed to disclose any sexual contact in the initial sexual abuse disclosure interview. These interview ""false negatives"" previously had been found to be related to caretaker biases against considering the possibility that abuse may have occurred. However, it was not clear what role, if any, individual psychological processes may have played in the false negative interviews. The present study re-located and assessed a small number of these children for dissociative and behavioral symptoms. Two non-contemporaneous comparison groups were used: (1) ""true-positive"" (i.e., disclosing) sexually abused children from the same hospital emergency room and (2) nonabused, non-psychiatric controls from the same hospital. False negative children were found to have significantly higher levels of dissociative symptoms, although they did not differ from true positives and non-abused controls on general behavioral problems. The results are consistent with an association between false negatives in sexual abuse interviews and dissociation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",0,
8,"Exposed 576 undergraduates to a deception experiment and then gave them 1 of 3 types of awareness questionnaires (indirect, direct, and funnel). Each questionnaire type either included or did not include an orienting paragraph and saliency-control questions. The funnel questionnaire was the most accurate method of assessing awareness; it eliminated the problem of ""false negatives"" remaining in the data, and it did not identify a large number of ""false-positive awares."" The belief that an extended-funnel questionnaire will suggest too much demand characteristic awareness is challenged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",0,
9,"The authors had previously reported a positive association between the intron 7 A218C polymorphism of the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene and bipolar-affective disorder (see record [rid]1997-38630-003[/rid]). Two subsequent studies failed to confirm this finding. Kirov et al (see record [rid]1999-00287-012[/rid]) showed no preferential A218C allele transmission in 118 parent-offspring trios and McQuillin et al (see record [rid]1999-00287-013[/rid]) failed to replicate the initial finding. Various points help to interpret these discrepancies: false-positive and false-negative results may arise in case-control association studies owing to population stratification bias; the linkage disequilibrium between the A218C polymorphism and a pathogenic functional variant in the TPH gene may not exist in the British population; higher frequency of the A allele in French patients in the original study may have caused dissimilar patient samples; the genetic validity of the ""bipolar"" phenotype is unknown, results for patients having attempted suicide reported by Kirov et al suggest that suicidal behavior may be the relevant phenotype. And finally, increasing the number of genetic markers and phenotypes tested in a single population increases the false-positive rate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)",1,
10,"This study investigated whether negative outcomes constrain young children's understanding of false beliefs on morally relevant false belief tasks. Participants (3-6 year-olds, N = 71) were presented with three kinds of morally relevant false belief situations, in which the same false belief accidentally caused morally negative, positive, or neutral outcomes. In addition to identifying an actor's false beliefs, children were asked to evaluate the act itself and to justify their evaluations. The results showed that young children gave fewer correct answers under negative and neutral conditions of morally relevant false belief tasks than they did on standard false belief tasks. Even children who passed the false belief tasks were affected by morally negative outcomes in evaluating the acts, but they gave more intentional reasons to justify their evaluations than did children who did not pass these tasks. These findings suggest that identifying morally relevant false beliefs is a challenge for young children because of their bias against negative outcomes, and also due to the inherent complexity of such situations.

11,"Investigated how hippocampal ibotenic acid lesion affects conditioned fear. Experiments with 16 4-mo-old male mice confirm that extensive lesions localized to the hippocampus impair context-dependent learning but also show that, unlike in previous rat studies, the behavioral impairment is only partial. Furthermore, studying 2 inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) with highly different hippocampal function, it is shown that the presence or absence of a conditioned stimulus during training may influence the mouse's ability to learn complex multiple contextual stimuli in a genotype-dependent manner. It is concluded that performance at the ""context"" test may be based on complex configural (hippocampal) learning but it can also be based on a more simple elemental (non-hippocampal) learning thus leading to potentially false-negative findings in the analysis of hippocampal dysfunction.

12,"It was with great interest that we read a publication by Perry and Condillac (2003) regarding Evidence-based Practices for Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders, specifically the section that refers to the potential uses of screening instruments such as the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test. We performed a short literature search and located a pivotal article by Bryson, Rogers, and Fombonne (2003) which pointed out that very few PDD screens including the PDDST have been subjected to rigorous evaluation of their specificity and sensitivity. Next, we performed an informal content analysis of the PDDST-II and found that a number of the items are prone to confound by ADHD presentation. Lastly, on the basis of the foregoing information, we decided not to screen for PDD at all but to accept all referrals wherein a suspicion of ASD exists (thus eliminating the problem of false negatives).

13,"The theory of reasoned action (TRA) was used to estimate adolescents' vulnerability to inhalant abuse, operationalized by intentions to use or avoid inhalants. The model correctly differentiated 78% of all respondents (N = 596). A second analysis highlighted variables that discriminated properly identified from misclassified youth. False positives, those defined as being at-risk, but who repudiated inhalants, were significantly less likely than their at-risk peers to have used inhalants; they used inhalants and marijuana less frequently; were monitored more closely by parents; and were less rebellious (all p < .05). False negatives, defined as not at-risk, but who had not unequivocally rejected inhalants, were significantly more likely than their similarly classed peers to have used inhalants and marijuana, and to have used both more frequently; also, they were less highly acculturated. This study reaffirmed the utility of the TRA and underscored factors that might improve classification accuracy. This approach may facilitate prevention efforts, and may be extrapolated to any context in which risk categorization is used as a basis for prevention or amelioration.

14,"A cross-linguistic study of the development of answering systems to yes–no questions was conducted, with particular emphasis on the answering systems for negative questions (e.g., ""Wasn't John at the party?""). In English, the answer depends on the underlying affirmative proposition of the question, using a positive/negative (P/N) system, whereas in Korean it depends on the surface form, using an agreement/disagreement (A/D) system. French uses the P/N system for true negative (TN) questions, but a contrapositive form for false negative (FN) questions. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of children between 1 yr 7 mo and 3 yrs 3 mo show that, across the 3 languages, children go through 3 similar developmental stages before they acquire the adult system. Language-specific phenomena include difficulty in using the A/D system for FN questions by Korean children and late acquisition of the contrapositive form by French children. Results suggest that universal cognitive development, pragmatic factors, and language-specific input interact in the development of the question-answering system.

15,"Background: Subjective memory complaints are a requirement in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as they are thought to indicate a decline in objective memory performance. However, recent research suggests that the relationship between subjective memory complaint and objective memory impairment is less clear. Thus, it is possible that many people without subjective memory complaints who develop Alzheimer's disease are precluded from a diagnosis of MCI. Methods: The present study examined the relationship between subjective memory complaint assessed using the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) and objective memory impairment assessed using standard neuropsychological measures in cases of amnestic MCI (n = 48), non-amnestic MCI (n = 27), and unimpaired healthy participants (n = 64). Results: Correlational and regression analyses indicated that subjective memory complaints displayed a poor relationship with objective memory performance. A subsequent discriminant function analysis indicated that subjective memory complaints failed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MCI and resulted in increased rates of false negative and false positive diagnoses. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that a diagnostic criterion of subjective memory complaint reduces the accuracy of MCI diagnosis, resulting in an elevated rate of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The results of this study in conjunction with recent research indicate that a criterion of subjective memory complaint should be discarded from emerging diagnostic criteria for MCI.

16,"Comments on an article by S. A. Meda et al. (see record [rid]2012-06484-001[/rid]). Meda et al. have reported an interesting and technically advanced study that seeks to explore the relationships between species of psychosis at the level of brain systems or networks. In doing so, they carry forward another seminal concept that has been in the background of psychiatry since the 19th century: the idea, arguably originating with Meynert and Wernicke, that psychotic disorders arise from a disruption of connections between different brain regions. In their study, Meda et al. measured brain functional networks using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample comprising patients with bipolar disorder, patients with schizophrenia, the first-degree relatives of both patient groups, and healthy volunteers. This was a relatively large and carefully characterized sample for an fMRI-based investigation, which is one of the fundamental strengths of the study. The resting state fMRI measurements from each participant were first analyzed using independent component analysis to define 16 large-scale brain networks, so-called resting state networks (RSNs). On this basis, Meda et al. explored differences of Internetwork coupling in the relatives compared with healthy volunteers, predicting that if the network abnormalities in patients were markers of genetic risk, they should be evident also in the first-degree relatives of patients. This prediction was partly supported by the data: the relatives of patients with bipolar disorder showed abnormalities of between-network connectivity that largely overlapped with the profile seen in bipolar patients. However, there were no significant abnormalities of network organization demonstrated in the relatives of patients with schizophrenia. The study by Meda et al. is an important proof of principle. It demonstrates the utility and feasibility of using resting state fMRI measurements to find diagnostically cross-cutting biomarkers that represent commonality of brain disorganization across nosologically distinct species of disorder. It thus stands as an example of the ambition to progressively refine and enrich, possibly to reconstruct, diagnostic systems in psychiatry by making greater use of biological data. Sample composition and sample size are always important considerations. The study by Meda et al. is unusually large and carefully composed, certainly by the general standard of fMRI research in psychiatry. But it remains possible that some of the negative results, such as the lack of abnormality of network metrics in the relatives of people with schizophrenia, could be false-negative or type 2 errors. If we want functional neuroimaging to advance to the point of being able to reconstruct long-established diagnostic frameworks or to provide endophenotypes that might be the targets of genetic association analysis, we will need larger, epidemiologically principled samples whose collection will entail coordination across multiple clinical research groups.

17,"Comments on an article by Steffi Sachse and Waldemar Von Suchodoletz (see record [rid]2008-02542-005[/rid]). The study by Sachse and Von Suchodoletz compares the accuracy and diagnostic power of 2 diagnostic tests for early identification of language delay: a parent report measure (ELFRA-2) and direct language assessment (SETK-2). In our view, the approach taken for calculating diagnostic measures should be viewed critically. This problem arises from the calculation of diagnostic measures on the basis of a subsample of ELFRA-2-negative children. Extracting only a subsample is understandable for cost reasons. However, if not all children with negative index test results are verified by the reference standard this may result in an overestimation of sensitivity, as not all children with false-negative results will be detected.

18,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the workhorse of imaging-based human cognitive neuroscience. The use of fMRI is ever-increasing; within the last 4 years more fMRI studies have been published than in the previous 17 years. This large body of research has mainly focused on the functional localization of condition- or stimulus-dependent changes in the blood-oxygenation-level dependent signal. In recent years, however, many aspects of the commonly practiced analysis frameworks and methodologies have been critically reassessed. Here we summarize these critiques, providing an overview of the major conceptual and practical deficiencies in widely used brain-mapping approaches, and exemplify some of these issues by the use of imaging data and simulations. In particular, we discuss the inherent pitfalls and shortcomings of methodologies for statistical parametric mapping. Our critique emphasizes recent reports of excessively high numbers of both false positive and false negative findings in fMRI brain mapping. We outline our view regarding the broader scientific implications of these methodological considerations and briefly discuss possible solutions.

19,"The effects of mood on false memories have not been studied systematically until recently. Some results seem to indicate that negative mood may reduce false recall and thus suggest an influence of emotional valence on false memory. The present research tested the effects of both valence and arousal on recall and recognition and indicates that the effect is actually due to arousal. In fact, whether participants' mood is positive, negative, or neutral, false memories are significantly more frequent under conditions of high arousal than under conditions of low arousal.

20,"Administered the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) of E. M. Bernstein and F. W. Putnam (see record [rid]1987-14407-001[/rid]) to 259 college students, 33 patients with multiple personality disorder (MPD), and 29 patients with a dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS). The interrater reliability for the DES scoring procedure was excellent. The test–retest reliability of DES scores was also excellent, which suggests that DES total scores are temporally stable and similar in absolute value across testings. The internal consistency of DES scores was very high. Both MPD and DDNOS Ss earned significantly higher DES scores than did students. MPD Ss earned significantly higher DES scores than DDNOS Ss. A DES cut-off score of 45–55 will maximize the probability of correctly classifying normal Ss from dissociative disorder patients while minimizing the rates of false positive and false negative errors.

21,"Introduction: We aimed to field-test the beta version of the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3 beta) diagnostic criteria for classical trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The proposed beta draft of the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11 beta) is almost exclusively based on the ICHD-3 beta classification structure although slightly abbreviated. We compared sensitivity and specificity to ICHD-2 criteria, and evaluated the needs for revision. Methods: Clinical characteristics were systematically and prospectively collected from 206 consecutive TN patients and from 37 consecutive patients with persistent idiopathic facial pain in a cross-sectional study design. Results: The specificity of ICHD-3 beta was similar to ICHD-2 (97.3% vs. 89.2%, p = 0.248) and the sensitivity was unchanged (76.2% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.134). The majority of false-negative diagnoses in TN patients were due to sensory abnormalities at clinical examination. With a proposed modified version of ICHD-3 beta it was possible to increase sensitivity to 96.1% (p < 0.001 compared to ICHD-3 beta) while maintaining specificity at 83.8% (p = 0.074 compared to ICHD-3 beta). Conclusion: ICHD-3 beta was not significantly different from ICHD-2 and both lacked sensitivity. A modification of the criteria improved the sensitivity greatly and is proposed for inclusion in the forthcoming ICHD-3. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

22,"In the staircase test, a naive mouse is placed in a Plexiglas chamber containing a 5-step staircase, and the number of rearings and steps climbed are recorded for 3 min. A claim for drug-class specificity has been made because conventional anxiolytics reduced rearings at doses that did not reduce steps climbed, while nonanxiolytics affected both measures in parallel. In the present study, using male CD-1 mice, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol, alprazolam, meprobamate, buspirone, CGS 9896, ketanserine, tracazolate, phencyclidine, nicotine, morphine, phenacetin, pentylenetetrazol, and FG 7142 were tested using the staircase paradigm. Results indicate an equivocal false negative for alprazolam, a clear false negative for buspirone, and a clear false positive for morphine. It is concluded that the staircase test lacks the degree of therapeutic-class specificity previously proposed but may still be useful in basic research.

23,"Social-learning models of drug motivation and relapse often include the constructs of affect and drug expectancies. Most research has taken a molar approach to examining relations between these constructs and level of drug use. An experiment examined the roles of affect and expectancies in multiple measures of situation-specific motivation to smoke tobacco. Undergraduate smokers (n = 101) received either a positive or negative mood manipulation (false feedback on an intelligence test). Self-reported urge was influenced by both negative affect and expectancies for positive reinforcement from smoking. Actual consumption was related only to smoking expectancies and only among abstaining smokers. affect by expectancy interactions were also found. Findings support a limited role of affect and expectancies in smoking motivation. Poor coherence among the motivational indexes challenges the assumptions of existing models of drug motivation.

24,"Describes the properties that allow the identification of innuendo and stresses that this identification is concerned with the pragmatics of utterance interpretation rather than the cognitive mechanisms of information processing. Innuendoes most often arise at critical junctures of interaction which require speakers to act in order to influence others yet to conceal their intentions in order to avoid the risks that would be involved in their overt expression. Innuendoes may be venomous or non-venomous depending on their aim. The author defines venomous innuendo as a non-overt intentional negative ascription, whether true or false, usually in the form of an implicature, which is understood as a charge against what is, for the most part, a non-present party. The use of innuendo as a means of attacking a target is the result of a calculation of the risks of explication together with the benefits of implication. Non-venomous innuendo, especially in the form of sexual innuendo, is also examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",0,
25,"62 children (aged 5–8 yrs) and 12 adults (aged 21–28 yrs) participated in a test of the belief that visual sensitivity improves substantially during childhood. Age-related change in visual sensitivity is generally attributed to maturation of the retino-striate pathways; the present study evaluated the extent to which attentional factors emphasize the effect of age. After familiarization, sensitivity was assessed at 2 locations in the superior temporal field using a bracketing technique. False-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) catch-trials were interspersed with the sequence of stimuli. Age affected sensitivity, and the general level of attentiveness varied not only with age, but also among Ss in the same age group. The extent to which improved visual sensitivity may reflect a concomitant evolution of vigilance was then estimated. Factors for evaluating attentiveness (rate of FN responses, slope of the psychometric function at the median, and goodness of fit) were much better predictors of sensitivity than was age. More significantly, the grouping of Ss into homogeneous subgroups on the basis of their attentional performance showed that children as young as 5 yrs may have a visual sensitivity that is only marginally lower than that of adults.

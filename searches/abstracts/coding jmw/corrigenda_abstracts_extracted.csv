Ochs, Andrea Herzka and Ilker Yaylali (The Neurodiagnostic Journal, 2012[Dec], Vol 52[4], 312-319). In the original article, Figure 3 and Figure 5 are incorrectly placed. Figure 3 should be the data in Figure 5 and Figure 5 should be the data in Figure 3. The figure labels are correct. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-35119-002[/rid]). Arthroscopic hip surgery is used to treat many of the causes of hip pain, hip instability, and hip disorders. Hip pain and instability are often caused by injuries to the acetabular labrum. Repairing labral tears, suturing, and debridement involve stabilizing the hip and placing the operative side leg in traction (Phillipon 2006, Phillipon and Schenker 2006) to allow for instrument clearance and to avoid iatrogenic injury to the chondral surfaces. This places the sciatic nerve in a stretched position and may cause temporary or permanent nerve injury. Transient neuropraxia is the most common injury occurring in 5% of the patients undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery (McCarthy and Lee 2006). 35 patients; 24 women and 11 men, (a total of 36 surgeries) were monitored with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring using somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) during hip arthroscopy for labral repair and femoral head osteoplasty. They ranged in age from 15 to 59 years; mean age: 39.81 years. During surgery 19 (54%) patients experienced significant SSEP waveform changes. Time from placement of traction to loss of signals in those patients experiencing SSEP changes ranged from 7 minutes to 46 minutes. Recovery of SSEP signals ranged from 2 minutes to over 15 minutes when the traction of the leg was released. Surgeries ranged from 2 to 4 hours; mean: 2.78 hours. These findings show that neuromonitoring during hip arthroscopic labral repair and debridement procedures might be useful to prevent temporary and permanent neural tissue injuries.

3,"Reports an error in the original article by Michael A. Burman, Mark J. Starr, and Jonathan C. Gewirtz (Hippocampus, 2006, Vol 16(2), 103-113). An error occurred in the content of the article ""Dissociable Effects of Hippocampus Lesions on Expression of Fear and Trace Fear Conditioning Memories in Rats,"". The corrected content is given in the present article. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2006-02627-001[/rid]). The role of the hippocampus in memory is commonly investigated by comparing fear conditioning paradigms that differ in their reliance on the hippocampus. For example, the dorsal (septal) portion of the hippocampus is involved in trace, but not delay fear conditioning, two Pavlovian paradigms in which only the relative timing of stimulus presentation is varied. However, a growing literature implicates the ventral (temporal) portion of the hippocampus in the expression of fear, irrespective of prior training. The current experiments evaluated the relative contributions of the dorsal and ventral portions of the hippocampus to trace fear conditioning specifically vs. the expression of conditioned fear in general. Lesions restricted to the dorsal hippocampus blocked acquisition of trace fear conditioning. Larger lesions, also including an adjacent portion of the ventral hippocampus, were required to impair retrieval of trace fear conditioning. Delay fear conditioning was not disrupted in either case. In contrast, lesions that encompassed almost the entire dorsal and ventral hippocampus disrupted expression of both trace and delay fear conditioning. The current data suggest distinct roles in fear conditioning for three regions of the hippocampus: the septal zone is required for acquisition of trace fear conditioning, a larger portion of the hippocampus is critical for memory retrieval, and a region including the temporal zone is required for expression of both trace and delay fear conditioning. These findings are consistent with evidence suggesting the neuroanatomical and functional segregation of the hippocampus into three zones along its septal-temporal axis, (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",1

Each S received 3 different playbacks: degraded (unaltered), reverberated, and high-frequency attenuated song. Results show that male Carolina wrens can use either temporal or spectral characteristics for ranging song types which they were unlikely to have heard previously. Playbacks consisting of only one song prevented Ss' close range experience with the loudspeaker, and flights beyond the loudspeaker provided direct evidence for over-assessment of distance when songs were degradedâ€¦ (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",1

We examined the relationship between group boundary spanners' work group identification and effective (i.e., harmonious and productive) intergroup relations in 53 work groups in five health care organizations. The data suggest this relationship was moderated by boundary spanners' levels of organizational identification, thus supporting a dual identity model. Limited support was found for the moderating effect of intergroup contact. Finally, if boundary spanners displayed frequent intergroup contact and identified highly with their organization, group identification was most strongly related to effective intergroup relations.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-09639-010[/rid]). Background: Prolonged fatigue can cause physical, mental and occupational disability. Fatigue often persists because of a combination of biopsychosocial factors. Purpose: To evaluate the process and outcomes of three existing outpatient vocational rehabilitation interventions (VRI) in patients with prolonged fatigue complaints. The VRIs differ with regard to the content and treatment duration, enrolment procedure and financing. Method: A pre-post design was used with repeated measurements before treatment, after treatment and 3 months after treatment. Primary outcomes (fatigue and work participation) and secondary outcomes (physical and social functioning, mental health and physiological indicators (heart rate variability)) were assessed over time using linear mixed models analysis. A process evaluation (i.e. patient reach, content completeness and patient satisfaction) was conducted as well. Results: One hundred patients participated. Post-treatment, fatigue decreased (p < .001) and work participation (p < .010), physical functioning (p < .001) and mental health (p < .001) improved considerably in all three VRIs. Social functioning improved in one VRI (p = .022), but did not in the other two (p = .442, p = .196, respectively). Physiologically, heart rate variability improved in two VRIs (p = .044, p = .038, respectively). VRIs were administered according to the programme protocol. Almost all patients met their personal goals and the majority was satisfied with the outcomes of diminished constraints at work. Conclusion: Three VRIs showed significant and clinically relevant outcomes over time regarding decreased fatigue and improved functioning and work participation in fatigued patients. The VRIs administered patient-tailored biopsychosocial interventions as planned and patients were satisfied with the interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",1

The publisher regrets that in Table 1 of the initially published article, the Min residential deprivation score for the Trade school/CEGEP group should read â€“0.121 instead of 0.121.] The focus, in place and health research, on a single, residential, context overlooks the fact that individuals are mobile and experience other settings in the course of their daily activities. Socio-economic characteristics are associated with activity patterns, as well as with the quality of places where certain groups conduct activities, i.e. their non-residential activity space. Examining how measures of exposure to resources, and inequalities thereof, compare between residential and non-residential contexts is required. Baseline data from 1890 young adults (18â€“25 years-old) participating in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking, Montreal, Canada (2011â€“2012), were analyzed. Socio-demographic and activity location data were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Area-level material deprivation was measured within 500-m road-network buffer zones around participants' residential and activity locations. Deprivation scores in the residential area and non-residential activity space were compared between social groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate associations between individual- and area-level characteristics and non-residential activity space deprivation, and to explore whether these characteristics attenuated the educationâ€“deprivation association. Participants in low educational categories lived and conducted activities in more disadvantaged areas than university students/graduates. Educational inequalities in exposure to area-level deprivation were larger in the non-residential activity space than in the residential area for the least educated, but smaller for the intermediate group. Adjusting for selected covariates such as transportation resources and residential deprivation did not significantly attenuate the educationâ€“deprivation associations. Results support the existence of social isolation in residential areas and activity locations, whereby less educated individuals tend to be confined to more disadvantaged areas than their more educated counterparts. They also highlight the relevance of investigating both residential and non-residential contexts when studying inequalities in health-relevant exposures.

The authors now publish the entire SUMMARY as first intended in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-01067-012[/rid]). Background: A previous paper began with a critical review of current models and measures of quality of life and then proposed criteria for judging the relative merits of alternative models: preference was given to finding a model with explicit mechanisms, linkages to a science base, a means of identifying deficits amenable to rational restorative interventions, and with embedded values of the whole person. A conjectured model, based on the processes of accessing choices and choosing among them, matched the proposed criteria. The choices and choosing (c-c) process is an evolved adaptive mechanism dedicated to the pursuit of quality of life, driven by specific biological and psychological systems, and influenced also by social and environmental forces. Objective: In this paper the c-c model is examined for its potential to strengthen the science base for the field of quality of life and thus to unify many approaches to concept and measurement. Conclusions: A third paper in this set will lay out a guide to applying the c-c model in evaluating impairments of quality of life and will tie this evaluation to corresponding interventions aimed at relieving restrictions or distortions of the c-c process; thus helping people to preserve and improve their quality of life. The fourth paper will demonstrate empirical analyses of the relationship between health imposed restrictions of options for living and conventional indicators of diminished quality of life.

Based on the assumption that toxicant yields per mg nicotine were independent of smoking intensity, the minimum degree of nicotine compensation necessary to obtain equal or greater dosages of these toxic compounds from the lower-tar cigarette ranged from 0% to 73%. A smoker who compensates only incompletely for nicotine may thus obtain a higher dosage of a specific smoke toxicant from a lower-tar cigarette than from a higher-tar cigarette.

The present investigation tested the relations between the Big Five dimensions of personality and the marital relationships of over 400 couples using both observational and questionnaire data. Four major findings emerged from these analyses. First, self-reports of neuroticism were positively correlated with negative interactions and negatively correlated with global evaluations of the marriage. Second, self-reports of agreeableness were negatively correlated with negative interactions and generally positively correlated with global evaluations of the marriage. Third, self-reports of openness were negatively correlated with observer reports of negative interactions. Fourth, self-reports of openness by wives were positively correlated with global reports of sexual satisfaction. These findings suggest that agreeableness and openness deserve increased attention as significant correlates of close relationships.

During last decades new methods of auditory augmentation had been developed with movement sonification as one of the most recent approaches expanding auditory movement information also to usually mute phases of movement. Despite general evidence on the effectiveness of movement sonification in different fields of applied research there is nearly no empirical proof on how sonification of gross motor human movement should be configured to achieve information rich sound sequences. Such lack of empirical proof is given for (a) the selection of suitable movement features as well as for (b) effective kinetic-acoustical mapping patterns and for (c) the number of regarded dimensions of sonification. In this study we explore the informational content of artificial acoustical kinematics in terms of a kinematic movement sonification using an intermodal discrimination paradigm. In a repeated measure design we analysed discrimination rates of six everyday upper limb actions to evaluate the effectiveness of seven different kinds of kinematic-acoustical mappings as well as short term learning effects. The kinematics of the upper limb actions were calculated based on inertial motion sensor data and transformed into seven different sonifications. Sound sequences were randomly presented to participants and discrimination rates as well as confidence of choice were analysed. Data indicate an instantaneous comprehensibility of the artificial movement acoustics as well as short term learning effects. No differences between different dimensional encodings became evident thus indicating a high efficiency for intermodal pattern discrimination for the acoustically coded velocity distribution of the actions. Taken together movement information related to continuous kinematic parameters can be transformed into the auditory domain. Additionally, pattern based action discrimination is obviously not restricted to the visual modality. Artificial acoustical kinematics might be used to supplement and/or substitute visual motion perception in sports and motor rehabilitation.

24,"Reports an error in the article by M. Baggaley (Psychological Bulletin, 1998[Mar], 22[3], 153â€“154). On page 154, the author states that officers have 5-figure service numbers; the correct number is 6. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2000-03460-007[/rid]). 13% of referrals of ex-servicemen to a military psychiatric center for the treatment of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a 12-mo period have proven to be factitious. A simple classification of factitious combat-related PTSD into those with no military service and those with military service but with false claims of combat is described. The possible causes of this behavior are discussed, including possible financial gain, benefits of the sick role, improvement of self-esteem, or mistaken attribution of present psychiatric disorders to past military service. A guide to the detection of factitious claims for psychiatrists without military experience is given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)",1

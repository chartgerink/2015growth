1,"Comments on an article by J. L. McClelland et al. (see record [rid]2010-16091-010[/rid]) and T. L. Griffiths et al. (see record [rid]2010-16091-011[/rid]). Griffiths et al. and McClelland et al. one cannot help but think of the old parable about the blind men and the elephant: each essay offers true and interesting insights into the mind, yet each seems ultimately incomplete. Of the two,Griffiths et al. seem to come closer to offering a satisfying approach. Theirs is currently a robust, active research program, whereas progress in connectionism has slowed considerably in recent years. In the final analysis, contemporary connectionist and Bayesian approaches only scratch the surface of cognitive possibility. Genuinely adequate theories must borrow from each of these traditions the emphasis of connectionism on development, and on how complex cognition derives from the actions of relatively simple low-level units; Bayes' emphasis on reverse engineering.

2,"Personnel psychologists have traditionally believed that employment test validities are situation specific. This study presents a Bayesian statistical model that is based on the alternate hypothesis that variation in validity outcomes from study to study for similar jobs and tests is artifactual in nature. Certain outcomes using this model permit validity generalization to new settings without carrying out a validation study of any kind. Where such generalization is not justified, the procedure is considered to provide an improved method of data analysis and decision making for the necessary situational validity study. Application to 4 distributions of empirical validity coefficients is presented to demonstrate the power of the model. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",1
3,"A multiple hypothesis problem with directional alternatives is considered in a decision theoretic framework. Skewness in the alternatives is considered, and it is shown that this skewness permits the Bayes rules to possess certain advantages when one direction of the alternatives is more important or more probable than the other direction. Bayes rules subject to constraints on certain directional false discovery rates are obtained, and their performances are compared with a traditional FDR rule through simulation. We also analyzed a gene expression data using our methodology, and compare the results to that of a FDR method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)",1
4,"Recent research advocates the use of count models with random parameters as an alternative method for analyzing accident frequencies. In this paper a dataset composed of urban arterials in Vancouver, British Columbia, is considered where the 392 segments were clustered into 58 corridors. The main objective is to assess the corridor effects with alternate specifications. The proposed models were estimated in a Full Bayes context via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and were compared in terms of their goodness of fit and inference. A variety of covariates were found to significantly influence accident frequencies. However, these covariates resulted in random parameters and thereby their effects on accident frequency were found to vary significantly across corridors. Further, a Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model with random parameters for each corridor provided the best fit. Apart from the improvement in goodness of fit, such an approach is useful in gaining new insights into how accident frequencies are influenced by the covariates, and in accounting for heterogeneity due to unobserved road geometrics, traffic characteristics, environmental factors and driver behavior. The inclusion of corridor effects in the mean function could also explain enough variation that some of the model covariates would be rendered non-significant and thereby affecting model inference.

5,"Computational neuroscience has uncovered a number of computational principles used by nervous systems. At the same time, neuromorphic hardware has matured to a state where fast silicon implementations of complex neural networks have become feasible. En route to future technical applications of neuromorphic computing the current challenge lies in the identification and implementation of functional brain algorithms. Taking inspiration from the olfactory system of insects, we constructed a spiking neural network for the classification of multivariate data, a common problem in signal and data analysis. In this model, real-valued multivariate data are converted into spike trains using â€œvirtual receptorsâ€<U+FFFD> (VRs). Their output is processed by lateral inhibition and drives a winner-take-all circuit that supports supervised learning. VRs are conveniently implemented in software, whereas the lateral inhibition and classification stages run on accelerated neuromorphic hardware. When trained and tested on real-world datasets, we find that the classification performance is on par with a naÃ¯ve Bayes classifier. An analysis of the network dynamics shows that stable decisions in output neuron populations are reached within less than 100 ms of biological time, matching the time-to-decision reported for the insect nervous system. Through leveraging a population code, the network tolerates the variability of neuronal transfer functions and trial-to-trial variation that is inevitably present on the hardware system. Our work provides a proof of principle for the successful implementation of a functional spiking neural network on a configurable neuromorphic hardware system that can readily be applied to real-world computing problems.

6,"Background: Many persons dying of cancer enroll in home-based hospice prior to death. It is established in the literature that persons in rural settings are less likely to use hospice than persons living in urban areas. We examine whether this is due, in part, to a lack of hospice providers serving rural areas. Methods: The 100% Medicare enrollment and hospice files for 2000-2002 were the basis for this study. We used a Bayesian smoothing technique to estimate the ZIP-code-level service area for each Medicare-certified hospice in the United States. These service areas were combined to identify ZIP codes not served by any hospice. Results: Overall, approximately 332,000 elders (7.5% of ZIP codes) reside in areas not served by home-based hospice. Each year over 15,000 deaths occur in these unserved areas. There was a strong association between lack of service and urban/rural gradient. One hundred percent of the ZIP codes in the most urban areas (>1,000,000 people) are served by hospice and only 2.8% of the ZIP codes in urban areas of less than 1,000,000 are unserved. In rural areas adjacent to urban areas, over 9% of ZIP codes are unserved and in rural areas not adjacent to an urban area almost 24% of ZIP codes are not served by hospice. Conclusions: While the majority of the elderly population of the US resides in areas currently served by Medicare-certified hospice, there is a geographically large area that lacks home-based hospice services. Current payment policies may need to be adjusted to facilitate hospice availability to these rural populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)",1
7,"Within Bayesian estimation, prior distributions are placed on model parameters and these distributions can take on many different levels of informativeness. Although much of the research conducted within this estimation framework uses what are called diffuse (or noninformative) priors, there are certain models and modeling circumstances where it is more optimal to use what are referred to as informative priors. This study focuses on the latter situation and examines the effects of inaccurate informative priors on the growth parameters within the context of growth mixture modeling. Overall, results indicated that growth mixture modeling is relatively robust to the use of inaccurate mean hyperparameters for the growth parameters, as long as the variance hyperparameters are somewhat large.

8,"Conducted an investigation into the use of Bayesian learning of the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian mixture density. In a framework of the continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM), Bayesian learning serves as a unified approach for parameter smoothing, speaker adaptation, speaker clustering, and corrective training. The goal was to enhance model robustness in a CDHMM-based speech recognition system so as to improve performance. The theoretical basis for this procedure is presented, and results applying it to parameter smoothing, speaker adaptation, speaker clustering, and corrective training are given. Sex-dependent modeling is also addressed. (French & German abstracts) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)",1
9,"Analyzes, statistically, the psychological stress normally associated with a waiting situation and describes this reaction as the result of a building-up process starting at the beginning of the waiting period and sometimes even before. Analysis of the process supported the hypothesis that the resulting stress could be explained by the sense of waste the individual associates with the time spent in waiting and by the uncertainty he/she may have about the remaining waiting time. It is proved that, under general conditions, the resulting psychological stress accumulated during the process is a marginal increasing function of the waiting time. It is shown that the total psychological cost for the whole waiting period could be cut down by providing the individual with real time information about when he/she would be served, and some optimal policies for informing the waiting individual are derived. The same pattern of results was obtained considering both Bayesian and non-Bayesian behavior of the individual during the waiting process, and the case of Bayesian behavior is appended.

10,"Extreme learning machine (ELM) has shown its good performance in regression applications with a very fast speed. But there is still a difficulty to compromise between better generalization performance and smaller complexity of the ELM (a number of hidden nodes). This paper proposes a method called Delta Test-ELM (DT-ELM), which operates in an incremental way to create less complex ELM structures and determines the number of hidden nodes automatically. It uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as well as Delta Test (DT) to restrict the search as well as to consider the size of the network and prevent overfitting. Moreover, ensemble modeling is used on different DT-ELM models and it shows good test results in Experiments section. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

11,"The usage of Statistics as a tool to investigate scientific hypotheses is a universal practice in Social Sciences. Because of that, we usually apply numerous methods with the objective of guiding the data analyses, whose main difficulty is the correct interpretation of the results derivate from them. In accordance with the American Psychological Association, the simpler the method used the better if its assumptions allow us to apply such method to our data. However, it is also convenient to know the potential of different alternatives to analyse our data, like the Bayes empiric method. In this paper, we set out some elements usually involved in the statistical modelling from the Bayesian perspective: the ""a priori"" distribution concept, its transformation in an ""a posteriori"" distribution, and the inferences related to the estimation and contrast of hypotheses about the proportion of successes in a Binomial model.

12,"A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a probabilistic network that models interdependent entities that change over time. Given example sequences of multivariate data, we use a genetic algorithm to synthesize a network structure that models the causal relationships that explain the sequence. We use a multi-objective evaluation strategy with a genetic algorithm. The multi-objective criteria are a network's probabilistic score and structural complexity score. Our use of Pareto ranking is ideal for this application, because it naturally balances the effect of the likelihood and structural simplicity terms used in the BIC network evaluation heuristic. We use a basic structural scoring formula, which tries to keep the number of links in the network approximately equivalent to the number of variables. We also use a simple representation that favors sparsely connected networks similar in structure to those modeling biological phenomenon. Our experiments show promising results when evolving networks ranging from 10 to 30 variables, using a maximal connectivity of between 3 and 4 parents per node. The results from the multi-objective GA were superior to those obtained with a single objective GA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)",1
13,"Gaze behaviour is known to indicate information gathering. It is therefore suggested that it could be used to derive information about the driver's next planned objective in order to identify intended manoeuvres without relying solely on car data. Ultimately this would be practically realised by an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) using gaze data to correctly infer the intentions of the driver from what is implied by the incoming gaze data available to it. Neural Networks' ability to approximate arbitrary functions from observed data therefore makes them a candidate for modelling driver intent. Previous work has shown that significantly distinct gaze patterns precede each of the driving manoeuvres analysed indicating that eye movement data might be used as input to ADAS supplementing sensors, such as CAN-Bus (Controller Area Network), laser, radar or LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) in order to recognise intended driving manoeuvres. In this study, drivers' gaze behaviour was measured prior to and during the execution of different driving manoeuvres performed in a dynamic driving simulator. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), and Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs) were then trained using gaze data to act as classifiers that predict the occurrence of certain driving manoeuvres. This has previously been successfully demonstrated with real traffic data [1]. Issues considered here included the amount of data that is used for predictive purposes prior to the manoeuvre, the accuracy of the predictive models at different times prior to the manoeuvre taking place and the relative difficulty of predicting a lane change left manoeuvre against predicting a lane change right manoeuvre.

14,"Correlation coefficients play a key role in the social and behavioral sciences for quantifying the degree of linear association between variables. A Bayes factor is proposed that allows researchers to test hypotheses with order constraints on correlation coefficients in a direct manner. This Bayes factor balances between fit and complexity of order-constrained hypotheses in a natural way. A diffuse prior on the correlation matrix is used that minimizes prior shrinkage and results in most evidence for an order-constrained hypothesis that is supported by the data. An efficient method is proposed for the computation of the Bayes factor. A key aspect in the computation is a Fisher Z transformation on the posterior distribution of the correlations such that an approximately normal distribution is obtained. The methodology is implemented in a freely downloadable software program called â€œBOCORâ€<U+FFFD>. The methods are applied to a multitraitâ€“multimethod analysis, a repeated measures study, and a study on directed moderator effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

15,"When applicable, an assumed monotonicity property of the regression function w.r.t. covariates has a strong stabilizing effect on the estimates. Because of this, other parametric or structural assumptions may not be needed at all. Although monotonic regression in one dimension is well studied, the question remains whether one can find computationally feasible generalizations to multiple dimensions. Here, we propose a nonâ€<U+FFFD>parametric monotonic regression model for one or more covariates and a Bayesian estimation procedure. The monotonic construction is based on marked point processes, where the random point locations and the associated marks (function levels) together form piecewise constant realizations of the regression surfaces. The actual inference is based on modelâ€<U+FFFD>averaged results over the realizations. The monotonicity of the construction is enforced by partial ordering constraints, which allows it to asymptotically, with increasing density of support points, approximate the family of all monotonic bounded continuous functions.

16,"Hierarchical and empirical Bayes approaches to inference are attractive for data arising from microarray gene expression studies because of their ability to borrow strength across genes in making inferences. Here we focus on the simplest case where we have data from replicated two colour arrays which compare two samples and where we wish to decide which genes are differentially expressed and obtain estimates of operating characteristics such as false discovery rates. The purpose of this paper is to examine the frequentist performance of Bayesian variable selection approaches to this problem for different prior specifications and to examine the effect on inference of commonly used empirical Bayes approximations to hierarchical Bayes procedures. The paper makes three main contributions. First, we describe how the log odds of differential expression can usually be computed analytically in the case where a double tailed exponential prior is used for gene effects rather than a normal prior, which gives an alternative to the commonly used B-statistic for ranking genes in simple comparative experiments. The second contribution of the paper is to compare empirical Bayes procedures for detecting differential expression with hierarchical Bayes methods which account for uncertainty in prior hyperparameters to examine how much is lost in using the commonly employed empirical Bayes approximations. Third, we describe an efficient MCMC scheme for carrying out the computations required for the hierarchical Bayes procedures. Comparisons are made via simulation studies where the simulated data are obtained by fitting models to some real microarray data sets. The results have implications for analysis of microarray data using parametric hierarchical and empirical Bayes methods for more complex experimental designs: generally we find that the empirical Bayes methods work well, which supports their use in the analysis of more complex experiments when a full hierarchical Bayes analysis would impose heavy computational demands.

17,"Comments on an article by Saurav Chatterjee et al. (see record [rid]2014-00328-004[/rid]). Chatterjee et al. reported pooled analyses of 6 randomized trials testing different direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation using frequentist and Bayesian random-effect models. They demonstrated that the risk of intracranial hemorrhage is halved with DOACs compared with control and, based on indirect comparisons, suggest that there are no important differences between the DOACs. The evidence presented by Chatterjee et al. for a reduction in intracranial hemorrhage with the DOACs compared with control is convincing and welcome for patients, but the authors believe that their conclusion that DOACs are similar should be interpreted with caution. Indirect comparisons are potentially misleading because they can be affected by differences among the studies in the types of patients included, co-interventions, and outcomes. A single estimate of the relative risk of intracranial hemorrhage comparing all DOACs with all comparators is an oversimplification. Intriguingly, intracerebral hemorrhage and subdural hematomas are both sharply reduced by DOACs relative to warfarin and these represent different types of vessel rupture.

18,"There is much interest currently in using functional neuroimaging techniques to understand better the nature of cognition. One particular practice that has become common is 'reverse inference', by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak.

19,"Despite widespread recognition of operating speed as a key safety-related variable for roundabouts, there is no consensus on the best models for capturing the relationship between crashes and speed, or, for that matter, on how speed can be estimated in situations where it cannot be observed (such as when a roundabout is being designed or redesigned). This paper uses US and Italian roundabout approach-level data to investigate models relating safety to various measures of predicted speed. This is an indirect approach for developing safety models for estimating the effects of design features, the premise being that these features can better predict speed, which, in turn, can be used as a predictor of crash frequency. After exploring various possibilities, the approach average speed (AAS)â€”defined as the average of entry, upstream circulating and exiting speeds in this studyâ€”was found to be the speed measure that best predicts safety. US data were used to develop a Bayesian Poisson-gamma safety model based on predicted AAS with random coefficients and varying dispersion parameter. This model structure was not appropriate for the Italian data used to examine whether the approach could be generalized to data for another country. For that data, a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model was found to be suitable. Notwithstanding the heterogeneity of the model structure, the investigation suggests that the indirect approach for evaluating the safety of a roundabout is a sound one in that it can preserve model parsimony while capturing the effects of design changes that affect safety.

20,"We combine Nagel's ""step-k"" model of boundedly rational players with a ""law of effect"" learning model. Players begin with a disposition to use one of the step-k rules of behavior, and over time the players learn how the available rules perform and switch to better performing rules. We offer an econometric specification of this dynamic process and fit it to Nagel's experimental data. We find that the rule of learning model vastly outperforms other nested and nonnested learning models. We find strong evidence for diverse dispositions and reject the Bayesian rule-learning model.

21,"Even though Bayesian estimation has recently become quite popular in item response theory (IRT), there is a lack of works on model checking from a Bayesian perspective. This paper applies the posterior predictive model checking (PPMC) method (Guttman, 1967; Rubin, 1984), a popular Bayesian model checking tool, to a number of real applications of unidimensional IRT models. The applications demonstrate how to exploit the flexibility of the posterior predictive checks to meet the need of the researcher. This paper also examines practical consequences of misfit, an area often ignored in educational measurement literature while assessing model fit.

22,"If a person is trained to recognize or categorize objects or events using one sensory modality, the person can often recognize or categorize those same (or similar) objects and events via a novel modality. This phenomenon is an instance of cross-modal transfer of knowledge. Here, we study the Multisensory Hypothesis which states that people extract the intrinsic, modality-independent properties of objects and events, and represent these properties in multisensory representations. These representations underlie cross-modal transfer of knowledge. We conducted an experiment evaluating whether people transfer sequence category knowledge across auditory and visual domains. Our experimental data clearly indicate that we do. We also developed a computational model accounting for our experimental results. Consistent with the probabilistic language of thought approach to cognitive modeling, our model formalizes multisensory representations as symbolic â€œcomputer programsâ€<U+FFFD> and uses Bayesian inference to learn these representations. Because the model demonstrates how the acquisition and use of amodal, multisensory representations can underlie cross-modal transfer of knowledge, and because the model accounts for subjectsâ€™ experimental performances, our work lends credence to the Multisensory Hypothesis. Overall, our work suggests that people automatically extract and represent objectsâ€™ and eventsâ€™ intrinsic properties, and use these properties to process and understand the same (and similar) objects and events when they are perceived through novel sensory modalities.

23,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to suggest a framework for sales forecasting more suitable for smaller firms. The authors examine the sales forecasting practices of small firms and then proceed to discuss the application of Bayesian decision theory in the production of sales forecasts, a method arguably more suited to the smaller firm. The authors suggest that many small firm entrepreneurs are inherently ""Bayesian"" in their thinking approach to predicting events in that they often rely on subjective estimates at least for initial starting values. Design/methodology/approach: A triangulated approach which uses qualitative group discussions and thematic content analysis, a reasonably large-scale questionnaire sample survey administered by post and analysed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests of association and a case study approach based on the authors own consultancy activities to illustrate the practical application of the forecasting model suggested. Findings: That many small firms use no formal sales forecasting framework at all. That the majority of small firm owners and/or managers rate sales forecasting skills very low in their list of priorities when given a choice of course to attend at subsidised rates. That there is no significant difference in the importance small firm owners and/or managers attach to formal sales forecasting skills. Research limitations/implications: Information has been gained from one geographic area in the north of England although the results may have a wider application to all small firms in the UK and elsewhere. Only the region's six most important industry sectors were included as stratification variables in the sample survey. Other regions will have a different mix of industries and will be stratified differently. Originality/value: The article addresses the sales forecasting needs of small firms specifically within the marketing for small business context and offers a realistic option with a clear rationale.

24,"Purpose: This study applies a Bayes analysis to the probability of a particular STATIC-99 score and its associated re-offence probability with recidivating for a sexual offence. We examine this probability over three time frames: within 5 years; within 10 years; and within 15 years. Methods: This study was conducted using the same data from Hanson and Thornton (1999). This dataset is constituted from four different samples: Institut Philippe Pinel (Canada) sample; Millbrook Recidivism Study (Canada) sample; Oak Ridge Division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Center (Canada) sample; and Her Majesty's Prison Service (UK) sample. The final sample for which sufficient information was available to score the STATIC-99 includes 1,086 sexual offenders. Bayes statistic has been used to analyze the data. Results: Results are consistent with the STATIC-99 as a useful assessment tool. The Bayes-generated probabilities as well as odds ratios show a consistent increase in increased likelihood of re-offence as the score value increases. Conclusions: The Bayesian analysis of the STATIC-99 shows that this method is very interesting in the context of risk assessment tools. This approach to risk assessment instruments may be more appropriate in the communication of analytic results as it can offer clinicians a combination of probabilities and likelihood ratios resulting a readily accessible profile of risk.

25,"Recently, analysis of structural equation models with polytomous and continuous variables has received a lot of attention. However, contributions to the selection of good models are limited. The main objective of this article is to investigate the maximum likelihood estimation of unknown parameters in a general LISREL-type model with mixed polytomous and continuous data and propose a model selection procedure for obtaining good models for the underlying substantive theory. The maximum likelihood estimate is obtained by a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm, in which the E step is evaluated via the Gibbs sampler and the M step is completed via the method of conditional maximization. The convergence of the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm is monitored by the bridge sampling. A model selection procedure based on Bayes factor and Occam's window search strategy is proposed. The effectiveness of the procedure in accounting for the model uncertainty and in picking good models is discussed. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a real example.
